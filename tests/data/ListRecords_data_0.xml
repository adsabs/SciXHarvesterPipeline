					<dc:title>Summing the curious series of Kempner and Irwin</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  In 1914, Kempner proved that the series 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/8 + 1/10 + 1/11 +
... + 1/18 + 1/20 + 1/21 + ... where the denominators are the positive integers
that do not contain the digit 9, converges to a sum less than 90. The actual
sum is about 22.92068. In 1916, Irwin proved, among other things, that the sum
of 1/n where n has at most a finite number of 9's is also a convergent series.
We show how to compute sums of Irwins' series to high precision. For example,
the sum of the series 1/9 + 1/19 + 1/29 + 1/39 + 1/49 + ... where the
denominators have exactly one 9, is about 23.04428 70807 47848 31968. Another
example: the sum of 1/n where n has exactly 100 zeros is about 10 ln(10) +
1.00745 x 10^-197 ~ 23.02585; note that the first, and largest, term in this
series is the tiny 1/googol. Finally, we discuss a class of related series
whose summation algorithm has not yet been developed.

					<dc:title>Toward an Interactive Directory for Norfolk, Nebraska: 1899-1900</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Allen, Robert B.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We describe steps toward an interactive directory for the town of Norfolk,
Nebraska for the years 1899 and 1900. This directory would extend the
traditional city directory by including a wider range of entities being
described, much richer information about the entities mentioned and linkages to
mentions of the entities in material such as digitized historical newspapers.
Such a directory would be useful to readers who browse the historical
newspapers by providing structured summaries of the entities mentioned. We
describe the occurrence of entities in two years of the Norfolk Weekly News,
focusing on several individuals to better understand the types of information
which can be gleaned from historical newspapers and other historical materials.
We also describe a prototype program which coordinates information about
entities from the traditional city directories, the federal census, and from
newspapers. We discuss the structured coding for these entities, noting that
richer coding would increasingly include descriptions of events and scenarios.
We propose that rich content about individuals and communities could eventually
be modeled with agents and woven into historical narratives.

					<dc:title>Generalized Bhattacharyya and Chernoff upper bounds on Bayes error using

					<dc:creator>Nielsen, Frank</dc:creator>

					<dc:description>  Bayesian classification labels observations based on given prior information,
namely class-a priori and class-conditional probabilities. Bayes' risk is the
minimum expected classification cost that is achieved by the Bayes' test, the
optimal decision rule. When no cost incurs for correct classification and unit
cost is charged for misclassification, Bayes' test reduces to the maximum a
posteriori decision rule, and Bayes risk simplifies to Bayes' error, the
probability of error. Since calculating this probability of error is often
intractable, several techniques have been devised to bound it with closed-form
formula, introducing thereby measures of similarity and divergence between
distributions like the Bhattacharyya coefficient and its associated
Bhattacharyya distance. The Bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened
using the Chernoff information that relies on the notion of best error
exponent. In this paper, we first express Bayes' risk using the total variation
distance on scaled distributions. We then elucidate and extend the
Bhattacharyya and the Chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized
weighted means. We provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical
divergences and affinity coefficients. We illustrate our technique by deriving
new upper bounds for the univariate Cauchy and the multivariate
$t$-distributions, and show experimentally that those bounds are not too
distant to the computationally intractable Bayes' error.

					<dc:description>  Edmund Landau's conjecture states that the set ${\mathcal P}_{n^2+1}$ of
primes of the form $n^2+1$ is infinite. Landau's conjecture implies the
following unproven statement $\Phi$: ${\rm card}({\mathcal P}_{n^2+1})&lt;\omega
\Rightarrow {\mathcal P}_{n^2+1} \subseteq [2,(((24!)!)!)!]$. We heuristically
justify the statement $\Phi$. This justification does not yield the
finiteness/infiniteness of ${\mathcal P}_{n^2+1}$. We present a new heuristic
argument for the infiniteness of ${\mathcal P}_{n^2+1}$, which is not based on
the statement $\Phi$. The distinction between algorithms whose existence is
provable in $ZFC$ and constructively defined algorithms which are currently
known inspires statements and open problems on decidable sets ${\mathcal X}
\subseteq {\mathbb N}$ that contain informal notions and refer to the current
knowledge on ${\mathcal X}$.

					<dc:title>Tiny-Shaped Particles Developing a Mono-Layer Shape Dealing with
  Localized Gravity and Levity at the Solution Surface</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Ali, Mubarak</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Materials Science</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In different solution-based methods and approaches, atoms first amalgamate at
an electronically flat-level solution surface. On dissociation from the
precursor, atoms amalgamate at the solution surface. On supplying the tuned
bipolar or unipolar pulses from different sources, the development of the tiny
particles is in triangular shapes. The developing tiny-shaped particles become
the building blocks of later developed bigger-sized particles. On development,
tiny-shaped particles leave the electronically flat-leveled solution surface.
By entering the electronically decreasing-level solution surface, tiny-shaped
particles arrive at the center of the concave meniscus. Through different
approaches, the nano energy packets supply to develop tiny-shaped particles. In
a triangular shape tiny particle, atomic arrays convert into structures of
smooth elements, where traveling photons along the air-solution interface
further flatten them. So, they nucleated a mono-layer shape. For later
coalesced tiny particles, structures of smooth elements adjacently adhered to
grow a nucleated mono-layer. The developing tiny-sized and tiny-shaped
particles do not appear to qualify for the extensively studied surface plasmons
phenomenon. In the upper-shaped mono-layer, the force of gravity becomes more
significant than the force of levity. The opposite is the case in the
lower-shaped mono-layer. Only a few microseconds are involved in adhering to
two mono-layers. The study highlights the development process of tiny-sized
particles in selective shapes. The study has great potential in the fields of
nanoscience and nanotechnology.

					<dc:title>Finite dimensional Hopf algebras over Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Shi, Yuxing</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Quantum Algebra</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Let $H_8$ be the neither commutative nor cocommutative semisimple eight
dimensional Hopf algebra, which is also called Kac-Paljutkin algebra
\cite{MR0208401}. All simple Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over $H_8$ are given. As
for simple objects and direct sums of two simple objects in
${}_{H_8}^{H_8}\mathcal{YD}$, we calculated dimensions for the corresponding
Nichols algebras, except four semisimple cases which are generally difficult.
Under the assumption that the four undetermined Nichols algebras are all
infinite dimensional, we determine all the finite dimensional Nichols algebras
over $H_8$. It turns out that the already known finite dimensional Nichols
algebras are all diagonal type. In fact, they are Cartan types $A_1$, $A_2$,
$A_2\times A_2$, $A_1\times \cdots \times A_1$, and $A_1\times \cdots \times
A_1\times A_2$. By the way, we calculate Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions for some
Nichols algebras. As an application, we obtain five families of new finite
dimensional Hopf algebras over $H_8$ according to the lifting method.

					<dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to prove the upper bound in Malle's conjecture
on the distribution of finite extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with specified
Galois group. As in previous work of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland, our result
is based upon computations of the homology of braid groups with certain
(exponential) coefficients. However, the approach in this paper is new, relying
on a connection between the cohomology of Hurwitz spaces and the cohomology of
quantum shuffle algebras.

					<dc:description>  The paper addresses the problem of computing maximal conditional expected
accumulated rewards until reaching a target state (briefly called maximal
conditional expectations) in finite-state Markov decision processes where the
condition is given as a reachability constraint. Conditional expectations of
this type can, e.g., stand for the maximal expected termination time of
probabilistic programs with non-determinism, under the condition that the
program eventually terminates, or for the worst-case expected penalty to be
paid, assuming that at least three deadlines are missed. The main results of
the paper are (i) a polynomial-time algorithm to check the finiteness of
maximal conditional expectations, (ii) PSPACE-completeness for the threshold
problem in acyclic Markov decision processes where the task is to check whether
the maximal conditional expectation exceeds a given threshold, (iii) a
pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the threshold problem in the general
(cyclic) case, and (iv) an exponential-time algorithm for computing the maximal
conditional expectation and an optimal scheduler.

					<dc:description>  The emotional response a person has to a living space is predominantly
affected by light, color and texture as space-making elements. In order to
verify whether this phenomenon could be replicated in a simulated environment,
we conducted a user study in a six-sided projected immersive display that
utilized equivalent design attributes of brightness, color and texture in order
to assess to which extent the emotional response in a simulated environment is
affected by the same parameters affecting real environments. Since emotional
response depends upon the context, we evaluated the emotional responses of two
groups of users: inactive (passive) and active (performing a typical daily
activity). The results from the perceptual study generated data from which
design principles for a virtual living space are articulated. Such a space, as
an alternative to expensive built dwellings, could potentially support new,
minimalist lifestyles of occupants, defined as the neo-nomads, aligned with
their work experience in the digital domain through the generation of emotional
experiences of spaces. Data from the experiments confirmed the hypothesis that
perceivable emotional aspects of real-world spaces could be successfully
generated through simulation of design attributes in the virtual space. The
subjective response to the virtual space was consistent with corresponding
responses from real-world color and brightness emotional perception. Our data
could serve the virtual reality (VR) community in its attempt to conceive of
further applications of virtual spaces for well-defined activities.

					<dc:description>  We prove that self-similar measures on the real line are absolutely
continuous for almost all parameters in the super-critical region, in
particular confirming a conjecture of S-M. Ngai and Y. Wang. While recently
there has been much progress in understanding absolute continuity for
homogeneous self-similar measures, this is the first improvement over the
classical transversality method in the general (non-homogeneous) case. In the
course of the proof, we establish new results on the dimension and Fourier
decay of a class of random self-similar measures.
</dc:description>
					<dc:description>Comment: v3: the statement of Theorem 1.3 was changed (the selection measure
  for the &quot;model&quot; of a random self-similar measure is assumed to be Bernoulli
  rather than an arbitrary ergodic shift-invariant measure; this was implicitly
  used in the proof. The original formulation is still correct; see the
  footnote on p.8 for details). The main result: Theorem 1.1 is unchanged</dc:description>

					<dc:title>The spinor string in a Clifford substructure of space-time</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Borchsenius, Kaare</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We factorize the space-time coordinates of Minkowski space into Weyl spinors
with components in a split Clifford algebra. Poisson brackets are defined for
Clifford-valued canonical variables and applied to the quantization of the
point particle and string. In particular, we obtain the Lorentz algebra for the
quantum string and show that the string can have half-integral spin. The
Clifford algebra is augmented with the octonions through an R-algebra tensor
product, and we apply the results of Manogue, Schray and Dray on octonionic
Lorentz transformations to obtain a Lorentz invariant string action in ten
dimensions.

					<dc:description>  The electronic and magneto transport properties of reduced anatase TiO2
epitaxial thin films are analyzed considering various polaronic effects.
Unexpectedly, with increasing carrier concentration, the mobility increases,
which rarely happens in common metallic systems. We find that the screening of
the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling by excess carriers is necessary to explain
this unusual dependence. We also find that the magnetoresistance (MR) could be
decomposed into a linear and a quadratic component, separately characterizing
the transport and trap behavior of carriers as a function of temperature. The
various transport behaviors could be organized into a single phase diagram
which clarifies the nature of large polaron in this material.

					<dc:description>  We classify pointed spaces according to the first fundamental group of their
reduced suspension. A pointed space is either of so-called totally path
disconnected type or of horseshoe type. These two camps are defined
topologically but a characterization is given in terms of fundamental groups.
Among totally path disconnected spaces the fundamental group is shown to be a
complete invariant for a notion of topological equivalence weaker than that of
homeomorphism.

among open, convex, bounded sets, namely $\min T_2(\Omega)
^{\frac{1}{N+2}}h_1(\Omega)$ among open convex bounded sets $\Omega \subset
\mathbb R^N$, where $T_2(\Omega)$ denotes the torsional rigidity of a set
$\Omega$ and $h_1(\Omega)$ its Cheeger constant. We prove the existence of an
optimal set and we conjecture that the ball is the unique minimizer. We provide
a sufficient condition for the validity of the conjecture, and an application
of the conjecture to prove a quantitative inequality for the Cheeger constant.
We also show lack of existence for the problem above among several other
classes of sets. As a side result we discuss the equivalence of the several
definitions of Cheeger constants present in the literature and show a quite
general class of sets for which those are equivalent.

					<dc:title>From Counterportation to Local Wormholes</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Salih, Hatim</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose an experimental realisation of the protocol for the counterfactual
disembodied transport of an unknown qubit -- or what we call counterportation
-- where sender and receiver, remarkably, exchange no particles. We employ
cavity quantum electrodynamics, estimating resources for beating the classical
fidelity limit -- except, unlike teleportation, no pre-shared entanglement nor
classical communication are required. Our approach is multiple orders of
magnitude more efficient in terms of physical resources than previously
proposed implementations, paving the way for a demonstration using existing
imperfect devices. Surprisingly, while such communication is intuitively
explained in terms of &quot;interaction-free&quot; measurement and the Zeno effect, we
show that neither is necessary, with far-reaching implications in support of an
underlying physical reality. We go on to characterise an explanatory framework
for counterportation starting from constructor theory: local wormholes.
Conversely, a counterportation experiment demonstrating the traversability of
space, by means of what is essentially a 2-qubit exchange-free quantum
computer, can point to the existence in the lab of such traversable wormholes.

					<dc:description>  Despite strong stability properties, the persistent homology of filtrations
classically used in Topological Data Analysis, such as, e.g. the Cech or
Vietoris-Rips filtrations, are very sensitive to the presence of outliers in
the data from which they are computed. In this paper, we introduce and study a
new family of filtrations, the DTM-filtrations, built on top of point clouds in
the Euclidean space which are more robust to noise and outliers. The approach
adopted in this work relies on the notion of distance-to-measure functions, and
extends some previous work on the approximation of such functions.

					<dc:description>  We introduce a flexible framework that produces high-quality almost-exact
matches for causal inference. Most prior work in matching uses ad-hoc distance
metrics, often leading to poor quality matches, particularly when there are
irrelevant covariates. In this work, we learn an interpretable distance metric
for matching, which leads to substantially higher quality matches. The learned
distance metric stretches the covariate space according to each covariate's
contribution to outcome prediction: this stretching means that mismatches on
important covariates carry a larger penalty than mismatches on irrelevant
covariates. Our ability to learn flexible distance metrics leads to matches
that are interpretable and useful for the estimation of conditional average
treatment effects.

					<dc:description>  We study the homogenization for a class of non-symmetric pure jump Feller
processes. The jump intensity involves periodic and aperiodic constituents, as
well as oscillating and non-oscillating constituents. This means that the noise
can come both from the underlying periodic medium and from external
environments, and is allowed to have different scales. It turns out that the
Feller process converges in distribution, as the scaling parameter goes to
zero, to a L\'evy process. As special cases of our result, some homogenization
problems studied in previous works can be recovered. We also generalize the
approach to the homogenization of symmetric stable-like processes with variable
order. Moreover, we present some numerical experiments to demonstrate the usage
of our homogenization results in the numerical approximation of first exit
times.

					<dc:description>  Supervised learning based on a deep neural network recently has achieved
substantial improvement on speech enhancement. Denoising networks learn mapping
from noisy speech to clean one directly, or to a spectrum mask which is the
ratio between clean and noisy spectra. In either case, the network is optimized
by minimizing mean square error (MSE) between ground-truth labels and
time-domain or spectrum output. However, existing schemes have either of two
critical issues: spectrum and metric mismatches. The spectrum mismatch is a
well known issue that any spectrum modification after short-time Fourier
transform (STFT), in general, cannot be fully recovered after inverse
short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). The metric mismatch is that a
conventional MSE metric is sub-optimal to maximize our target metrics,
signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ). This paper presents a new end-to-end denoising framework with the goal
of joint SDR and PESQ optimization. First, the network optimization is
performed on the time-domain signals after ISTFT to avoid spectrum mismatch.
Second, two loss functions which have improved correlations with SDR and PESQ
metrics are proposed to minimize metric mismatch. The experimental result
showed that the proposed denoising scheme significantly improved both SDR and
PESQ performance over the existing methods.

					<dc:description>  &quot;How much is my data worth?&quot; is an increasingly common question posed by
organizations and individuals alike. An answer to this question could allow,
for instance, fairly distributing profits among multiple data contributors and
determining prospective compensation when data breaches happen. In this paper,
we study the problem of data valuation by utilizing the Shapley value, a
popular notion of value which originated in cooperative game theory. The
Shapley value defines a unique payoff scheme that satisfies many desiderata for
the notion of data value. However, the Shapley value often requires exponential
time to compute. To meet this challenge, we propose a repertoire of efficient
algorithms for approximating the Shapley value. We also demonstrate the value
of each training instance for various benchmark datasets.

of topological data analysis. Many tools in persistent homology rely on the
properties of persistent Betti numbers considered as a two-dimensional
stochastic process $ (r,s) \mapsto n^{-1/2} (\beta^{r,s}_q (
\mathcal{K}(n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))-\mathbb{E}[\beta^{r,s}_q ( \mathcal{K}(
n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))])$. So far, pointwise limit theorems have been
established in different settings. In particular, the pointwise asymptotic
normality of (persistent) Betti numbers has been established for stationary
Poisson processes and binomial processes with constant intensity function in
the so-called critical (or thermodynamic) regime, see Yogeshwaran et al. [2017]
and Hiraoka et al. [2018].
  In this contribution, we derive a strong stabilization property (in the
spirit of Penrose and Yukich [2001] of persistent Betti numbers and generalize
the existing results on the asymptotic normality to the multivariate case and
to a broader class of underlying Poisson and binomial processes. Most
importantly, we show that the multivariate asymptotic normality holds for all
pairs $(r,s)$, $0\le r\le s&lt;\infty$, and that it is not affected by percolation
effects in the underlying random geometric graph.

					<dc:description>  The master equation for the reduced density matrix of a charged particle
interacting with a translation invariant weakly coupled environment is
considered. The electric current is renormalized by the system-environment
interaction, leading to a direct signature of the environment in the
bremsstrahlung. The general solution is given in the absence of the external
electromagnetic field and the spread and the decoherence of a wave packet are
followed. The increased complexity and importance of the boundary conditions
for the density matrix are pointed out.

					<dc:title>Revisiting Shor's quantum algorithm for computing general discrete
  logarithms</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Eker&#xe5;, Martin</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We heuristically show that Shor's algorithm for computing general discrete
logarithms achieves an expected success probability of approximately 60% to 82%
in a single run when modified to enable efficient implementation with the
semi-classical Fourier transform. By slightly increasing the number of group
operations that are evaluated quantumly and performing a single limited search
in the classical post-processing, or by performing two limited searches in the
post-processing, we show how the algorithm can be further modified to achieve a
success probability that heuristically exceeds 99% in a single run. We provide
concrete heuristic estimates of the success probability of the modified
algorithm, as a function of the group order $r$, the size of the search space
in the classical post-processing, and the additional number of group operations
evaluated quantumly. In the limit as $r \rightarrow \infty$, we heuristically
show that the success probability tends to one. In analogy with our earlier
works, we show how the modified quantum algorithm may be heuristically
simulated classically when the logarithm $d$ and $r$ are both known.
Furthermore, we heuristically show how slightly better tradeoffs may be
achieved, compared to our earlier works, if $r$ is known when computing $d$. We
generalize our heuristic to cover some of our earlier works, and compare it to
the non-heuristic analyses in those works.
</dc:description>
					<dc:description>Comment: The pre-print has been updated with an extended heuristic, that
  better captures the probability distribution for small $\varsigma$, and that
  reduces to the original heuristic for $B_\eta = 0$. Associated updates have
  been made to the post-processing, to support searching over $\eta$ when
  $B_\eta &gt; 0$. Various other associated updates, and improvements, additions
  and minor fixes, have been made</dc:description>

					<dc:description>  The quantum Hall states at filling factors $\nu=5/2$ and $7/2$ are expected
to have Abelian charge $e/2$ quasiparticles and non-Abelian charge $e/4$
quasiparticles. For the first time we report experimental evidence for the
non-Abelian nature of excitations at $\nu=7/2$ and examine the fermion parity,
a topological quantum number of an even number of non-Abelian quasiparticles,
by measuring resistance oscillations as a function of magnetic field in
Fabry-P\'erot interferometers using new high purity heterostructures. The phase
of observed $e/4$ oscillations is reproducible and stable over long times
(hours) near $\nu=5/2$ and $7/2$, indicating stability of the fermion parity.
When phase fluctuations are observed, they are predominantly $\pi$ phase flips,
consistent with fermion parity change. We also examine lower-frequency
oscillations attributable to Abelian interference processes in both states.
Taken together, these results constitute new evidence for the non-Abelian
nature of $e/4$ quasiparticles; the observed life-time of their combined
fermion parity further strengthens the case for their utility for topological
quantum computation.

					<dc:description>  It was conjectured by Escobar [J. Funct. Anal. 165 (1999), 101--116] that for
an $n$-dimensional ($n\geq 3$) smooth compact Riemannian manifold with
boundary, which has nonnegative Ricci curvature and boundary principal
curvatures bounded below by $c&gt;0$, the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue is
greater than or equal to $c$ with equality holding only on isometrically
Euclidean balls with radius $1/c$. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture in
the case of nonnegative sectional curvature. The proof is based on a
combination of Qiu--Xia's weighted Reilly-type formula with a special choice of
the weight function depending on the distance function to the boundary, as well
as a generalized Pohozaev-type identity.

					<dc:description>  We analyze the physics of self-bound droplets in a doubly dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate (DDBEC) composed by particles with both electric and
magnetic dipole moments. Using the particularly relevant case of dysprosium, we
show that the anisotropy of the doubly-dipolar interaction potential is highly
versatile and nontrivial, depending critically on the relative orientation and
strength between the two dipole moments. This opens novel possibilities for
exploring intriguing quantum many-body physics. Interestingly, by varying the
angle between the two dipoles we find a dimensional crossover from quasi
one-dimensional to quasi two-dimensional self-bound droplets. This opens a so
far unique scenario in condensate physics, in which a dimensional crossover is
solely driven by interactions in the absence of any confinement.

					<dc:description>  This paper completes the classification of the set $S$ of all real parameter
pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ such that the dilated floor functions $f_\alpha(x) =
\lfloor{\alpha x}\rfloor$, $f_\beta(x) = \lfloor{\beta x}\rfloor$ have a
nonnegative commutator, i.e. $ [ f_{\alpha}, f_{\beta}](x) = \lfloor{\alpha
\lfloor{\beta x}\rfloor}\rfloor - \lfloor{\beta \lfloor{\alpha

both dilation parameters $\alpha, \beta$ are negative. This result is
equivalent to classifying all positive $\alpha, \beta$ satisfying $
\lfloor{\alpha \lceil{\beta x}\rceil}\rfloor - \lfloor{\beta \lceil{\alpha
x}\rceil}\rfloor \geq 0$ for all real $x$. The classification analysis is
connected with the theory of Beatty sequences and with the Diophantine
Frobenius problem in two generators.

					<dc:description>  It is well known that some important Markov semi-groups have a
&quot;regularization effect&quot; -- as for example the hypercontractivity property of
the noise operator on the Boolean hypercube or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
semi-group on the real line, which applies to functions in $L^p$ for $p&gt;1$.
Talagrand had conjectured in 1989 that the noise operator on the Boolean
hypercube has a further subtle regularization property for functions that are
just integrable, but this conjecture remains open. Nonetheless, the Gaussian
analogue of this conjecture was proven in recent years by Eldan-Lee and Lehec,
by combining an inequality for the log-Hessian of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
semi-group with a new deviation inequality for log-semi-convex functions under
Gaussian measure. In this work, we explore the question of how much more
general this phenomenon is. Specifically, our first goal is to explore the
validity of both these ingredients for some diffusion semi-groups in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as for the $M/M/\infty$ queue on the non-negative
integers and the Laguerre semi-groups on the positive real line. Our second
goal is to prove a one-dimensional regularization effect for these settings,
even in those cases where these ingredients are not valid.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper presents a Distributed Stochastic Model Predictive Control
algorithm for networks of linear systems with multiplicative uncertainties and
local chance constraints on the states and control inputs. The chance
constraints are approximated via Cantelli's inequality by means of expected
value and covariance. The cooperative control algorithm is based on the
distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which renders the
controller fully distributedly implementable, recursively feasible and ensures
point-wise convergence of the states. The aforementioned properties are
guaranteed through a properly selected distributed invariant set and
distributed terminal constraints for the mean and covariance. The paper closes
with an example highlighting the chance constraint satisfaction, numerical
properties and scalability of our approach.

					<dc:description>  Thanks to the widespread deployment of TLS, users can access private data
over channels with end-to-end confidentiality and integrity. What they cannot
do, however, is prove to third parties the {\em provenance} of such data, i.e.,
that it genuinely came from a particular website. Existing approaches either
introduce undesirable trust assumptions or require server-side modifications.
  As a result, the value of users' private data is locked up in its point of
origin. Users cannot export their data with preserved integrity to other
applications without help and permission from the current data holder.
  We propose DECO (short for \underline{dec}entralized \underline{o}racle) to
address the above problems. DECO allows users to prove that a piece of data
accessed via TLS came from a particular website and optionally prove statements
about such data in zero-knowledge, keeping the data itself secret. DECO is the
first such system that works without trusted hardware or server-side
modifications.
  DECO can liberate data from centralized web-service silos, making it
accessible to a rich spectrum of applications. To demonstrate the power of
DECO, we implement three applications that are hard to achieve without it: a
private financial instrument using smart contracts, converting legacy
credentials to anonymous credentials, and verifiable claims against price
discrimination.

significant of these is the theory of Kleinian groups and Thurston's theory of

					<dc:description>  Investigations into the magnetic properties of sputtered Mn$_{x}$CoGe films
in the range $0.8 \leq x \leq 2.5$ uncovered ferrimagnetic order, unlike the
ferromagnetic order reported in bulk samples. These films formed hexagonal
Ni$_{2}$In-type structures when annealed at temperatures below 600$^{\circ}$C.
While the Curie temperatures of the films are comparable to those of hexagonal
bulk MnCoGe, there is a reduction in the magnetization of the Mn$_{x}$CoGe
films relative to bulk MnCoGe, and a magnetization compensation point is
observed in the $x&lt;1$ samples. To understand the behavior, we calculated the
magnetic moments of Mn-antisite defects in MnCoGe with density-function theory
(DFT) calculations. Models constructed from the calculation suggest that films
become ferrimagnetic due to the presence of Mn on the Co and Ge sites. In the
$x&lt;1$ samples, these defects arose from the disorder in the films, whereas for
$x&gt;1$, the excess Mn was driven onto the antisites. Mean field modeling of the
temperature dependence of the magnetization provides additional evidence for
ferrimagnetism. Our mean field and DFT models provide a description of how the
variation in film defects with composition will transition the magnetic
behavior from a compensated (V-type) to an uncompensated (Q-type) ferrimagnet.

					<dc:description>  While every matrix algebra over a field $K$ can be realized as a Leavitt path
algebra, this is not the case for every graded matrix algebra over a graded
field. We provide a complete description of graded matrix algebras over a
field, trivially graded by the ring of integers, which are graded isomorphic to
Leavitt path algebras. As a consequence, we show that there are graded corners
of Leavitt path algebras which are not graded isomorphic to Leavitt path
algebras. This contrasts a recent result stating that every corner of a Leavitt
path algebra of a finite graph is isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra. If $R$
is a finite direct sum of graded matricial algebras over a trivially graded
field and over naturally graded fields of Laurent polynomials, we also present
conditions under which $R$ can be realized as a Leavitt path algebra.

					<dc:description>  Detecting abrupt changes in the community structure of a network from noisy
observations is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. This
paper presents an online change detection algorithm called Spectral-CUSUM to
detect unknown network structure changes through a generalized likelihood ratio
statistic. We characterize the average run length (ARL) and the expected
detection delay (EDD) of the Spectral-CUSUM procedure and prove its asymptotic
optimality. Finally, we demonstrate the good performance of the Spectral-CUSUM
procedure and compare it with several baseline methods using simulations and
real data examples on seismic event detection using sensor network data.

					<dc:description>  Federated recommender systems have distinct advantages in terms of privacy
protection over traditional recommender systems that are centralized at a data
center. However, previous work on federated recommender systems does not fully
consider the limitations of storage, RAM, energy and communication bandwidth in
a mobile environment. The scales of the models proposed are too large to be
easily run on mobile devices. And existing federated recommender systems need
to fine-tune recommendation models on each device, making it hard to
effectively exploit collaborative filtering information among users/devices.
Our goal in this paper is to design a novel federated learning framework for
rating prediction (RP) for mobile environments. We introduce a federated matrix
factorization (MF) framework, named meta matrix factorization (MetaMF). Given a
user, we first obtain a collaborative vector by collecting useful information
with a collaborative memory module. Then, we employ a meta recommender module
to generate private item embeddings and a RP model based on the collaborative
vector in the server. To address the challenge of generating a large number of
high-dimensional item embeddings, we devise a rise-dimensional generation
strategy that first generates a low-dimensional item embedding matrix and a
rise-dimensional matrix, and then multiply them to obtain high-dimensional
embeddings. We use the generated model to produce private RPs for the given
user on her device. MetaMF shows a high capacity even with a small RP model,
which can adapt to the limitations of a mobile environment. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to compare MetaMF with
existing MF methods and find that MetaMF can achieve competitive performance.
Moreover, we find MetaMF achieves higher RP performance over existing federated
methods by better exploiting collaborative filtering among users/devices.

					<dc:description>  Let $(X,L_{X})$ be an $n$-dimensional polarized manifold. Let $D$ be a smooth
hypersurface defined by a holomorphic section of $L_{X}$. We prove that if $D$
has a constant positive scalar curvature K\&quot;{a}hler metric, $X \setminus D$
admits a complete scalar-flat K\&quot;{a}hler metric, under the following three
conditions: (i) $n \geq 6$ and there is no nonzero holomorphic vector field on
$X$ vanishing on $D$, (ii) an average of a scalar curvature on $D$ denoted by
$\hat{S}_{D}$ satisfies the inequality $0 &lt; 3 \hat{S}_{D} &lt; n(n-1)$, (iii)
there are positive integers $l(&gt;n),m$ such that the line bundle $K_{X}^{-l}
\otimes L_{X}^{m}$ is very ample and the ratio $m/l$ is sufficiently small.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we shed new light on the spectrum of the relation algebra we
call $A_{n}$, which is obtained by splitting the non-flexible diversity atom of
$6_{7}$ into $n$ symmetric atoms. Precisely, we show that the minimum value in
$\text{Spec}(A_{n})$ is at most $2n^{6 + o(1)}$, which is the first polynomial
bound and improves upon the previous bound due to Dodd \&amp; Hirsch (\textit{J.
Relational Methods in Computer Science} 2013). We also improve the lower bound
to $2n^{2} + 4n + 1$, which is asymptotically double the trivial bound of
$n^{2} + 2n + 3$.
  In the process, we obtain stronger results regarding $\text{Spec}(A_{2})
=\text{Spec}(32_{65})$. Namely, we show that $1024$ is in the spectrum, and no
number smaller than 26 is in the spectrum. Our improved lower bounds were
obtained by employing a SAT solver, which suggests that such tools may be more
generally useful in obtaining representation results.

					<dc:creator>Elworthy, K. D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Li, Xue-Mei</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  An approach to analysis on path spaces of Riemannian manifolds is described.
The spaces are furnished with `Brownian motion' measure which lies on
continuous paths, though differentiation is restricted to directions given by
tangent paths of finite energy. An introduction describes the background for
paths on ${\mathbb R}^m$ and Malliavin calculus. For manifold valued paths the
approach is to use `It\^o' maps of suitable stochastic differential equations
as charts . `Suitability' involves the connection determined by the stochastic
differential equation. Some fundamental open problems concerning the calculus
and the resulting `Laplacian' are described. A theory for more general
diffusion measures is also briefly indicated. The same method is applied as an
approach to getting over the fundamental difficulty of defining exterior
differentiation as a closed operator, with success for one \&amp; two forms leading
to a Hodge -Kodaira operator and decomposition for such forms. Finally there is
a brief description of some related results for loop spaces.

					<dc:description>  Given a sample of an abstract manifold immersed in some Euclidean space, we
describe a way to recover the singular homology of the original manifold. It
consists in estimating its tangent bundle -- seen as subset of another
Euclidean space -- in a measure theoretic point of view, and in applying
measure-based filtrations for persistent homology. The construction we propose
is consistent and stable, and does not involve the knowledge of the dimension
of the manifold. In order to obtain quantitative results, we introduce the
normal reach, which is a notion of reach suitable for an immersed manifold.

					<dc:title>Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images Using MSBs Integration and

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper presents a reversible data hiding in encrypted image that employs
based notions of the RDH in plain-image schemes including histogram
modification and prediction-error computation. In the proposed method, original
image may be encrypted by desire encryption algorithm. Most significant bit
(MSB) of encrypted pixels are integrated to vacate room for embedding data
bits. Integrated ones will be more resistant against failure of reconstruction
if they are modified for embedding data bits. At the recipient, we employ
chess-board predictor for lossless reconstruction of the original image by the
aim of prediction-error analysis. Comparing to existent RDHEI algorithms, not
only we propose a separable method to extract data bits, but also content-owner
may attain a perfect reconstruction of the original image without having data
hider key. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state of the art ones.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study lower order terms of the $1$-level density of
low-lying zeros of quadratic Hecke L-functions in the Gaussian field. Assuming
the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, our result is valid for even test functions
whose Fourier transforms are supported in $(-2, 2)$. Moreover, we apply the
ratios conjecture of $L$-functions to derive these lower order terms as well.
Up to the first lower order term, we show that our results is consistent with
each other, when the Fourier transforms of the test functions are supported in
$(-2, 2)$.

					<dc:title>Optimization of Convolutional Neural Network Using the Linearly

					<dc:description>  Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep
learning techniques. Various forms of models have been proposed and im-proved
for learning at CNN. When learning with CNN, it is necessary to determine the
optimal hyperparameters. However, the number of hyperparameters is so large
that it is difficult to do it manually, so much research has been done on
automation. A method that uses metaheuristic algorithms is attracting attention
in research on hyperparameter optimization. Metaheuristic algorithms are
naturally inspired and include evolution strategies, genetic algorithms,
antcolony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In particular, particle
swarm optimization converges faster than genetic algorithms, and various models
have been proposed. In this paper, we pro-pose CNN hyperparameter optimization
with linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO). In the
experiment, the MNIST data set and CIFAR-10 data set, which are often used as
benchmark data sets, are used. By opti-mizing CNN hyperparameters with LDWPSO,
learning the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we compare the accuracy with a
standard CNN based on LeNet-5. As a result, when using the MNIST dataset, the
baseline CNN is 94.02% at the 5th epoch, compared to 98.95% for LDWPSO CNN,
which improves accuracy. When using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the Baseline CNN is
28.07% at the 10th epoch, compared to 69.37% for the LDWPSO CNN, which greatly
improves accuracy. This paper is presented at the 36th Annual Conference of the

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel stochastic output-feedback MPC scheme for
distributed systems with additive process and measurement noise. The chance
constraints are treated with the concept of probabilistic reachable sets,
which, under an unimodality assumption on the disturbance distributions are
guaranteed to be satisfied in closed-loop. By conditioning the initial state of
the optimization problem on feasibility, the fundamental property of recursive
feasibility is ensured. Closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction, recursive
feasibility and convergence to an asymptotic average cost bound are proven. The
paper closes with a numerical example of three interconnected subsystems,
highlighting the chance constraint satisfaction and average cost compared to a
centralized setting.

					<dc:title>Security of HyperLogLog (HLL) Cardinality Estimation: Vulnerabilities

					<dc:creator>Reviriego, Pedro</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Ting, Daniel</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Count distinct or cardinality estimates are widely used in network monitoring
for security. They can be used, for example, to detect the malware spread,
network scans, or a denial of service attack. There are many algorithms to
estimate cardinality. Among those, HyperLogLog (HLL) has been one of the most
widely adopted. HLL is simple, provides good cardinality estimates over a wide
range of values, requires a small amount of memory, and allows merging of
estimates from different sources. However, as HLL is increasingly used to
detect attacks, it can itself become the target of attackers that want to avoid
being detected. To the best of our knowledge, the security of HLL has not been
studied before. In this letter, we take an initial step in its study by first
exposing a vulnerability of HLL that allows an attacker to manipulate its
estimate. This shows the importance of designing secure HLL implementations. In
the second part of the letter, we propose an efficient protection technique to
detect and avoid the HLL manipulation. The results presented strongly suggest
that the security of HLL should be further studied given that it is widely
adopted in many networking and computing applications.

					<dc:description>  The theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies is a generalization of that of Newton
polytopes for toric varieties, and it gives a systematic method of constructing
toric degenerations of projective varieties. In this paper, we study
Newton-Okounkov bodies of Schubert varieties from the theory of cluster
algebras. We construct Newton-Okounkov bodies using specific valuations which
generalize extended g-vectors in cluster theory, and discuss how these bodies
are related to string polytopes and Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes.

					<dc:description>  We consider a new geometric approach to Madelung's quantum hydrodynamics
(QHD) based on the theory of gauge connections. In particular, our treatment
comprises a constant curvature thereby endowing QHD with intrinsic non-zero
holonomy. In the hydrodynamic context, this leads to a fluid velocity which no
longer is constrained to be irrotational and allows instead for vortex
filaments solutions. After exploiting the Rasetti-Regge method to couple the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation to vortex filament dynamics, the latter is then
considered as a source of geometric phase in the context of Born-Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics. Similarly, we consider the Pauli equation for the motion of
spin particles in electromagnetic fields and we exploit its underlying
hydrodynamic picture to include vortex dynamics.

					<dc:title>The meaning of torsion in teleparallel theories</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Formiga, J. B.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The ambiguity of the Weitzenb\&quot;ock connection and the meaning of torsion in
teleparallel theories are investigated. A new postulate is added to
teleparallel theories in order to remove the ambiguity and the inconsistencies
in the calculation of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor and the like. In
addition to the known restrictions on the spatial triad, it is shown that some
restrictions on the congruence used to build the frame must also be imposed.
Nevertheless, no restriction is imposed on a particular observer's worldline.
The postulate and the restriction presented in this article are used to define
what will be called here an ideal frame. This definition is applied to the
Schwarzschild and the pp-wave spacetimes in the context of the Teleparallel
Equivalent of General Relativity. In both cases, the results are very appealing
and consistent; this includes the impossibility of making the gravitational
energy density vanish along the accelerated observers' worldlines used here.
Two promising interpretations for the Weitzenb\&quot;ock torsion are presented and
discussed in detail. The possibility of having a well defined concept of an
absolute vacuum in teleparallel theories is also discussed. Finally, some
possible solutions to well-known problems of the f(T) theories are proposed.

					<dc:title>Stochastic MPC with Distributionally Robust Chance Constraints</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Mark, Christoph</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Liu, Steven</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper we discuss distributional robustness in the context of
stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) for linear time-invariant systems.
We derive a simple approximation of the MPC problem under an additive zero-mean
i.i.d. noise with quadratic cost. Due to the lack of distributional
information, chance constraints are enforced as distributionally robust (DR)
chance constraints, which we opt to unify with the concept of probabilistic
reachable sets (PRS). For Wasserstein ambiguity sets, we propose a simple
convex optimization problem to compute the DR-PRS based on finitely many
disturbance samples. The paper closes with a numerical example of a double
integrator system, highlighting the reliability of the DR-PRS w.r.t. the
Wasserstein set and performance of the resulting SMPC.

					<dc:title>Two repelling random walks on $\mathbb Z$</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  We consider two interacting random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ such that the
transition probability of one walk in one direction decreases exponentially
with the number of transitions of the other walk in that direction. The joint
process may thus be seen as two random walks reinforced to repel each other.
The strength of the repulsion is further modulated in our model by a parameter
$\beta \geq 0$. When $\beta = 0$ both processes are independent symmetric
random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, and hence recurrent. We show that both random
walks are further recurrent if $\beta \in (0,1]$. We also show that these
processes are transient and diverge in opposite directions if $\beta &gt; 2$. The
case $\beta \in (1,2]$ remains widely open. Our results are obtained by
considering the dynamical system approach to stochastic approximations.

					<dc:description>Comment: 17 pages. Added references and corrected typos. Revised the argument
  for the convergence to equilibria of the vector field. Improved the proof for
  the recurrence when beta belongs to (0,1); leading to the removal of a

					<dc:description>  For a univariate real polynomial without zero coefficients, Descartes' rule
of signs (completed by an observation of Fourier) says that its numbers $pos$
of positive and $neg$ of negative roots (counted with multiplicity) are
majorized respectively by the numbers $c$ and $p$ of sign changes and sign
preservartions in the sequence of its coefficients, and that the differences
$c-pos$ and $p-neg$ are even numbers. For degree 5 polynomials, it has been
proved by A.~Albouy and Y.~Fu that there exist no such polynomials having three
distinct positive and no negative roots and whose signs of the coefficients are
$(+,+,-,+,-,-)$ (or having three distinct negative and no positive roots and
whose signs of the coefficients are $(+,-,-,-,-,+)$). For degree 5 and when the
leading coefficient is positive, these are all cases of numbers of positive and
negative roots (all distinct) and signs of the coefficients which are
compatible with Descartes' rule of signs, but for which there exist no such
polynomials. We explain this non-existence and the existence in all other cases
with $d=5$ by means of pictures showing the discriminant set of the family of
polynomials $x^5+x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ together with the coordinate axes.

					<dc:description>  Quantile is an important measure in finance and quality assessment in service
industry. In this paper, we model the temporal and cross-sectional interactive
effect of the quantiles of large-dimensional time series by a latent quantile
factor model. The factor loadings and scores are learnt with statistical
guarantee via an iterative check-loss-minimization procedure. Without any
moment constraint on the idiosyncratic errors, we correctly identify the common
and idiosyncratic components for each variable. We obtained the statistical
convergence rates of the minimization estimators. Bahardur representations for
the estimated factor loadings and scores are provided under some mild
conditions. Moreover, a robust method is proposed to select the number of
factors consistently. Simulation experiments checked the validity of the
theory. Our analysis on a financial data set shows the superiority of learning
quantile factors in portfolio allocation over other state-of-the-art methods
that learn mean factors.

					<dc:description>  Over the last two decades, tremendous advances have been made for
constructing large-scale quantum computers. In particular, the quantum
processor architecture based on superconducting qubits has become the leading
candidate for scalable quantum computing platform, and the milestone of
demonstrating quantum supremacy was first achieved using 53 superconducting
qubits in 2019. In this work, we provide a brief review on the experimental
efforts towards building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer,
including qubit design, quantum control, readout techniques, and the
implementations of error correction and quantum algorithms. Besides the state
of the art, we finally discuss future perspectives, and which we hope will
motivate further research.

					<dc:description>  We prove a functional limit theorem for vector-valued functionals of the
fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, providing the foundation for the
fluctuation theory of slow/fast systems driven by such a noise. Our main
contribution is on the joint convergence to a limit with both Gaussian and
non-Gaussian components. This is valid for any $L^2$ functions, whereas for
functions with stronger integrability properties the convergence is shown to
hold in the H\&quot;older topology. As an application we prove a `rough creation'
result, i.e. the weak convergence of a family of random smooth curves to a
non-Markovian random process with rough sample paths. This includes the second
order problem and the kinetic fractional Brownian motion model.

					<dc:title>Comparison of correlation-based measures of concordance in terms of

					<dc:subject>62H20, 62H12</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We compare measures of concordance that arise as Pearson's linear correlation
coefficient between two random variables transformed so that they follow the
so-called concordance-inducing distributions. The class of such transformed
rank correlations includes Spearman's rho, Blomqvist's beta and van der
Waerden's coefficient. When only the standard axioms of measures of concordance
are required, it is not always clear which transformed rank correlation is most
suitable to use. To address this question, we compare measures of concordance
in terms of their best and worst asymptotic variances of some canonical
estimators over a certain set of dependence structures. A simple criterion
derived from this approach is that concordance-inducing distributions with
smaller fourth moment are more preferable. In particular, we show that
Blomqvist's beta is the optimal transformed rank correlation in this sense, and
Spearman's rho outperforms van der Waerden's coefficient. Moreover, we find
that Kendall's tau, although it is not a transformed rank correlation of that
nature, shares a certain optimal structure with Blomqvist's beta.

mechanism is given. This is done by showing exponential decay of the two point
fermionic correlation function in a weakly coupled U(1) Higgs-Yukawa theory on
a unit lattice in $d=4$. This decay implies that the Higgs boson, the photon
and the fermion all have a non zero physical mass and the theory is said to

					<dc:description>  A linear ordering is called context-free if it is the lexicographic ordering
of some context-free language and is called scattered if it has no dense
subordering. Each scattered ordering has an associated ordinal, called its
rank. It is known that scattered context-free (regular, resp.) orderings have

  In this paper we confirm the conjecture that one-counter languages have rank
less than $\omega^2$.

					<dc:description>  We propose an inexpensive scalable approach for achieving extremely high
values of Seebeck coefficient ($\alpha$) by exploiting the natural superlattice
structure in Aurivillius phase oxides. In particular, we report an $\alpha
\approx $ 319\,mV/K at 300\,K in a composite of Aurivillius phase compound
SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ (as a matrix) and a perovskite phase material (e.g.,
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ or, La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ as filler). Such a
colossal value of $\alpha$ can be attributed to contributions from the enhanced
density of states due to the effective low dimensional character of Bi$_2$O$_2$
layer. The corresponding thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) and the electrical
conductivity ($\sigma$) lies in the range 0.7 - 1.25 W/m-K and 10 - 100
$\mu$S/m, respectively at 300\,K. Attributed to the high $\alpha$ values, such
oxide composites can be used as thermopile sensors and highly sensitive
bolometric applications. We anticipate that the demonstration of colossal
$\alpha$ in oxide composites using a simple synthesis strategy also sets the
stage for future material innovations for high temperature thermoelectric
applications.

					<dc:description>  Generalizing stack sorting and $c$-sorting for permutations, we define the
permutree sorting algorithm. Given two disjoint subsets $U$ and $D$ of $\{2,
\dots, n-1\}$, the $(U,D)$-permutree sorting tries to sort the permutation $\pi
\in \mathfrak{S}_n$ and fails if and only if there are $1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n$
such that $\pi$ contains the subword $jki$ if $j \in U$ and $kij$ if $j \in D$.
This algorithm is seen as a way to explore an automaton which either rejects
all reduced expressions of $\pi$, or accepts those reduced expressions for
$\pi$ whose prefixes are all $(U,D)$-permutree sortable.

					<dc:description>  Context:Software Development Analytics is a research area concerned with
providing insights to improve product deliveries and processes. Many types of
studies, data sources and mining methods have been used for that purpose.
Objective:This systematic literature review aims at providing an aggregate view
of the relevant studies on Software Development Analytics in the past decade,
with an emphasis on its application in practical settings. Method:Definition
and execution of a search string upon several digital libraries, followed by a
quality assessment criteria to identify the most relevant papers. On those, we
extracted a set of characteristics (study type, data source, study perspective,
development life-cycle activities covered, stakeholders, mining methods, and
analytics scope) and classified their impact against a taxonomy. Results:Source
code repositories, experimental case studies, and developers are the most
common data sources, study types, and stakeholders, respectively. Product and
project managers are also often present, but less than expected. Mining methods
are evolving rapidly and that is reflected in the long list identified.
Descriptive statistics are the most usual method followed by correlation
analysis. Being software development an important process in every
organization, it was unexpected to find that process mining was present in only
one study. Most contributions to the software development life cycle were given
in the quality dimension. Time management and costs control were lightly
debated. The analysis of security aspects suggests it is an increasing topic of
concern for practitioners. Risk management contributions are scarce.
Conclusions:There is a wide improvement margin for software development
analytics in practice. For instance, mining and analyzing the activities
performed by software developers in their actual workbench, the IDE.

					<dc:title>Support Aggregate Analytic Window Function over Large Data by Spilling</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Shi, Xing</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Wang, Chao</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Analytic function, also called window function, is to query the aggregation
of data over a sliding window. For example, a simple query over the online
stock platform is to return the average price of a stock of the last three
days. These functions are commonly used features in SQL databases. They are
supported in most of the commercial databases. With the increasing usage of
cloud data infra and machine learning technology, the frequency of queries with
analytic window functions rises. Some analytic functions only require const
space in memory to store the state, such as SUM, AVG, while others require
linear space, such as MIN, MAX. When the window is extremely large, the memory
space to store the state may be too large. In this case, we need to spill the
state to disk, which is a heavy operation. In this paper, we proposed an
algorithm to manipulate the state data in the disk to reduce the disk I/O to
make spill available and efficienct. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm
with different data distribution.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, the statistical properties of the product of independent and
non-identically distributed mixture Gamma (MG) random variables (RVs) are
provided first. Specifically, simple exact closed-form expressions for the
probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and
moment generating function (MGF) are derived in terms of univariate Meijer's
$G$-function. The statistical characterisations of the distribution of the
ratio of products of MG variates are then derived. These statistics are used to
analyse the outage probability (OP), the average error probability for
different modulation schemes, the effective rate (ER) of communications systems
and the average area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve
of energy detection over cascaded fading channels. Additionally, the lower
bound of secure outage probability (SOP$^L$) and probability of non-zero
secrecy capacity (PNSC) of the physical layer and the OP of the multihop
communications systems with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol and
co-channel interference (CCI) are studied by utilising the statistics of the
ratio of the products. The derived performance metrics are applied for the
Beaulieu-Xie and $\alpha-\lambda-\eta-\mu$ shadowed fading channels that have
not been yet investigated in the literature. Accordingly, the equivalent
parameters of a MG distribution for the aforementioned channels are given. A
comparison between the numerical results and the Monte Carlo simulations is
presented to verify the validation of our analysis.

					<dc:description>  Given a manifold $M$ and a point in its interior, the point-pushing map
describes a diffeomorphism that pushes the point along a closed path. This
defines a homomorphism from the fundamental group of $M$ to the group of
isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of $M$ that fix the basepoint. This map is
well-studied in dimension $d = 2$ and is part of the Birman exact sequence.
Here we study, for any $d \geqslant 3$ and $k \geqslant 1$, the map from the
$k$-th braid group of $M$ to the group of homotopy classes of homotopy
equivalences of the $k$-punctured manifold $M \smallsetminus z$, and analyse
its injectivity. Equivalently, we describe the monodromy of the universal
bundle that associates to a configuration $z$ of size $k$ in $M$ its
complement, the space $M \smallsetminus z$. Furthermore, motivated by our work
on the homology of configuration-mapping spaces, we describe the action of the
braid group of $M$ on the fibres of configuration-mapping spaces.

					<dc:description>  ITensor is a system for programming tensor network calculations with an
interface modeled on tensor diagram notation, which allows users to focus on
the connectivity of a tensor network without manually bookkeeping tensor
indices. The ITensor interface rules out common programming errors and enables
rapid prototyping of tensor network algorithms. After discussing the philosophy
behind the ITensor approach, we show examples of each part of the interface
including Index objects, the ITensor product operator, tensor factorizations,
tensor storage types, algorithms for matrix product state (MPS) and matrix
product operator (MPO) tensor networks, quantum number conserving block-sparse
tensors, and the NDTensors library. We also review publications that have used
ITensor for quantum many-body physics and for other areas where tensor networks
are increasingly applied. To conclude we discuss promising features and
optimizations to be added in the future.

					<dc:title>Aggregate Analytic Window Query over Spatial Data</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Shi, Xing</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Wang, Chao</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Analytic window query is a commonly used query in the relational databases.
It answers the aggregations of data over a sliding window. For example, to get
the average prices of a stock for each day. However, it is not supported in the
spatial databases. Because the spatial data are not in a one-dimension space,
there is no straightforward way to extend the original analytic window query to
spatial databases. But these queries are useful and meaningful. For example, to
find the average number of visits for all the POIs in the circle with a fixed
radius for each POI as the centre. In this paper, we define the aggregate
analytic window query over spatial data and propose algorithms for grid index
and tree-index. We also analyze the complexity of the algorithms to prove they
are efficient and practical.

					<dc:title>Geodesics in the Brownian map: Strong confluence and geometric structure</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Miller, Jason</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Qian, Wei</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study geodesics in the Brownian map $(\mathcal{S},d,\nu)$, the random
metric measure space which arises as the Gromov-Hausdorff scaling limit of
uniformly random planar maps. Our results apply to all geodesics including
those between exceptional points.
  First, we prove a strong and quantitative form of the confluence of geodesics
phenomenon which states that any pair of geodesics which are sufficiently close
in the Hausdorff distance must coincide with each other except near their
endpoints.
  Then, we show that the intersection of any two geodesics minus their
endpoints is connected, the number of geodesics which emanate from a single
point and are disjoint except at their starting point is at most $5$, and the
maximal number of geodesics which connect any pair of points is $9$. For each
$1\le k \le 9$, we obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the pairs of points
connected by exactly $k$ geodesics. For $k=7,8,9$, such pairs have dimension
zero and are countably infinite. Further, we classify the (finite number of)
possible configurations of geodesics between any pair of points in
$\mathcal{S}$, up to homeomorphism, and give a dimension upper bound for the
set of endpoints in each case.
  Finally, we show that every geodesic can be approximated arbitrarily well and
in a strong sense by a geodesic connecting $\nu$-typical points. In particular,
this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Angel, Kolesnik, and
Miermont that the geodesic frame of $\mathcal{S}$, the union of all of the
geodesics in $\mathcal{S}$ minus their endpoints, has dimension one, the
dimension of a single geodesic.

of a 1D discrete nonlinear Anderson model. We remove completely the decaying
condition restricted on the nonlinearity of Bourgain-Wang (Ann. of Math. Stud.

					<dc:description>  We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey
degrees, and we discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter
spaces and the Carlson--Simpson theorem rather than (a strengthening of) the
Halpern--L\&quot;auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically
used to bound big Ramsey degrees in existing literature (originating from work
of Laver and Milliken). This new technique has many additional applications. We
show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey
degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover,
generalizing indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and
Sauer, we give upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely
many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation
stability of the Urysohn Sphere.

correlation between the particle size of the dispersed phase and interface
thermal resistance (R_{int}) on the phonon thermal conductivity (\kappa_{ph})
is discussed. With this aim, a series of PbTe-CoSb_3 polycrystalline composite
materials with the different particle sizes of CoSb_3 was prepared. The
structural (XRD) and microstructural analysis (SEM/EDXS) confirmed assumed
chemical and phase compositions. The acoustic impedance difference (\Delta Z)
was determined from measured sound velocities in PbTe and CoSb_3 phases. The
interface thermal resistance (R_{int}) was calculated using the Debye model and
agrees with the experimental R_{int}. It is shown that the \kappa_{ph} of the
composite may be reduced when the particle size of the dispersed phase (CoSb_3)
is smaller than the critical value of ~230nm. This relationship was concluded
to be crucial for controlling the heat transport phenomena in composite
thermoelectric materials. The selection of the components with different
elastic properties (acoustic impedance) and particle size smaller than the
Kapitza radius leads to a new direction in the engineering of composite TE
materials with designed thermal properties

					<dc:description>  We present a novel approach to reduce the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) in
thermoelectric composite materials using acoustic impedance mismatch and the
Debye model. Also, the correlation between interface thermal resistance
(R$_{int}$) and the particle size of the dispersed phase on the k of the
composite is discussed. In particular, the $\kappa$ of an oxide composite which
consists of a natural superlattice Aurivillius phase (SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$)
as a matrix and perovskite (La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$) as a dispersed phase
is investigated. A significant reduction in the $\kappa$ of composite, even
lower than the $\kappa$ of the matrix when the particle size of
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ is smaller than the Kapitza radius (a$_K$) is
observed, depicting that R$_{int}$ dominates for particle size lower than a$_K$
due to increased surface to volume ratio. The obtained results have the
potential to provide new directions for engineering composite thermoelectric
systems with desired thermal conductivity and promising in the field of energy
harvesting.

					<dc:title>Effect of interface resistance on thermoelectric properties in

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Materials Science</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this study, the synergistic effect of the particle size of the dispersed
phase and the interface thermal resistance (R$_{int}$) between the phases on
the phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) of the
(1-x)La$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$Co$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$O$_3$/(x)WC thermoelectric
composite, is demonstrated. Further, the correlation between the R$_{int}$ and
the Kapitza radius is discussed using the Bruggeman's asymmetrical model. In
particular, the polycrystalline
La$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$Co$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$O$_3$ sample is synthesized using a
standard-solid state route. The presence of WC nanoparticle is confirmed from
the electron microscopy images. Electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) increases,
and the Seebeck coefficient ($\alpha$) decreases with the increase in
conducting WC volume fraction in the composite. The simultaneous increase in
$\sigma$ and a decrease in $\kappa_{ph}$ with the WC volume fraction results in
an increased figure of merit (zT) for
(1-x)La$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$Co$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$O$_3$/(x)WC composite. A
maximum zT $\sim$ 0.20 is obtained for
(1-x)La$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$Co$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$O$_3$/(x)WC composite for
x=0.010 at 463 K. The results obtained in the present study shows promise to
design thermoelectric composites with desired phonon thermal conductivity
considering the elastic properties between the phases.

					<dc:description>  We discuss the generic geometric properties of metrics $\widehat {g}_{ab}$
constructed from Lorentzian metric $g_{ab}$ and a nowhere vanishing,
hypersurface orthogonal, timelike vector field $u^a$. The metric ${\widehat
g}_{ab}$ has Euclidean signature in a certain domain, with the transition to
Lorentzian signature occurring at some hypersurface $\Sigma$ orthogonal to
$u^a$. Geometry associated with ${\widehat g}_{ab}$ has recently been shown to
yield remarkable new insights for classical and quantum gravity. In this work,
we prove several general results applicable in physically relevant spacetimes
for congruences $u^i$ with non-zero acceleration $a^i$. We present as examples
the cases of dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes and spacetimes with
maximal symmetry. We also investigate this formalism within the context of
thermal effects in curved spacetimes with horizons. Specifically, we discuss:
(i) the Holonomy of loops lying partially or wholly in the Euclidean regime. We
show that the contribution of the Euclidean domain to holonomy is completely
determined by extrinsic curvature $K_{ab}$ of $\Sigma$ and acceleration $a^i$.
(ii) We also compute entropy using this formalism for simple field theories and
obtain foliation dependent corrections for the Lanczos-Lovelock gravity,
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy relation in four spacetime dimensions.

					<dc:subject>60F17, 60G50, 11S82</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A $p$-adic Brownian motion is a continuous time stochastic process in a
$p$-adic state space that has a Vladimirov operator as its infinitesimal
generator. The current work shows that any such process is the scaling limit of
a discrete time random walk on a discrete group. Earlier work required the
exponent of the Vladimirov operator to be in $(1, \infty)$ and the convergence
was limited to be the weak-$\ast$ convergence in the space of bounded measures
on the Skorohod space of paths on a compact time interval. The current approach
simplifies the earlier approach, allows for any positive exponent, eliminates
the restriction to compact time intervals, and establishes some moment
estimates for the discrete time processes that are of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  Given a graph $G$ on the vertex set $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$ with the root vertex
$0$, Postnikov and Shapiro associated a monomial ideal $\mathcal{M}_G$ in the
polynomial ring $R=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$ such
that $\dim_{\mathbb{K}}(R/\mathcal{M}_G)=\det\widetilde L_G$, where $\widetilde
L_G$ is the truncated Laplacian of $G$. Dochtermann introduced the $1$-skeleton
ideal $\mathcal{M}_G^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{M}_G$ which satisfies the property
that $\dim_{\mathbb{K}}(R/\mathcal{M}_G^{(1)})\ge\det\widetilde Q_G$, where
$\widetilde Q_G$ is the truncated signless Laplacian of $G$. In this paper we
characterize all subgraphs of the multigraph $K_{n+1}^{a,1}$, in particular all
simple graphs $G$, such that
$\dim_{\mathbb{K}}(R/\mathcal{M}_G^{(1)})=\det\widetilde Q_G$. Moreover, we
give examples of subgraphs $G$ of the complete multigraph $K_{n+1}^{a,b}$, in
which the equality $\dim_{\mathbb{K}}(R/\mathcal{M}_G^{(1)})=\det\widetilde
Q_G$ holds. We also provide a conjecture on the structure of a general
multigraph satisfying the above-mentioned equality.

					<dc:description>  Context : Software comprehension and maintenance activities, such as
refactoring, are said to be negatively impacted by software complexity. The
methods used to measure software product and processes complexity have been
thoroughly debated in the literature. However, the discernment about the
possible links between these two dimensions, particularly on the benefits of
using the process perspective, has a long journey ahead. Objective: To improve
the understanding of the liaison of developers' activities and software
complexity within a refactoring task, namely by evaluating if process metrics
gathered from the IDE, using process mining methods and tools, are suitable to
accurately classify different refactoring practices and the resulting software
complexity. Method: We mined source code metrics from a software product after
a quality improvement task was given in parallel to (117) software developers,
organized in (71) teams. Simultaneously, we collected events from their IDE
work sessions (320) and used process mining to model their processes and
extract the correspondent metrics. Results: Most teams using a plugin for
refactoring (JDeodorant) reduced software complexity more effectively and with
simpler processes than the ones that performed refactoring using only Eclipse
native features. We were able to find moderate correlations (43%) between
software cyclomatic complexity and process cyclomatic complexity. The best
models found for the refactoring method and cyclomatic complexity level
predictions, had an accuracy of 92.95% and 94.36%, respectively. Conclusions:
Our approach agnostic to programming languages, geographic location, or
development practices. Initial findings are encouraging, and lead us to suggest
practitioners may use our method in other development tasks, such as, defect
analysis and unit or integration tests.

					<dc:title>Evolution of Risk-Taking Behaviour and Status Preferences in
  Anti-Coordination Games</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Staab, Manuel</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - Theoretical Economics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper analyses how risk-taking behaviour and preferences over
consumption rank can emerge as a neutrally stable equilibrium when individuals
face an anti-coordination task. If in an otherwise homogeneous society
information about relative consumption becomes available, this cannot be
ignored. Despite concavity in the objective function, stable types must be
willing to accept risky gambles to differentiate themselves, and thus allow for
coordination. Relative consumption acts as a form of costly communication. This
suggests status preferences to be salient in settings where miscoordination is
particularly costly.

					<dc:description>  Motivated by a problem of optimal harvesting of natural resources, we study a
control problem for Volterra type dynamics driven by time-changed L\'evy
noises, which are in general not Markovian. To exploit the nature of the noise,
we make use of different kind of information flows within a maximum principle
approach. For this we work with backward stochastic differential equations
(BSDE) with time-change and exploit the non-anticipating stochastic derivative
introduced in [15]. We prove both a sufficient and necessary stochastic maximum
principle.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces two sequent calculi for intuitionistic strong L\&quot;ob
logic ${\sf iSL}_\Box$: a terminating sequent calculus ${\sf G4iSL}_\Box$ based
on the terminating sequent calculus ${\sf G4ip}$ for intuitionistic
propositional logic ${\sf IPC}$ and an extension ${\sf G3iSL}_\Box$ of the
standard cut-free sequent calculus ${\sf G3ip}$ without structural rules for
${\sf IPC}$. One of the main results is a syntactic proof of the
cut-elimination theorem for ${\sf G3iSL}_\Box$. In addition, equivalences
between the sequent calculi and Hilbert systems for ${\sf iSL}_\Box$ are
established. It is known from the literature that ${\sf iSL}_\Box$ is complete
with respect to the class of intuitionistic modal Kripke models in which the
modal relation is transitive, conversely well-founded and a subset of the
intuitionistic relation. Here a constructive proof of this fact is obtained by
using a countermodel construction based on a variant of ${\sf G4iSL}_\Box$. The
paper thus contains two proofs of cut-elimination, a semantic and a syntactic
proof.

					<dc:description>  The Suzuki algebra $A_{Nn}^{\mu \lambda}$ was introduced by Suzuki Satoshi in
1998, which is a class of cosemisimple Hopf algebras. It is not categorically
Morita-equivalent to a group algebra in general. In this paper, the author
gives a complete set of simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the Suzuki algebra
$A_{N\,2n}^{\mu\lambda}$ and investigates the Nichols algebras over those
simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules. The involved finite dimensional Nichols
algebras of diagonal type are of Cartan type $A_1$, $A_1\times A_1$, $A_2$,
$A_2\times A_2$, Super type ${\bf A}_{2}(q;I_2)$ and the Nichols algebra
ufo(8). There are $64$, $4m$ and $m^2$-dimensional Nichols algebras of
non-diagonal type over $A_{N\,2n}^{\mu \lambda}$. The $64$-dimensional Nichols
algebras are of dihedral rack type $\Bbb{D}_4$. The $4m$ and $m^2$-dimensional
Nichols algebras $\mathfrak{B}(V_{abe})$ discovered first by Andruskiewitsch
and Giraldi can be realized in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over
$A_{Nn}^{\mu \lambda}$. By using a result of Masuoka, we prove that
$\dim\mathfrak{B}(V_{abe})=\infty$ under the condition $b^2=(ae)^{-1}$,
$b\in\Bbb{G}_{m}$ for $m\geq 5$.

					<dc:description>  Automated red blood cell (RBC) classification on blood smear images helps
hematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,
overlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be
separated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple
classes with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging
because normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper
presents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,
specifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing
on overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates
ellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then
finds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood
smear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.
However, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was
34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of
machine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence
more challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal
with this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,
respectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results
showed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential
to deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,
while data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification
performance.

					<dc:title>Good News Is Not a Sufficient Condition for Motivated Reasoning</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Thaler, Michael</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - General Economics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  People often receive good news that makes them feel better or bad news that
makes them feel worse about the world around them. This paper studies how good
news and bad news affect belief updating. Using two experiments with over 1,500
subjects and 5,500 observations, I test whether people engage in motivated
reasoning to overly trust good news versus bad news on issues such as cancer
survival rates, others' happiness, and infant mortality. The estimate for
motivated reasoning towards good news is a precisely-estimated null. Modest
effects, of one-third the size of motivated reasoning about politics and
self-image, can be ruled out. Complementary survey evidence shows that most
people expect good news to make people happier, but to not lead to motivated
reasoning, suggesting that news that makes people feel better is not sufficient
to lead them to distort belief updating to favor those beliefs.

					<dc:description>  We study a stochastic differential game between two players, controlling a
forward stochastic Volterra integral equation (FSVIE). Each player has to
optimize his own performance functional which includes a backward stochastic
differential equation (BSDE). The dynamics considered are driven by
time-changed L\'evy noises, with absolutely continuous time-change process. We
prove a sufficient maximum principle to characterize Nash equilibria and the
related optimal strategies. For this we use techniques of control under partial
information, and the non-anticipating stochastic derivative. The zero-sum game
is presented as a particular case.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Motivated by the potential for parallel implementation of batch-based
algorithms and the accelerated convergence achievable with approximated second
order information a limited memory version of the BFGS algorithm has been
receiving increasing attention in recent years for large neural network
training problems. As the shape of the cost function is generally not quadratic
and only becomes approximately quadratic in the vicinity of a minimum, the use
of second order information by L-BFGS can be unreliable during the initial
phase of training, i.e. when far from a minimum. Therefore, to control the
influence of second order information as training progresses, we propose a
multi-batch L-BFGS algorithm, namely MB-AM, that gradually increases its trust
in the curvature information by implementing a progressive storage and use of
curvature data through a development-based increase (dev-increase) scheme.
Using six discriminative modelling benchmark problems we show empirically that
MB-AM has slightly faster convergence and, on average, achieves better
solutions than the standard multi-batch L-BFGS algorithm when training MLP and
CNN models.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Reducing dimensionality is a key preprocessing step in many data analysis
applications to address the negative effects of the curse of dimensionality and
collinearity on model performance and computational complexity, to denoise the
data or to reduce storage requirements. Moreover, in many applications it is
desirable to reduce the input dimensions by choosing a subset of variables that
best represents the entire set without any a priori information available.
Unsupervised variable selection techniques provide a solution to this second
problem. An autoencoder, if properly regularized, can solve both unsupervised
dimensionality reduction and variable selection, but the training of large
neural networks can be prohibitive in time sensitive applications. We present
an approach called Recovery of Linear Components (RLC), which serves as a
middle ground between linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction
techniques, reducing autoencoder training times while enhancing performance
over purely linear techniques. With the aid of synthetic and real world case
studies, we show that the RLC, when compared with an autoencoder of similar
complexity, shows higher accuracy, similar robustness to overfitting, and
faster training times. Additionally, at the cost of a relatively small increase
in computational complexity, RLC is shown to outperform the current
state-of-the-art for a semiconductor manufacturing wafer measurement site
optimization application.

goal: the first is to identify the main code smells detection techniques and
tools discussed in the literature, and the second is to analyze to which extent
visual techniques have been applied to support the former. Method: Over 83
primary studies indexed in major scientific repositories were identified by our
search string in this SLR. Then, following existing best practices for
secondary studies, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the most
relevant works, extract their features and classify them. Results: We found
that the most commonly used approaches to code smells detection are
search-based (30.1%), and metric-based (24.1%). Most of the studies (83.1%) use
open-source software, with the Java language occupying the first position
(77.1%). In terms of code smells, God Class (51.8%), Feature Envy (33.7%), and
Long Method (26.5%) are the most covered ones. Machine learning techniques are
used in 35% of the studies. Around 80% of the studies only detect code smells,
without providing visualization techniques. In visualization-based approaches
several methods are used, such as: city metaphors, 3D visualization techniques.
Conclusions: We confirm that the detection of CS is a non trivial task, and
there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of: reducing the subjectivity
associated with the definition and detection of CS; increasing the diversity of
detected CS and of supported programming languages; constructing and sharing
oracles and datasets to facilitate the replication of CS detection and
visualization techniques validation experiments.

					<dc:description>  Using machine learning, we explore the utility of various deep neural
networks (NN) when applied to high harmonic generation (HHG) scenarios. First,
we train the NNs to predict the time-dependent dipole and spectra of HHG
emission from reduced-dimensionality models of di- and triatomic systems based
of on sets of randomly generated parameters (laser pulse intensity,
internuclear distance, and molecular orientation). These networks, once
trained, are useful tools to rapidly generate the HHG spectra of our systems.
Similarly, we have trained the NNs to solve the inverse problem - to determine
the molecular parameters based on HHG spectra or dipole acceleration data.
These types of networks could then be used as spectroscopic tools to invert HHG
spectra in order to recover the underlying physical parameters of a system.
Next, we demonstrate that transfer learning can be applied to our networks to
expand the range of applicability of the networks with only a small number of
new test cases added to our training sets. Finally, we demonstrate NNs that can
be used to classify molecules by type: di- or triatomic, symmetric or
asymmetric, wherein we can even rely on fairly simple fully connected neural
networks. With outlooks toward training with experimental data, these NN
topologies offer a novel set of spectroscopic tools that could be incorporated
into HHG experiments.

					<dc:description>  The permutation group $S_N$ has a quantum analogue $S_N^+$, which is infinite

and its consequences. We discuss then the structure of the closed subgroups
$G\subset S_N^+$, and notably of the quantum symmetry groups of finite graphs
$G^+(X)\subset S_N^+$, with particular attention to the quantum reflection
groups $H_N^{s+}$. We also discuss, more generally, the quantum symmetry groups
$S_F^+$ of the finite quantum spaces $F$, and their closed subgroups $G\subset
S_F^+$, with particular attention to the quantum graph case, and to quantum
reflection groups.

					<dc:description>  Code smells are seen as major source of technical debt and, as such, should
be detected and removed. However, researchers argue that the subjectiveness of
the code smells detection process is a major hindrance to mitigate the problem
of smells-infected code. We proposed the crowdsmelling approach based on
supervised machine learning techniques, where the wisdom of the crowd (of
software developers) is used to collectively calibrate code smells detection
algorithms, thereby lessening the subjectivity issue. This paper presents the
results of a validation experiment for the crowdsmelling approach. In the
context of three consecutive years of a Software Engineering course, a total
&quot;crowd&quot; of around a hundred teams, with an average of three members each,
classified the presence of 3 code smells (Long Method, God Class, and Feature
Envy) in Java source code. These classifications were the basis of the oracles
used for training six machine learning algorithms. Over one hundred models were
generated and evaluated to determine which machine learning algorithms had the
best performance in detecting each of the aforementioned code smells. Good
performances were obtained for God Class detection (ROC=0.896 for Naive Bayes)
and Long Method detection (ROC=0.870 for AdaBoostM1), but much lower for
Feature Envy (ROC=0.570 for Random Forrest). Obtained results suggest that
crowdsmelling is a feasible approach for the detection of code smells, but
further validation experiments are required to cover more code smells and to
increase external validity.

					<dc:description>  A proof of work (PoW) is an important cryptographic construct enabling a
party to convince others that they invested some effort in solving a
computational task. Arguably, its main impact has been in the setting of
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain protocol, which
received significant attention in recent years due to its potential for various
applications as well as for solving fundamental distributed computing questions
in novel threat models. PoWs enable the linking of blocks in the blockchain
data structure and thus the problem of interest is the feasibility of obtaining
a sequence (chain) of such proofs. In this work, we examine the hardness of
finding such chain of PoWs against quantum strategies. We prove that the chain
of PoWs problem reduces to a problem we call multi-solution Bernoulli search,
for which we establish its quantum query complexity. Effectively, this is an
extension of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured
search problem. Our proof, adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and
generalizes the recording technique of Zhandry (Crypto'19). As an application,
we revisit the formal treatment of security of the core of the Bitcoin
consensus protocol, the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt'15), against quantum
adversaries, while honest parties are classical and show that protocol's
security holds under a quantum analogue of the classical ``honest majority''
assumption. Our analysis indicates that the security of Bitcoin backbone is
guaranteed provided the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so
that each quantum query is worth $O(p^{-1/2})$ classical ones, where $p$ is the
success probability of a single classical query to the protocol's underlying
hash function. Somewhat surprisingly, the wait time for safe settlement in the
case of quantum adversaries matches the safe settlement time in the classical
case.

					<dc:title>PHP code smells in web apps: survival and anomalies</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Rio, Am&#xe9;rico</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Abreu, Fernando Brito e</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  Context: Code smells are considered symptoms of poor design, leading to
future problems, such as reduced maintainability. Except for anecdotal cases
(e. g. code dropout), a code smell survives until it gets explicitly refactored
or removed. This paper presents a longitudinal study on the survival of code
smells for web apps built with PHP.
  Objectives: RQ: (i) code smells survival depends on their scope? (ii)
practitioners attitudes towards code smells removal in web apps have changed
throughout time? (iii) how long code smells survive in web applications? (iv)
are there sudden variations (anomalies) in the density of code smells through
the evolution of web apps?
  Method: We analyze the evolution of 6 code smells in 8 web applications
written in PHP at the server side, across several years, using the survival
analysis technique. We classify code smells according to scope in two
categories: scattered and localized. Scattered code smells are expected to be
more harmful since their influence is not circumscribed as in localized code
smells. We split the observations for each web app into two equal and
consecutive timeframes, to test the hypothesis that code smells awareness has
increased throughout time. As for the anomalies, we standardize their detection
criteria.
  Results: We present some evidence that code smells survival depends on their
scope: the average survival rate decreases in some of them, while the opposite
is observed for the remainder. The survival of localized code smells is around
4 years, while the scattered ones live around 5 years. Around 60% of the smells
are removed, and some live through all the application life. We also show how a
graphical representation of anomalies found in the evolution of code smells
allows unveiling the story of a development project and make managers aware of
the need for enforcing regular refactoring practices.

					<dc:description>  Clinical sleep analysis require manual analysis of sleep patterns for correct
diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, several studies have shown significant
variability in manual scoring of clinically relevant discrete sleep events,
such as arousals, leg movements, and sleep disordered breathing (apneas and
hypopneas). We investigated whether an automatic method could be used for event
detection and if a model trained on all events (joint model) performed better
than corresponding event-specific models (single-event models). We trained a
deep neural network event detection model on 1653 individual recordings and
tested the optimized model on 1000 separate hold-out recordings. F1 scores for
the optimized joint detection model were 0.70, 0.63, and 0.62 for arousals, leg
movements, and sleep disordered breathing, respectively, compared to 0.65,
0.61, and 0.60 for the optimized single-event models. Index values computed
from detected events correlated positively with manual annotations ($r^2$ =
0.73, $r^2$ = 0.77, $r^2$ = 0.78, respectively). We furthermore quantified
model accuracy based on temporal difference metrics, which improved overall by
using the joint model compared to single-event models. Our automatic model
jointly detects arousals, leg movements and sleep disordered breathing events
with high correlation with human annotations. Finally, we benchmark against
previous state-of-the-art multi-event detection models and found an overall
increase in F1 score with our proposed model despite a 97.5% reduction in model
size. Source code for training and inference is available at
https://github.com/neergaard/msed.git.

					<dc:description>  Differential evolution (DE) is an effective global evolutionary optimization
algorithm using to solve global optimization problems mainly in a continuous
domain. In this field, researchers pay more attention to improving the
capability of DE to find better global solutions, however, the computational
performance of DE is also a very interesting aspect especially when the problem
scale is quite large. Firstly, this paper analyzes the design of parallel
computation of DE which can easily be executed in Math Kernel Library (MKL) and
Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Then the essence of the exponential
crossover operator is described and we point out that it cannot be used for
better parallel computation. Later, we propose a new exponential crossover
operator (NEC) that can be executed parallelly with MKL/CUDA. Next, the
extended experiments show that the new crossover operator can speed up DE
greatly. In the end, we test the new parallel DE structure, illustrating that
the former is much faster.

					<dc:description>  We study parabolic reductions and Newton points of G-bundles on the
Fargues-Fontaine curve and the Newton stratification on the
$B_{dR}^+$-Grassmannian for any reductive group G. Let $Bun_G$ be the stack of
G-bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Our first main result is to show that
under the identification of the points of $Bun_G$ with Kottwitz's set B(G), the
closure relations on the topological space $|Bun_G|$ coincide with the opposite
of the usual partial order on B(G). Furthermore, we prove that every
non-Hodge-Newton decomposable Newton stratum in a minuscule affine Schubert
cell in the $B_{dR}^+$-Grassmannian intersects the weakly admissible locus,
proving a conjecture of Chen. On the way, we study several interesting
properties of parabolic reductions of $G$-bundles, and determine which Newton
strata have classical points.

					<dc:description>  The emergence of quasiparticles is a universal property in integrable
systems. String-type quasiparticles, which are characterized by the string
solutions of Bethe equations, play fundamental roles in the analysis of their
physics. Through an investigation of the Bethe equations in the asymmetric
simple exclusion process, we reveal the existence of string solutions in the
presence of non-Hermiticity resulting from asymmetrical hopping. Because of the
non-Hermiticity, the string solutions exhibit exotic properties such as the
complexification of the center of string solutions and the delocalization of
Bethe quantum numbers. In addition, we find the picture of string-type
quasiparticles collapses in the strong asymmetry regime. The collapse of string
solutions characterizes the transition of eigenstates from bound states to
scattering states.

					<dc:description>  In Bayesian peer-to-peer decentralized data fusion, the underlying
distributions held locally by autonomous agents are frequently assumed to be
over the same set of variables (homogeneous). This requires each agent to
process and communicate the full global joint distribution, and thus leads to
high computation and communication costs irrespective of relevancy to specific
local objectives. This work formulates and studies heterogeneous decentralized
fusion problems, defined as the set of problems in which either the
communicated or the processed distributions describe different, but
overlapping, random states of interest that are subsets of a larger full global
joint state. We exploit the conditional independence structure of such problems
and provide a rigorous derivation of novel exact and approximate conditionally
factorized heterogeneous fusion rules. We further develop a new version of the
homogeneous Channel Filter algorithm to enable conservative heterogeneous
fusion for smoothing and filtering scenarios in dynamic problems. Numerical
examples show more than $99.5\%$ potential communication reduction for
heterogeneous channel filter fusion, and a multi-target tracking simulation
shows that these methods provide consistent estimates while remaining
computationally scalable.

					<dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fragile to small perturbations in
the input images. These networks are thus prone to malicious attacks that
perturb the inputs to force a misclassification. Such slightly manipulated
images aimed at deceiving the classifier are known as adversarial images. In
this work, we investigate statistical differences between natural images and
adversarial ones. More precisely, we show that employing a proper image
transformation and for a class of adversarial attacks, the distribution of the
leading digit of the pixels in adversarial images deviates from Benford's law.
The stronger the attack, the more distant the resulting distribution is from
Benford's law. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of this new
approach that can serve as a basis for alternative adversarial example
detection methods that do not need to modify the original CNN classifier
neither work on the raw high-dimensional pixels as features to defend against
attacks.

					<dc:description>  It is shown that for the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator with potential
$V(x)= a x^2 + b g x^3 +\ldots=\frac{1}{g^2}\,\hat{V}(gx)$, as well as for the
radial oscillator $V(r)=\frac{1}{g^2}\,\hat{V}(gr)$ and for the perturbed
Coulomb problem $V(r)=\frac{\alpha}{r}+ \beta g r + \ldots = g\,\tilde{V}(gr)$,
the Perturbation Theory in powers of the coupling constant $g$ (weak coupling
regime) and the semiclassical expansion in powers of $\hbar^{1/2}$ for the
energies coincide. This is related to the fact that the dynamics developed in
two spaces: $x\ (r)$-space and $gx\ (gr)$-space, lead to the same energy
spectra. The equations which govern dynamics in these two spaces, the
Riccati-Bloch equation and the Generalized Bloch equation, respectively, are
presented. It is shown that the perturbation theory for the logarithmic
derivative of the wavefunction in $gx\ (gr)$- space leads to (true)
semiclassical expansion in powers of $\hbar^{1/2}$; for the one-dimensional
case this corresponds to the flucton calculus for the density matrix in the
path integral formalism in Euclidean (imaginary) time proposed by one of the
authors, Shuryak(1988). Matching the perturbation theory in powers of $g$ and
the semiclassical expansion in powers of $\hbar^{1/2}$ for the wavefunction
leads to a highly accurate local approximation in the entire coordinate space,
its expectation value for the Hamiltonian provides a prescription for the
summation of the perturbative (trans)-series.

					<dc:description>  It is common to use networks to encode the architecture of interactions
between entities in complex systems in the physical, biological, social, and
information sciences. To study the large-scale behavior of complex systems, it
is useful to examine mesoscale structures in networks as building blocks that
influence such behavior. We present a new approach for describing low-rank
mesoscale structures in networks, and we illustrate our approach using several
synthetic network models and empirical friendship, collaboration, and
protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We find that these networks
possess a relatively small number of `latent motifs' that together can
successfully approximate most subgraphs of a network at a fixed mesoscale. We
use an algorithm for `network dictionary learning' (NDL), which combines a
network-sampling method and nonnegative matrix factorization, to learn the
latent motifs of a given network. The ability to encode a network using a set
of latent motifs has a wide variety of applications to network-analysis tasks,
such as comparison, denoising, and edge inference. Additionally, using a new
network denoising and reconstruction (NDR) algorithm, we demonstrate how to
denoise a corrupted network by using only the latent motifs that one learns
directly from the corrupted network.

					<dc:description>  In order to provide differential privacy, Gaussian noise with standard
deviation $\sigma$ is added to local SGD updates after performing a clipping
operation in Differential Private SGD (DP-SGD). By non-trivially improving the
account method we prove a simple and easy to evaluate closed form
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee: DP-SGD is $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP if
$\sigma=\sqrt{2(\epsilon +\ln(1/\delta))/\epsilon}$ and $T$ is at least
$\approx 2k^2/\epsilon$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $K=kN$ is
the total number of gradient computations where $k$ measures $K$ in number of
epochs of size $N$ of the local data set. We prove that our expression is close
to tight in that if $T$ is more than a constant factor $\approx 8$ smaller than
the lower bound $\approx 2k^2/\epsilon$, then the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP
guarantee is violated. Choosing the smallest possible value $T\approx
2k^2/\epsilon$ not only leads to a close to tight DP guarantee, but also
minimizes the total number of communicated updates and this means that the
least amount of noise is aggregated into the global model and accuracy is
optimized as confirmed by simulations. In addition this minimizes round
communication.

					<dc:description>  Identifying a low-dimensional informed parameter subspace offers a viable
path to alleviating the dimensionality challenge in the sampled-based solution
to large-scale Bayesian inverse problems. This paper introduces a novel
gradient-based dimension reduction method in which the informed subspace does
not depend on the data. This permits an online-offline computational strategy
where the expensive low-dimensional structure of the problem is detected in an
offline phase, meaning before observing the data. This strategy is particularly
relevant for multiple inversion problems as the same informed subspace can be
reused. The proposed approach allows controlling the approximation error (in
expectation over the data) of the posterior distribution. We also present
sampling strategies that exploit the informed subspace to draw efficiently
samples from the exact posterior distribution. The method is successfully
illustrated on two numerical examples: a PDE-based inverse problem with a
Gaussian process prior and a tomography problem with Poisson data and a
Besov-$\mathcal{B}^2_{11}$ prior.

					<dc:description>  Calibrating a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model against data leads
to an improvement. Determining {\it a priori} if such an improvement
generalizes to flows outside the calibration data is an outstanding challenge.
This work attempts to address this challenge via global epistemic Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ). Unlike the available epistemic UQ methods that are local
and tell us a model's uncertainty at one specific flow condition, the global
epistemic UQ method presented in this work tells us also whether a perturbation
of the original model would generalize. Specifically, the global epistemic UQ
method evaluates a potential improvement in terms of its &quot;effectiveness&quot; and
&quot;inconsistency&quot;. Any improvement can be put in one of the following four
quadrants: first, high effectiveness, low inconsistency; second, high
effectiveness, high inconsistency; third, low effectiveness, low inconsistency;
and fourth, low effectiveness, high inconsistency. An improvement would
generalize if and only if it is in the high effectiveness and low inconsistency
quadrant. To demonstrate the concept, we apply the global epistemic UQ to full
Reynolds stress modeling of a stratified shear layer. The global epistemic UQ
results point to a model coefficient in the pressure-strain correlation closure
(among others) as effective and consistent for predicting the quantity of
interest of shear layer's growth. We calibrate the model coefficient such that
our RANS matches direct numerical simulation data at one flow condition. We
show that the calibrated model generalizes to several other test flow
conditions. On the other hand, when calibrating a high inconsistency term, we
get a model that works at only the calibrated condition.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a chance constrained stochastic model predictive
control scheme for reference tracking of distributed linear time-invariant
systems with additive stochastic uncertainty. The chance constraints are
reformulated analytically based on mean-variance information, where we design
suitable Probabilistic Reachable Sets for constraint tightening. Furthermore,
the chance constraints are proven to be satisfied in closed-loop operation. The
design of an invariant set for tracking complements the controller and ensures
convergence to arbitrary admissible reference points, while a conditional
initialization scheme provides the fundamental property of recursive
feasibility. The paper closes with a numerical example, highlighting the
convergence to changing output references and empirical constraint
satisfaction.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Recent studies
about adversarial robustness focus on the loss landscape in the parameter space
since it is related to optimization and generalization performance. These
studies conclude that the difficulty of adversarial training is caused by the
non-smoothness of the loss function: i.e., its gradient is not Lipschitz
continuous. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial
attacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for
models, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we
analyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the
optimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the
constraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that
the smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the
$L_\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.
Moreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with
respect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial
loss tends to increase. To address the non-smoothness, we show that EntropySGD
smoothens the non-smooth loss and improves the performance of adversarial
training.

condition for sustainable development as they are the constituents of any
manufacturing product. To enhance the efficiency of material management, we
define a computer-vision-enabled material measurement system and provide a
review of works relevant to its development with particular emphasis on the
foundations. A network of such systems for wide-area material stock monitoring
is also covered. Finally, challenges and future research directions are
discussed. As the first article bridging industrial ecology and advanced
computer vision, this review is intended to support both research communities

					<dc:description>  We study random joint choice rules, allowing for interdependence of choice
across agents. These capture random choice by multiple agents, or a single
agent across goods or time periods. Our interest is in separable choice rules,
where each agent can be thought of as acting independently of the other. A
random joint choice rule satisfies marginality if for every individual choice
set, we can determine the individual's choice probabilities over alternatives
independently of the other individual's choice set. We offer two
characterizations of random joint choice rules satisfying marginality in terms
of separable choice rules. While marginality is a necessary condition for
separability, we show that it fails to be sufficient. We provide an additional
condition on the marginal choice rules which, along with marginality, is
sufficient for separability.

					<dc:description>  Classification performance based on ImageNet is the de-facto standard metric
for CNN development. In this work we challenge the notion that CNN architecture
design solely based on ImageNet leads to generally effective convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures that perform well on a diverse set of
datasets and application domains. To this end, we investigate and ultimately
improve ImageNet as a basis for deriving such architectures. We conduct an
extensive empirical study for which we train $500$ CNN architectures, sampled
from the broad AnyNetX design space, on ImageNet as well as $8$ additional well
known image classification benchmark datasets from a diverse array of
application domains. We observe that the performances of the architectures are
highly dataset dependent. Some datasets even exhibit a negative error
correlation with ImageNet across all architectures. We show how to
significantly increase these correlations by utilizing ImageNet subsets
restricted to fewer classes. These contributions can have a profound impact on
the way we design future CNN architectures and help alleviate the tilt we see
currently in our community with respect to over-reliance on one dataset.

					<dc:description>  Conventional breast cancer imaging techniques are nowadays based on the use
of ionising radiations or ultrasound waves for the inspection of breast areas.
Nevertheless, these conventional techniques present some drawbacks related to
patient safety, processing time and resolution issues. In this framework,
microwave imaging can represent a valid alternative or a complementary
technique compared to other conventional medical imaging modalities since it is
safe (using non-ionising radiations), relatively cheap and more comfortable
from patient point of view. Unfortunately, it is slow and computationally
expensive, which strongly limit its use in clinical scenarios. In this paper,
an artificial neural network for effective and almost real-time breast imaging
is proposed. First, a realistic breast-like phantom generator was developed for
training the network. Subsequently, numerical analyses have been conducted for
the optimisation and the performance evaluation of the approach. The results
seem very promising in terms of recovery performance as well as for the
computation burden.

					<dc:description>  Lowering the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) can greatly reduce
the potential risk to public health. However, the reconstructed images from the
dose-reduced CT or low-dose CT (LDCT) suffer from severe noise, compromising
the subsequent diagnosis and analysis. Recently, convolutional neural networks
have achieved promising results in removing noise from LDCT images; the network
architectures used are either handcrafted or built on top of conventional
networks such as ResNet and U-Net. Recent advance on neural network
architecture search (NAS) has proved that the network architecture has a
dramatic effect on the model performance, which indicates that current network
architectures for LDCT may be sub-optimal. Therefore, in this paper, we make
the first attempt to apply NAS to LDCT and propose a multi-scale and
multi-level NAS for LDCT denoising, termed MANAS. On the one hand, the proposed
MANAS fuses features extracted by different scale cells to capture multi-scale
image structural details. On the other hand, the proposed MANAS can search a
hybrid cell- and network-level structure for better performance. Extensively
experimental results on three different dose levels demonstrate that the
proposed MANAS can achieve better performance in terms of preserving image
structural details than several state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also
validate the effectiveness of the multi-scale and multi-level architecture for
LDCT denoising.

					<dc:description>  We propose a policy search approach to learn controllers from specifications
given as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. The system model, which is
unknown but assumed to be an affine control system, is learned together with
the control policy. The model is implemented as two feedforward neural networks
(FNNs) - one for the drift, and one for the control directions. To capture the
history dependency of STL specifications, we use a recurrent neural network
(RNN) to implement the control policy. In contrast to prevalent model-free
methods, the learning approach proposed here takes advantage of the learned
model and is more efficient. We use control barrier functions (CBFs) with the
learned model to improve the safety of the system. We validate our algorithm
via simulations and experiments. The results show that our approach can satisfy
the given specification within very few system runs, and can be used for
on-line control.

					<dc:description>  In the current pilot study, we attempt to find out how double neurofeedback
influences functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity. We examined 30
healthy participants (8 males; 22 females, mean age = 29; SD= 8). To measure
functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity, we used computer laterometry in
the 'two-source' lead-lag dichotic paradigm. Double biofeedback included 8
minutes of EEG oscillation recording with five minutes of basic mode. During
the basic mode, the current amplitude of the EEG oscillator gets transformed
into feedback sounds while the current amplitude of alpha EEG oscillator is
used to modulate the intensity of light signals. Double neurofeedback did not
directly influence the asymmetry itself but accelerated individual sound
perception characteristics during dichotic listening in the preceding effect
paradigm. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of double
neurofeedback training on functional brain activity and asymmetry taking into
account participants' age, gender, and motivation.

					<dc:description>  Given an infinite word over the alphabet $\{0,1,2,3\}$, we define a class of
bipartite hereditary graphs $\mathcal{G}^\alpha$, and show that
$\mathcal{G}^\alpha$ has unbounded clique-width unless $\alpha$ contains at
most finitely many non-zero letters.
  We also show that $\mathcal{G}^\alpha$ is minimal of unbounded clique-width
if and only if $\alpha$ belongs to a precisely defined collection of words
$\Gamma$. The set $\Gamma$ includes all almost periodic words containing at
least one non-zero letter, which both enables us to exhibit uncountably many
pairwise distinct minimal classes of unbounded clique width, and also proves
one direction of a conjecture due to Collins, Foniok, Korpelainen, Lozin and
Zamaraev. Finally, we show that the other direction of the conjecture is false,
since $\Gamma$ also contains words that are \emph{not} almost periodic.

					<dc:description>  Distribution-free tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test are popular for
testing the equality of two univariate distributions. Among the important
reasons for their popularity are the striking results of Hodges-Lehmann (1956)
and Chernoff-Savage (1958), where the authors show that the asymptotic (Pitman)
relative efficiency of Wilcoxon's test with respect to Student's $t$-test,
under location-shift alternatives, never falls below $0.864$ (with the identity
score) and $1$ (with the Gaussian score) respectively, despite the former being
exactly distribution-free for all sample sizes. Motivated by these results, we
propose and study a large family of exactly distribution-free multivariate
rank-based two-sample tests by leveraging the theory of optimal transport.
First, we propose distribution-free analogs of the Hotelling $T^2$ test (the
natural multidimensional counterpart of Student's $t$-test) and show that they
satisfy Hodges-Lehmann and Chernoff-Savage-type efficiency lower bounds over
natural sub-families of multivariate distributions, despite being entirely
agnostic to the underlying data generating mechanism -- making them the first
multivariate, nonparametric, exactly distribution-free tests that provably
achieve such efficiency lower bounds. As these tests are derived from Hotelling
$T^2$, naturally they are not universally consistent (same as Wilcoxon's test).
To overcome this, we propose exactly distribution-free versions of the
celebrated kernel maximum mean discrepancy test and the energy test. These
tests are indeed universally consistent under no moment assumptions, exactly
distribution-free for all sample sizes, and have non-trivial Pitman efficiency.
We believe this trifecta of properties hasn't yet been proven for any existing
test in the literature.

We establish a generalization to relations of any arity and dimension,
definable in: 1) stable structures with distal expansions (includes
algebraically and differentially closed fields of characteristic $0$); and 2)
$o$-minimal expansions of groups. Our methods provide explicit bounds on the

a higher arity generalization of the abelian group configuration theorem in

Latin hypercubes that arise from abelian groups; and Zarankiewicz-style bounds
for hypergraphs definable in distal structures.

					<dc:description>  This paper is interested in independent sets (or equivalently, cliques) in
uniform random cographs. We also study their permutation analogs, namely,
increasing subsequences in uniform random separable permutations.
  First, we prove that, with high probability as $n$ gets large, the largest
independent set in a uniform random cograph with $n$ vertices has size $o(n)$.
This answers a question of Kang, McDiarmid, Reed and Scott. Using the
connection between graphs and permutations via inversion graphs, we also give a
similar result for the longest increasing subsequence in separable
permutations. These results are proved using the self-similarity of the
Brownian limits of random cographs and random separable permutations, and
actually apply more generally to all families of graphs and permutations with
the same limit.
  Second, and unexpectedly given the above results, we show that for $\beta &gt;0$
sufficiently small, the expected number of independent sets of size $\beta n$
in a uniform random cograph with $n$ vertices grows exponentially fast with
$n$. We also prove a permutation analog of this result. This time the proofs
rely on singularity analysis of the associated bivariate generating functions.

					<dc:title>Generating isospectral but not isomorphic quantum graphs</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Pistol, Mats-Erik</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Spectral Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Quantum graphs are defined by having a Laplacian defined on the edges a
metric graph with boundary conditions on each vertex such that the resulting
operator, $\mathbf{L}$, is self-adjoint. We use Neumann boundary conditions.
The spectrum of $\mathbf{L}$ does not determine the graph uniquely, that is,
there exist non-isomorphic graphs with the same spectra. There are few known
examples of pairs of non-isomorphic but isospectral quantum graphs. In this
paper we rectify this situation by finding hundreds of isospectral sets, using
computer algebra.
  We have found all sets of isospectral but non-isomorphic equilateral
connected quantum graphs with at most nine vertices. This includes thirteen
isospectral triplets and one isospectral set of four. One of the isospectral
triplets involves a loop where we could prove isospectrality. We also present
several different combinatorial methods to generate arbitrarily large sets of
isospectral graphs, including infinite graphs in different dimensions. As part
of this we have found a method to determine if two vertices have the same
Titchmarsh-Weil $M$-function. We give combinatorial methods to generate sets of
graphs with arbitrarily large number of vertices with the same $M$-function. We
discuss the possibilities that our program is incorrect, present our tests and
open source it for inspection at http://github.com/meapistol/Spectra-of-graphs.
</dc:description>
					<dc:description>Comment: 50 pages, 35 figures. Typos corrected. This is a major revision where
  the text has been crispified by extensive use of $M$-functions. For most
  graphs we now show if they have vertices with the same $M$-functions. We will
  generate secular determinants on reasonable requests for the community</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Deflection of light due to spheroidal oblate static objects</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Brahma, Ranchhaigiri</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Sen, A. K.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Deflection of light due to massive objects was predicted by Einstein in his
General Theory of Relativity. This deflection of light has been calculated by
many researchers in past, for spherically symmetric objects. But, in reality,
most of these gravitating objects are not spherical instead they are
ellipsoidal ( oblate) in shape. The objective of the present work is to study
theoretically the effect of this ellipticity on the trajectory of a light ray.
Here, we obtain a converging series expression for the deflection of a light
ray due to an ellipsoidal gravitating object, characterised by an ellipticity
parameter. As a boundary condition, by setting the ellipticity parameter to be
equal to zero, we get back the same expression for deflection as due to
Schwarzschild object. It is also found that the additional contribution in
deflection angle due to this ellipticity though small, but could be typically
higher than the similar contribution caused by the rotation of a celestial
object. Therefore for a precise estimate of the deflection due to a celestial
object, the calculations presented here would be useful.

					<dc:description>  Recommender systems are facing scrutiny because of their growing impact on
the opportunities we have access to. Current audits for fairness are limited to
coarse-grained parity assessments at the level of sensitive groups. We propose
to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual
preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other
users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users
beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure
exploration problem in multi-armed bandits. We propose a sample-efficient
algorithm with theoretical guarantees that it does not deteriorate user
experience. We also study the trade-offs achieved on real-world recommendation
datasets.

					<dc:description>  We consider sequential hypothesis testing between two quantum states using
adaptive and non-adaptive strategies. In this setting, samples of an unknown
state are requested sequentially and a decision to either continue or to accept
one of the two hypotheses is made after each test. Under the constraint that
the number of samples is bounded, either in expectation or with high
probability, we exhibit adaptive strategies that minimize both types of
misidentification errors. Namely, we show that these errors decrease
exponentially (in the stopping time) with decay rates given by the measured
relative entropies between the two states. Moreover, if we allow joint
measurements on multiple samples, the rates are increased to the respective
quantum relative entropies. We also fully characterize the achievable error
exponents for non-adaptive strategies and provide numerical evidence showing
that adaptive measurements are necessary to achieve our bounds under some
additional assumptions.

					<dc:description>  Trust between team members is an essential requirement for any successful
cooperation. Thus, engendering and maintaining the fellow team members' trust
becomes a central responsibility for any member trying to not only successfully
participate in the task but to ensure the team achieves its goals. The problem
of trust management is particularly challenging in mixed human-robot teams
where the human and the robot may have different models about the task at hand
and thus may have different expectations regarding the current course of
action, thereby forcing the robot to focus on the costly explicable behavior.
We propose a computational model for capturing and modulating trust in such
iterated human-robot interaction settings, where the human adopts a supervisory
role. In our model, the robot integrates human's trust and their expectations
about the robot into its planning process to build and maintain trust over the
interaction horizon. By establishing the required level of trust, the robot can
focus on maximizing the team goal by eschewing explicit explanatory or
explicable behavior without worrying about the human supervisor monitoring and
intervening to stop behaviors they may not necessarily understand. We model
this reasoning about trust levels as a meta reasoning process over individual
planning tasks. We additionally validate our model through a human subject
experiment.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Geometric Topology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We construct a braided monoidal functor $J_4$ from Bobtcheva and
Piergallini's category $4\mathrm{HB}$ of connected 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies
(up to 2-deformations) to an arbitrary unimodular ribbon category
$\mathcal{C}$, which is not required to be semisimple. The main example of
target category is provided by $H$-mod, the category of left modules over a
unimodular ribbon Hopf algebra $H$. The source category $4\mathrm{HB}$ is
freely generated, as a braided monoidal category, by a BPH algebra (short for
Bobtcheva-Piergallini Hopf algebra), and this is sent by the Kerler-Lyubashenko
functor $J_4$ to the end $\int_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X \otimes X^*$ in
$\mathcal{C}$, which is given by the adjoint representation in the case of
$H$-mod. When $\mathcal{C}$ is factorizable, we show that the construction only
depends on the boundary and signature of handlebodies, and thus projects to a
functor $J_3^\sigma$ defined on Kerler's category $3\mathrm{Cob}^\sigma$ of
connected framed 3-dimensional cobordisms. When $H^*$ is not semisimple and $H$
is not factorizable, our functor $J_4$ has the potential of detecting
diffeomorphisms that are not 2-deformations.

					<dc:description>  While AI has benefited humans, it may also harm humans if not appropriately
developed. The focus of HCI work is transiting from conventional human
interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We
conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current
work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis
highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges
that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach
in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human
interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when
developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of
the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific
HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals in addressing these new
issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of
these methods in support of developing AI systems. We propose alternative
methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI
professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also
offer strategic recommendations for HCI professionals to effectively influence
the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing
HCAI systems.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We consider the natural problem of learning a ReLU network from queries,
which was recently remotivated by model extraction attacks. In this work, we
present a polynomial-time algorithm that can learn a depth-two ReLU network
from queries under mild general position assumptions. We also present a
polynomial-time algorithm that, under mild general position assumptions, can
learn a rich class of depth-three ReLU networks from queries. For instance, it
can learn most networks where the number of first layer neurons is smaller than
the dimension and the number of second layer neurons. These two results
substantially improve state-of-the-art: Until our work, polynomial-time
algorithms were only shown to learn from queries depth-two networks under the
assumption that either the underlying distribution is Gaussian (Chen et al.
(2021)) or that the weights matrix rows are linearly independent (Milli et al.
(2019)). For depth three or more, there were no known poly-time results.

rule is a way to colour the space with $C$ such that the colours allowed for a

$X\times C^k$ with values in $C$. A function $f: X\rightarrow C$ satisfies the
rule at $x$ if $f(x) \in F( x, f(g_1 x), \dots , f(g_k x))$. A colouring rule
is paradoxical if it can be satisfied in some way almost everywhere with
respect to $m$, but not in {\bf any} way that is measurable with respect to a
finitely additive measure that extends the probability measure $m$ and for
which the finitely many transformations $g_1, \dots , g_k$ remain measure
preserving. We show that a colouring rule can be paradoxical when the $g_1,
\dots, g_k$ are members of a group $G$, the probability space $X$ and the
colour set $C$ are compact sets, $C$ is convex and finite dimensional, and the
colouring rule says if $c: X\rightarrow C$ is the colouring function then the
colour $c(x)$ must lie ($m$ a.e.) in $F(x, c(g_1(x) ), \dots , c(g_k(x)))$ for
a non-empty upper-semi-continuous convex-valued correspondence $F$ defined on
$X\times C^k$. We show that any colouring that approximates the correspondence
by $\epsilon$ for small enough positive $\epsilon$ cannot be measurable in the
same finitely additive way. Furthermore any function satisfying the colouring
rule illustrates a paradox through finitely many measure preserving shifts
defining injective maps from the whole space to subsets of measure summing up
to less than one.

					<dc:description>  The main results of the article are short time estimates and asymptotic
estimates for the first two order derivatives of the logarithmic heat kernel of
a complete Riemannian manifold. We remove all curvature restrictions and also
develop several techniques.
  A basic tool developed here is intrinsic stochastic variations with
prescribed second order covariant differentials, allowing to obtain a path
integration representation for the second order derivatives of the heat
semigroup $P_t$ on a complete Riemannian manifold, again without any
assumptions on the curvature. The novelty is the introduction of an
$\epsilon^2$ term in the variation allowing greater control. We also construct
a family of cut-off stochastic processes adapted to an exhaustion by compact
subsets with smooth boundaries, each process is constructed path by path and
differentiable in time, furthermore the differentials have locally uniformly
bounded moments with respect to the Brownian motion measures, allowing to
by-pass the lack of continuity of the exit time of the Brownian motions on its
initial position.

					<dc:description>  We propose a generic variance-reduced algorithm, which we call MUltiple
RANdomized Algorithm (MURANA), for minimizing a sum of several smooth functions
plus a regularizer, in a sequential or distributed manner. Our method is
formulated with general stochastic operators, which allow us to model various
strategies for reducing the computational complexity. For example, MURANA
supports sparse activation of the gradients, and also reduction of the
communication load via compression of the update vectors. This versatility
allows MURANA to cover many existing randomization mechanisms within a unified
framework, which also makes it possible to design new methods as special cases.

					<dc:description>  Schemas are knowledge structures that can enable one-shot learning. Rodent
one-shot learning in a multiple paired association navigation task has been
postulated to be schema-dependent. However, the correspondence between schemas
and neural implementations remains poorly understood, and a biologically
plausible computational model of the rodents learning has not been
demonstrated. Here, we compose such an agent from schemas with biologically
plausible neural implementations. The agent contains an associative memory that
can form one-shot associations between sensory cues and goal coordinates,
implemented using a network with either a feedforward layer or a reservoir of
recurrently connected neurons whose plastic output weights are governed by a
novel 4-factor reward modulated Exploratory Hebbian (EH) rule. Adding an
actor-critic allows the agent to succeed even if obstacles prevent direct
heading. With the addition of working memory, the rodent behavior is
replicated. Temporal-difference learning of a working memory gate enables
one-shot learning despite distractors.

					<dc:description>  The simulation of time evolution of large quantum systems is a classically
challenging and in general intractable task, making it a promising application
for quantum computation. A Trotter-Suzuki approximation yields an
implementation thereof, where a higher approximation accuracy can be traded for
an increased gate count. In this work, we introduce a variational algorithm
which uses solutions of classical optimizations to predict efficient quantum
circuits for time evolution of translationally invariant quantum systems. Our
strategy can improve upon the Trotter-Suzuki accuracy by several orders of
magnitude. It translates into a reduction in gate count and hence gain in
overall fidelity at the same algorithmic accuracy. This is important in
NISQ-applications where the fidelity of the output state decays exponentially
with the number of gates. The performance advantage of our classical assisted
strategy can be extended to open boundaries with translational symmetry in the
bulk. We can extrapolate our method to beyond classically simulatable system
sizes, maintaining its total fidelity advantage over a Trotter-Suzuki
approximation making it an interesting candidate for beyond classical time
evolution.

					<dc:description>  We present a novel offline-online method to mitigate the computational burden
of the characterization of posterior random variables in statistical learning.
In the offline phase, the proposed method learns the joint law of the parameter
random variables and the observable random variables in the tensor-train (TT)
format. In the online phase, the resulting order-preserving conditional
transport can characterize the posterior random variables given newly observed
data in real time. Compared with the state-of-the-art normalizing flow
techniques, the proposed method relies on function approximation and is
equipped with a thorough performance analysis. The function approximation
perspective also allows us to further extend the capability of transport maps
in challenging problems with high-dimensional observations and high-dimensional
parameters. On the one hand, we present novel heuristics to reorder and/or
reparametrize the variables to enhance the approximation power of TT. On the
other hand, we integrate the TT-based transport maps and the parameter
reordering/reparametrization into layered compositions to further improve the
performance of the resulting transport maps. We demonstrate the efficiency of
the proposed method on various statistical learning tasks in ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).

					<dc:description>  Magnetars have been proposed to be the origin of FRBs soon after its initial
discovery. The detection of the first Galactic FRB 20200428 from SGR 1935+2154
has made this hypothesis more convincing. In October 2020, this source was
supposed to be in an extremely active state again. We then carried out a
1.6-hours follow-up observation of SGR 1935+2154 using the new ultra-wideband
low (UWL) receiver of the Parkes 64\,m radio telescope covering a frequency
range of 704$-$4032 MHz. However, no convincing signal was detected in either
of our single pulse or periodicity searches. We obtained a limit on the flux
density of periodic signal of $\rm 3.6\,\mu Jy$ using the full 3.3GHz bandwidth
data sets, which is the strictest limit for that of SGR 1935+2154. Our full
bandwidth limit on the single pulses fluence is 35mJy ms, which is well below
the brightest single pulses detected by the FAST radio telescope just two
before our observation. Assuming that SGR 1935+2154 is active during our
observation, our results suggest that its radio bursts are either intrinsically
narrowband or show a steep spectrum.

					<dc:description>  We propose and investigate a general class of discrete time and finite state
space mean field game (MFG) problems with potential structure. Our model
incorporates interactions through a congestion term and a price variable. It
also allows hard constraints on the distribution of the agents. We analyze the
connection between the MFG problem and two optimal control problems in duality.
We present two families of numerical methods and detail their implementation:
(i) primal-dual proximal methods (and their extension with nonlinear proximity
operators), (ii) the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and a
variant called ADM-G. We give some convergence results. Numerical results are
provided for two examples with hard constraints.

be the semigroup under composition of all linear transformations on a vector

consider the semigroups $\overline{T}(X, Y) = \{f\in T(X)\colon Yf \subseteq
Y\}$ and $\overline{L}(V, W) = \{f\in L(V)\colon Wf \subseteq W\}$ under

$\overline{L}(V, W)$. Using these, we determine when $\overline{T}(X, Y)$ and
$\overline{L}(V, W)$ are unit-regular. We prove that $f\in L(V)$ is
unit-regular if and only if ${\rm nullity}(f) = {\rm corank}(f)$. We
alternatively prove that $L(V)$ is unit-regular if and only if $V$ is
finite-dimensional. A semi-balanced semigroup is a transformation semigroup
whose all elements are semi-balanced. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for $\overline{T}(X, Y)$, $\overline{L}(V, W)$ and $L(V)$ to be
semi-balanced.

					<dc:description>  The Cox model is an indispensable tool for time-to-event analysis,
particularly in biomedical research. However, medicine is undergoing a profound
transformation, generating data at an unprecedented scale, which opens new
frontiers to study and understand diseases. With the wealth of data collected,
new challenges for statistical inference arise, as datasets are often high
dimensional, exhibit an increasing number of measurements at irregularly spaced
time points, and are simply too large to fit in memory. Many current
implementations for time-to-event analysis are ill-suited for these problems as
inference is computationally demanding and requires access to the full data at
once. Here we propose a Bayesian version for the counting process
representation of Cox's partial likelihood for efficient inference on
large-scale datasets with millions of data points and thousands of
time-dependent covariates. Through the combination of stochastic variational
inference and a reweighting of the log-likelihood, we obtain an approximation
for the posterior distribution that factorizes over subsamples of the data,
enabling the analysis in big data settings. Crucially, the method produces
viable uncertainty estimates for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. We
show the utility of our method through a simulation study and an application to
myocardial infarction in the UK Biobank.

					<dc:description>  Leveraging machine learning techniques for Sepsis early detection and
diagnosis has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, most
existing methods require a large amount of labeled training data, which may not
be available for a target hospital that deploys a new Sepsis detection system.
More seriously, as treated patients are diversified between hospitals, directly
applying a model trained on other hospitals may not achieve good performance
for the target hospital. To address this issue, we propose a novel
semi-supervised transfer learning framework based on optimal transport theory
and self-paced ensemble for Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, which can
efficiently transfer knowledge from the source hospital (with rich labeled
data) to the target hospital (with scarce labeled data). Specifically, SPSSOT
incorporates a new optimal transport-based semi-supervised domain adaptation
component that can effectively exploit all the unlabeled data in the target
hospital. Moreover, self-paced ensemble is adapted in SPSSOT to alleviate the
class imbalance issue during transfer learning. In a nutshell, SPSSOT is an
end-to-end transfer learning method that automatically selects suitable samples
from two domains (hospitals) respectively and aligns their feature spaces.
Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge,

					<dc:description>  Given a simple undirected graph $G$ there is a simplicial complex
$\mathrm{Ind}(G)$, called the independence complex, whose faces correspond to
the independent sets of $G$. This is a well studied concept because it provides
a fertile ground for interactions between commutative algebra, graph theory and
algebraic topology. One of the line of research pursued by many authors is to
determine the graph classes for which the associated independence complex is
Cohen-Macaulay. For example, it is known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the
complex $\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ is in fact vertex decomposable, the strongest
condition in the Cohen-Macaulay ladder.
  In this article we consider a generalization of independence complex. Given
$r\geq 1$, a subset of the vertex set is called $r$-independent if the
connected components of the induced subgraph have cardinality at most $r$. The
collection of all $r$-independent subsets of $G$ form a simplicial complex
called the $r$-independence complex and is denoted by $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. It
is known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the complex $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$ has
the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. Hence it is natural to ask which of
these complexes are shellable or even vertex decomposable. We prove, using
Woodroofe's chordal hypergraph notion, that these complexes are always
shellable when the underlying chordal graph is a tree. Further, using the
notion of vertex splittable ideals we show that for caterpillar graphs the
associated $r$-independence complex is vertex decomposable for all values of
$r$. We also construct chordal graphs on $2r+2$ vertices such that their
$r$-independence complexes are not sequentially Cohen-Macaulay for any $r \ge
2$.

					<dc:description>  We present a new variant of the secretary problem. Let $A$ be a totally
ordered set of $n$ \emph{applicants}.
  Given $P\subseteq A$ and $x\in A$, let $rr(P,x)=\vert\{z\in P \mid z\leq
x\}\vert\mbox{ }$ be the \emph{relative rank of} $x$ \emph{with regard to} $P$,
and let $rr_n(x)=rr(A,x)$. Let $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\in A$ be a random sequence of
distinct applicants. The aim is to select $1&lt;j\leq n$ such that
$rr_n(x_{j-1})-rr_n(x_j)\in\{-1,1\}$.
  Let $\alpha$ be a real constant with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. Suppose the following
stopping rule $\tau_n(\alpha)$: reject first $\alpha n$ applicants and then
select the first $x_j$ such that $rr(P_j,x_{j-1})-rr(P_j,x_j)\in\{-1,1\}$,
where $P_j=\{x_i\mid 1\leq i\leq j\}$. Let $p_{n,\tau}(\alpha)$ be the
probability that $\tau_n(\alpha)$ selects $x_j$ such that
$rr_n(x_{j-1})-rr_n(x_j)\in\{-1,1\}$. We show that
\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p_{n,\tau}(\alpha)\leq
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p_{n,\tau}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{.}\]

					<dc:description>  In the classical theory of regular languages the concept of recognition by
profinite monoids is an important tool. Beyond regularity, Boolean spaces with
internal monoids (BiMs) were recently proposed as a generalization. On the
other hand, fragments of logic defining regular languages can be studied
inductively via the so-called &quot;Substitution Principle&quot;. In this paper we make
the logical underpinnings of this principle explicit and extend it to arbitrary
languages using Stone duality. Subsequently we show how it can be used to
obtain topo-algebraic recognizers for classes of languages defined by a wide
class of first-order logic fragments. This naturally leads to a notion of
semidirect product of BiMs extending the classical such construction for
profinite monoids. Our main result is a generalization of Almeida and Weil's
Decomposition Theorem for semidirect products from the profinite setting to
that of BiMs. This is a crucial step in a program to extend the profinite
methods of regular language theory to the setting of complexity theory.

					<dc:description>  This paper explores the use of factor graphs as an inference and analysis
tool for Bayesian peer-to-peer decentralized data fusion. We propose a
framework by which agents can each use local factor graphs to represent
relevant partitions of a complex global joint probability distribution, thus
allowing them to avoid reasoning over the entirety of a more complex model and
saving communication as well as computation cost. This allows heterogeneous
multi-robot systems to cooperate on a variety of real world, task oriented
missions, where scalability and modularity are key. To develop the initial
theory and analyze the limits of this approach, we focus our attention on
static linear Gaussian systems in tree-structured networks and use Channel
Filters (also represented by factor graphs) to explicitly track common
information. We discuss how this representation can be used to describe various
multi-robot applications and to design and analyze new heterogeneous data
fusion algorithms. We validate our method in simulations of a multi-agent
multi-target tracking and cooperative multi-agent mapping problems, and discuss
the computation and communication gains of this approach.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents methods for analyzing spatial experiments when complex
spillovers, displacement effects, and other types of &quot;interference&quot; are
present. We present a robust, design-based approach to analyzing effects in
such settings. The design-based approach derives inferential properties for
causal effect estimators from known features of the experimental design, in a
manner analogous to inference in sample surveys. The methods presented here
target a quantity of interest called the &quot;average marginalized response,&quot; which
is equal to the average effect of activating a treatment at an intervention
node that is a given distance away, averaging ambient effects emanating from
other intervention nodes. We provide a step-by-step tutorial based on the
SpatialEffect package for R. We apply the methods to a randomized experiment on
payments for community forest conservation in Uganda, showing how our methods
reveal possibly substantial spatial spillovers that more conventional analyses
cannot detect.

					<dc:description>  The preparation of composite materials is promising for concurrent
optimization of electrical and thermal transport properties to realize an
improved thermoelectric (TE) performance. We report the effect of work function
and acoustic impedance mismatch (AIM) on the TE properties of
(1-z)Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te/(z)WC composite. In particular, a composite
consisting of Mn and Sb co-doped GeTe as a matrix and WC as a dispersed phase
is prepared, and its structural and TE properties are investigated. The
simultaneous increase in electrical conductivity ({\sigma}) and Seebeck
coefficient ({\alpha}) with WC volume fraction (z) results in an enhanced power
factor ({\alpha}^2{\sigma}) in the composite. The rise in {\sigma} is
attributed to increased carrier mobility in the composite. This is further
established from the work function measurement using the Kelvin probe force
microscopy (KPFM) technique and is also supported by the density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The difference in elastic properties (sound
velocity) between Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te and WC results in a high AIM that leads
to a large interface thermal resistance (Rint) between the phases. The
correlation between Rint and the Kapitza radius results in reduced phonon
thermal conductivity (\kappa_ph) of the composite and is discussed using the
Bruggeman asymmetrical model. The decrease in \kappa_{ph} is further
established using phonon dispersion calculations that indicates the decrease in
phonon group velocity in the composite. The simultaneous effect of enhanced
{\alpha}^2{\sigma} and reduced \kappa_ph results in a maximum figure of merit
(zT) of 1.93 at 773K for (1-z)Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te/(z)WC composite having
z=0.010. This study shows promise to achieve higher zTav across a wide range of
composite materials having similar electronic structure and different elastic
properties.

					<dc:description>  Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning technique to
train a global model without obtaining clients' private data. The main
challenges in FL are statistical diversity among clients, limited computing
capability among clients' equipments, and the excessive communication overhead
between the server and clients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
sparse personalized federated learning scheme via maximizing correlation
(FedMac). By incorporating an approximated L1-norm and the correlation between
client models and global model into standard FL loss function, the performance
on statistical diversity data is improved and the communicational and
computational loads required in the network are reduced compared with
non-sparse FL. Convergence analysis shows that the sparse constraints in FedMac
do not affect the convergence rate of the global model, and theoretical results
show that FedMac can achieve good sparse personalization, which is better than
the personalized methods based on L2-norm. Experimentally, we demonstrate the
benefits of this sparse personalization architecture compared with the
state-of-the-art personalization methods (e.g. FedMac respectively achieves
98.95%, 99.37%, 90.90%, 89.06% and 73.52% accuracy on the MNIST, FMNIST,
CIFAR-100, Synthetic and CINIC-10 datasets under non-i.i.d. variants).

					<dc:title>Demonstration of quantum correlations that are incompatible with

					<dc:creator>Sarkar, Shubhayan</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Saha, Debashis</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Exploiting the tension between the two dynamics of quantum theory (QT) in the
Wigner's Friend thought experiment, we point out that the standard QT leads to
inconsistency in observed probabilities of measurement outcomes between two
super-observers - Wigner and his Student. To avoid such inconsistent
predictions of QT, we hypothesize two distinct perspectives. The first one is
&quot;Absoluteness of measurement (AoM),&quot; that is, any measurement process is an
absolute event irrespective of other observers and yields a single outcome. The
other is &quot;Non-absoluteness of measurement (NoM)&quot; as the negation of AoM. We
introduce an operational approach, first with one friend and then with two
spatially separated friends, to test the validity of these two perceptions in
quantum theory without assuming the details of the experiment. First, we show
that the set of probabilities obtainable for NoM is strictly larger than the
set obtainable for AoM. We provide the simplest scenario so far, involving a
single quantum preparation and one unitary operation by a super-observer that
can demonstrate correlations incompatible with AoM. Remarkably, in the scenario
with spatially separated observers, we present a strict hierarchy among the
sets of probabilities observed in the following three theories: classical or
local realist, quantum theory with AoM, and quantum theory with NoM.

					<dc:description>  Punctuation is critical in understanding natural language text. Currently,
most automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems do not generate punctuation,
which affects the performance of downstream tasks, such as intent detection and
slot filling. This gives rise to the need for punctuation restoration. Recent
work in punctuation restoration heavily utilizes pre-trained language models
without considering data imbalance when predicting punctuation classes. In this
work, we address this problem by proposing a token-level supervised contrastive
learning method that aims at maximizing the distance of representation of
different punctuation marks in the embedding space. The result shows that
training with token-level supervised contrastive learning obtains up to 3.2%
absolute F1 improvement on the test set.

					<dc:description>  A novel approach was derived to compute the elastic displacement field from a
measured elastic deformation field (i.e., deformation gradient or strain). The
method is based on integrating the deformation field using Finite Element
discretisation. Space and displacement fields are approximated using piece-wise
interpolation functions. Hence, the full elastic deformation field can be
expressed as nodal displacements, the unknowns. The nodal displacements are
then obtained using a least square method. The proposed method was applied to
the symmetrical (residual) elastic deformation field measured using high
(angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction around a Vickers
micro-indenting impression on a (001) mono-Si crystal sample with the
integrated out-of-plane surface displacements matched with the impression
topography measured using. The (residual) displacement field was used as the
boundary conditions to calculate the three-dimensional stress intensity factors
(K_(I,II,III)) at the cracks emanating from the indentation.

					<dc:description>  The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an
autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using
neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A
challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that
under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent
retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate.
Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples,
it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We
propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot)
domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks.
Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised
domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source
distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution
using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a
generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN),
and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a
set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used
to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the
distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the
source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common
to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.

					<dc:description>  From a practical perspective it is advantageous to develop experimental
methods that verify entanglement in quantum states with as few measurements as
possible. In this paper we investigate the minimal number of measurements
needed to detect bound entanglement in bipartite $(d\times d)$-dimensional
states, i.e. entangled states that are positive under partial transposition. In
particular, we show that a class of entanglement witnesses composed of mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs) can detect bound entanglement if the number of
measurements is greater than $d/2+1$. This is a substantial improvement over
other detection methods, requiring significantly fewer resources than either
full quantum state tomography or measuring a complete set of $d+1$ MUBs. Our
approach is based on a partial characterisation of the (non-)decomposability of
entanglement witnesses. We show that non-decomposability is a universal
property of MUBs, which holds regardless of the choice of complementary
observables, and we find that both the number of measurements and the structure
of the witness play an important role in the detection of bound entanglement.

					<dc:description>  We theoretically study the dc conductivity of a disordered 2D metal when it
is coupled to a gas of magnons with a standard quadratic spectrum and a gap
$\Delta$. In the diffusive limit, a combination of disorder, magnon-mediated
electron-electron interactions, and magnon Gilbert damping leads to a singular
correction to the Drude conductivity that diverges logarithmically as the
magnon gap approaches zero | $\delta\sigma_s\propto\ln(k_BT/\Delta)$ as
$\Delta\rightarrow 0$ | where $T$ is the temperature of the heterostructure. We
find that this correction is metallic and therefore counteracts the localizing
tendency of a disordered 2D metal. The possibility of verifying this prediction
in an $S=1/2$ easy-plane ferromagnetic insulator K$_2$CuF$_4$ under an external
magnetic field is proposed.

					<dc:description>  Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is a popular nonparametric regression
model. In GPR, features of the regression function such as varying degrees of
smoothness and periodicities are modeled through combining various covarinace
kernels, which are supposed to model certain effects. The covariance kernels
have unknown parameters which are estimated by the EM-algorithm or Markov Chain
Monte Carlo. The estimated parameters are keys to the inference of the features
of the regression functions, but identifiability of these parameters has not
been investigated. In this paper, we prove identifiability of covariance kernel
parameters in two radial basis mixed kernel GPR and radial basis and periodic
mixed kernel GPR. We also provide some examples about non-identifiable cases in
such mixed kernel GPRs.

					<dc:description>  In this article, we investigate various physical implications of quantum
circuit complexity using squeezed state formalism of Primordial Gravitational
Waves (PGW). Recently quantum information theoretic concepts, such as
entanglement entropy, and complexity are playing a pivotal role to understand
the dynamics of quantum system even in the diverse fields such as, high energy
physics and cosmology. This paper is devoted in studying quantum circuit
complexity of PGW for various cosmological models, such as de Sitter,
inflation, radiation, reheating, matter, bouncing, cyclic and black hole gas
model etc. We compute complexity measure using both Covariance and Nielsen's
wave function method for three different choices of quantum initial vacua:
Motta-Allen, $\alpha$ and Bunch-Davies. Besides computing circuit complexity,
we have also computed Von-Neumann entanglement entropy. By making the
comparison of complexity with entanglement entropy, we are able to probe
various features regarding the dynamics of evolution for different cosmological
models. Because entanglement entropy is independent of the squeezing angle, we
are able to understand more details of the system using Nielsen's measure of
complexity which is dependent on both squeezing parameter and angle. This
implies that quantum complexity could indeed be a useful probe to study quantum
features in cosmological scale. Quantum complexity is also becoming a powerful
technique to understand the chaotic behaviour and random fluctuations of
quantum fields. Using the growth of complexity, we are able to compute quantum
Lyapunov exponent for various cosmological models and comment on it's chaotic
nature.

					<dc:description>  Applications of the quantum switch on quantum channels have recently become a
topic of intense discussion. In the present work, we show that some useless
(for communication) channels may provide useful communication under the action
of quantum switch for several information-theoretic tasks: quantum random
access codes, quantum steering, etc. We demonstrate that the quantum switch can
also be useful in preventing the loss of coherence in a system when only
coherence-breaking channels are the available channels for communication. We
also show that if a useless quantum channel does not provide useful
communication even after using a quantum switch, concatenating the channel with
another suitable quantum channel, and subsequently using the switch, one may
achieve useful communication. Finally, we discuss how the introduction of noise
in the quantum switch can reduce the advantage that the switch provides.

					<dc:description>  Effects of finite ion temperature on plasma flow in the converging-diverging
magnetic field, the magnetic mirror, or equivalently, magnetic nozzle
configuration, are studied using a quasineutral paraxial two-fluid MHD model
with isothermal electrons and warm magnetized ions. The ion acceleration was
studied with an emphasis on the role of the singularity at the sonic point
transition. It is shown that the regularity of the sonic point defines a global
solution describing plasma acceleration from subsonic to supersonic velocity.
Stationary accelerating solutions were obtained and compared with the time
dependent dynamics, confirming that the solutions of the time-dependent
equations converge to the stationary solutions and therefore are stable. The
effects of the ion pressure anisotropy were analyzed using Chew-Goldberger-Low
model and its generalization. It is shown that the mirror force (manifested by
the perpendicular ion pressure) enhances plasma acceleration. The role of
ionization and charge exchange on plasma flow acceleration have been
investigated.

					<dc:description>  A trajectory of a destination-directed moving object (e.g. an aircraft from
an origin airport to a destination airport) has three main components: an
origin, a destination, and motion in between. We call such a trajectory that
end up at the destination \textit{destination-directed trajectory (DDT)}. A
class of conditionally Markov (CM) sequences (called CM$_\text{L}$) has the
following main components: a joint density of two endpoints and a Markov-like
evolution law. A CM$_\text{L}$ dynamic model can describe the evolution of a
DDT but not of a guided object chasing a moving guide. The trajectory of a
guided object is called a \textit{guided trajectory (GT)}. Inspired by a
CM$_\text{L}$ model, this paper proposes a model for a GT with a moving guide.
The proposed model reduces to a CM$_\text{L}$ model if the guide is not moving.
We also study filtering and trajectory prediction based on the proposed model.
Simulation results are presented.

					<dc:description>  Based on the recent advancements in representation learning, we propose a
novel pipeline for task-oriented voice-controlled robots with raw sensor
inputs. Previous methods rely on a large number of labels and task-specific
reward functions. Not only can such an approach hardly be improved after the
deployment, but also has limited generalization across robotic platforms and
tasks. To address these problems, our pipeline first learns a visual-audio
representation (VAR) that associates images and sound commands. Then the robot
learns to fulfill the sound command via reinforcement learning using the reward
generated by the VAR. We demonstrate our approach with various sound types,
robots, and tasks. We show that our method outperforms previous work with much
fewer labels. We show in both the simulated and real-world experiments that the
system can self-improve in previously unseen scenarios given a reasonable
number of newly labeled data.

$d = 2$, focusing on the intermediate disorder regime when the model undergoes

random field of partition functions has a unique scaling limit: a universal
process of random measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with logarithmic correlations,
which we call the *Critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow*. It is the natural
candidate for the long sought solution of the critical 2d Stochastic Heat
Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise.

					<dc:description>  Pervasive cross-section dependence is increasingly recognized as a
characteristic of economic data and the approximate factor model provides a
useful framework for analysis. Assuming a strong factor structure where
$\Lop\Lo/N^\alpha$ is positive definite in the limit when $\alpha=1$, early
work established convergence of the principal component estimates of the
factors and loadings up to a rotation matrix. This paper shows that the
estimates are still consistent and asymptotically normal when $\alpha\in(0,1]$
albeit at slower rates and under additional assumptions on the sample size. The
results hold whether $\alpha$ is constant or varies across factor loadings. The
framework developed for heterogeneous loadings and the simplified proofs that
can be also used in strong factor analysis are of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  Scintillator detectors electronics is recalibrated against the datasheet
given by the manufacturer. Optimal and mutual dependent values of (a) high
voltage at PMT (Photomultiplier Tube), (b) amplifier gain, (c) average time to
count the radiation particles (set by operator), and (d) number of
instances/sample number are estimated. Total 5: two versions of Central Limit
Theorem (CLT), (3) industry preferred Pulse Width Saturation, (4) calibration
based on MPPC coupled Gamma-ray detector and (5) gross method are used. It is
shown that CLT method is the most optimal method to calibrate detector and its
respective electronics couple. An inverse modeling-based Computerized
Tomography method is used for verification. It is shown that statistically
averaging results are more accurate and precise data than mode and median, if
the data is not skewed and random number of samples are used during the
calibration process. It is also shown that the average time to count the
radiation particle is the most important parameter affecting the optimal
calibration setting for precision and accurate measurements of gamma radiation.

					<dc:description>  Modern deep learning models are notoriously opaque, which has motivated the
development of methods for interpreting how deep models predict. This goal is
usually approached with attribution method, which assesses the influence of
features on model predictions. As an explanation method, the evaluation
criteria of attribution methods is how accurately it re-reflects the actual
reasoning process of the model (faithfulness). Meanwhile, since the reasoning
process of deep models is inaccessible, researchers design various evaluation
methods to demonstrate their arguments. However, some crucial logic traps in
these evaluation methods are ignored in most works, causing inaccurate
evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper systematically reviews existing
methods for evaluating attribution scores and summarizes the logic traps in
these methods. We further conduct experiments to demonstrate the existence of
each logic trap. Through both the theoretical and experimental analysis, we
hope to increase attention on the inaccurate evaluation of attribution scores.
Moreover, with this paper, we suggest stopping focusing on improving
performance under unreliable evaluation systems and starting efforts on
reducing the impact of proposed logic traps

					<dc:description>  An angular time-dependent probability density function describing Brownian or
anomalous rotational dynamics of fixed-length atom-to-atom vectors is
presented. The probability density function, which fully incorporates angular
boundary conditions, is applied to aqueous ion complexes. The rotational
dynamics of ion-$^1$H vectors are shown by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
to be Brownian. A Brownian shell model is presented which yields a closed form
expression for the frequency-dependent nuclear-magnetic-resonance spin-lattice
relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}(\omega)$ based on a distance parameter and time
constant. Appropriate combinations of shell and/or continuum models are shown
to provide excellent fully-quantitative fits to experimental $T_1^{-1}(\omega)$
dispersion curves from aqueous manganese(II), iron(III) and copper(II) chloride
solutions. The distance parameters and time constants obtained from the fits
are in good agreement with independent experimental and MD data in the
literature. The Brownian shell model is a significant enhancement to existing
particle-particle models that describe the rotational correlation function as a
single exponential and are unable to provide the correct distance dependence
for a shell of $^1$H spin density preventing a match to experiment without an
arbitrary scaling factor.

					<dc:description>  Qubit measurement is generally the most error-prone operation that degrades
the performance of near-term quantum devices, and the exponential decay of
readout fidelity severely impedes the development of large-scale quantum
information processing. Given these disadvantages, we present a quantum state
readout method, named \textit{compression readout}, that naturally avoids large
multi-qubit measurement errors by compressing the quantum state into a single
qubit for measurement. Our method generally outperforms direct measurements in
terms of accuracy, and the advantage grows with the system size. Moreover,
because only one-qubit measurements are performed, our method requires solely a
fine readout calibration on one qubit and is free of correlated measurement
error, which drastically diminishes the demand for device calibration. These
advantages suggest that our method can immediately boost the readout
performance of near-term quantum devices and will greatly benefit the
development of large-scale quantum computing.

					<dc:description>  We study fast / slow systems driven by a fractional Brownian motion $B$ with
Hurst parameter $H\in (\frac 13, 1]$. Surprisingly, the slow dynamic converges
on suitable timescales to a limiting Markov process and we describe its
generator. More precisely, if $Y^\varepsilon$ denotes a Markov process with
sufficiently good mixing properties evolving on a fast timescale $\varepsilon
\ll 1$, the solutions of the equation $$ dX^\varepsilon = \varepsilon^{\frac
12-H} F(X^\varepsilon,Y^\varepsilon)\,dB+F_0(X^\varepsilon,Y^\varepsilon)\,dt\;
$$ converge to a regular diffusion without having to assume that $F$ averages
to $0$, provided that $H&lt; \frac 12$. For $H &gt; \frac 12$, a similar result
holds, but this time it does require $F$ to average to $0$. We also prove that
the $n$-point motions converge to those of a Kunita type SDE.
  One nice interpretation of this result is that it provides a continuous
interpolation between the homogenisation theorem for random ODEs with rapidly
oscillating right-hand sides ($H=1$) and the averaging of diffusion processes
($H= \frac 12$).

					<dc:description>  Contextual dynamic pricing aims to set personalized prices based on
sequential interactions with customers. At each time period, a customer who is
interested in purchasing a product comes to the platform. The customer's
valuation for the product is a linear function of contexts, including product
and customer features, plus some random market noise. The seller does not
observe the customer's true valuation, but instead needs to learn the valuation
by leveraging contextual information and historical binary purchase feedbacks.
Existing models typically assume full or partial knowledge of the random noise
distribution. In this paper, we consider contextual dynamic pricing with
unknown random noise in the valuation model. Our distribution-free pricing
policy learns both the contextual function and the market noise simultaneously.
A key ingredient of our method is a novel perturbed linear bandit framework,
where a modified linear upper confidence bound algorithm is proposed to balance
the exploration of market noise and the exploitation of the current knowledge
for better pricing. We establish the regret upper bound and a matching lower
bound of our policy in the perturbed linear bandit framework and prove a
sub-linear regret bound in the considered pricing problem. Finally, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our policy on simulations and a
real-life auto-loan dataset.

optimization of expensive real-world functions. Contrary to a common
expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually
requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such
domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify
initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is
non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for
hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where
landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an
alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we
consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us
to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori.
  In this work, we detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL
divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO
framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions
and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the &quot;ground truth&quot; GP prior
is known. To verify our approach in realistic model training setups, we collect
a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands
of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on popular
image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our results
show that on average, HyperBO is able to locate good hyperparameters at least 3
times more efficiently than the best competing methods on both our new tuning
dataset and classic multi-task BO benchmarks.

					<dc:description>  We give a simple topological construction of the Burau representations of the
loop braid groups. There are four versions: defined either on the non-extended
or extended loop braid groups, and in each case there is an unreduced and a
reduced version. Three are not surprising, and one could easily guess the
correct matrices to assign to generators. The fourth is more subtle, and does
not seem combinatorially obvious, although it is topologically very natural.

					<dc:title>The longest edge in discrete and continuous long-range percolation</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Rousselle, Arnaud</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We consider both a discrete and continuous variant of long-range percolation
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in which an edge between two points at distance $r$ is
present with probability $\bar{g}(r)$. We elucidate yet unrevealed properties
these models exhibit, namely by investigating the longest edge with at least
one endpoint within some finite observation window, as the volume of this
window tends to infinity. We show that the length of the latter in the
continuous model, after normalizing by some appropriate centering and scaling
sequences, asymptotically behaves like one of each of the three extreme value
distributions, depending on choices of the probability $\bar{g}(r)$. In the
discrete variant the results are more intriguing as we encounter subtle
differences to the continuous model. In particular, our results highlight an
unexpected behavior of the longest edge in the Fr\'echet case when $d=1$ and
$\alpha=2$ in discrete long-range percolation. Parts of the proof employ the
Chen-Stein method, a general result on Poisson approximation related to Stein's
method and Palm calculus.

					<dc:description>  Measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies,
such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, will enable new tests of neutrino
and dark sector properties. The kinetic SZ (kSZ) effect is produced by
cosmological flows, probing structure growth. Ultra-light axions (ULAs) are a
well-motivated dark-matter candidate. Here the impact of ULA dark matter (with
mass $10^{-27}~{\rm eV}$ to $10^{-23}~{\rm eV}$) on kSZ observables is
determined, applying new analytic expressions for pairwise cluster velocities
and Ostriker-Vishniac signatures in structure-suppressing models. For the
future CMB-S4 and ongoing DESI galaxy surveys, the kSZ effect (along with
primary anisotropies) will probe ULA fractions $\eta_a =
\Omega_{\rm{axion}}/\Omega_{\rm DM}$ as low as $\sim 5\%$ if $m_{a}\simeq
10^{-27}~{\rm eV}$ (at 95\% C.L.), with sensitivity extending up to
$m_{a}\simeq 10^{-25}~{\rm eV}$. If reionization and the primary CMB can be
adequately modeled, Ostriker-Vishniac measurements could probe values
$\eta_{a}\simeq 10^{-3}$ if $10^{-27}~{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim
10^{-24}~{\rm eV}$, or $\eta_{a}\simeq 1$ if $m_{a}\simeq 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$,
within the fuzzy dark matter window.

					<dc:description>  We use Whitham deformations to give a complete account of spectral data of
real solutions of the sinh--Gordon equation of spectral genus 2. We
parameterise the closure of spectral data of constant mean curvature tori in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ by an isosceles right triangle and analyse its boundary. We
prove that the Wente family, which is described by spectral data with real
coefficients, is parameterised by the bisector of the right angle. Our methods
combine blowups of Whitham deformations and spectral data in an innovative way
that changes the underlying integrable system.

					<dc:description>  Consider an assignment of bits to the vertices of a connected graph $G(V,E)$
with the property that the value of each vertex is a function of the values of
its neighbors. A collection of such assignments is called a {\em storage code}
of length $|V|$ on $G$. The storage code problem can be equivalently formulated
as maximizing the probability of success in a {\em guessing game} on graphs, or
constructing {\em index codes} of small rate.
  If $G$ contains many cliques, it is easy to construct codes of rate close to
1, so a natural problem is to construct high-rate codes on triangle-free
graphs, where constructing codes of rate $&gt;1/2$ is a nontrivial task, with few
known results. In this work we construct infinite families of linear storage
codes with high rate relying on coset graphs of binary linear codes. We also
derive necessary conditions for such codes to have high rate, and even rate
potentially close to one.
  We also address correction of multiple erasures in the codeword, deriving
recovery guarantees based on expansion properties of the graph.
  Finally, we point out connections between linear storage codes and quantum
CSS codes, a link to bootstrap percolation and contagion spread in graphs, and
formulate a number of open problems.

					<dc:description>  Dark matter (DM) detectors employing a Spherical Proportional Counter (SPC)
have demonstrated a single-electron detection threshold and are projected to
have small background rates. We explore the sensitivity to DM-electron
scattering with SPC detectors in the context of DarkSphere, a proposal for a
300 cm diameter fully-electroformed SPC. SPCs can run with different gases, so
we investigate the sensitivity for five targets: helium, neon, xenon, methane,
and isobutane. We use tools from quantum chemistry to model the atomic and
molecular systems, and calculate the expected DM induced event rates. We find
that DarkSphere has the potential to improve current exclusion limits on DM
masses above 4 MeV by up to five orders of magnitude. Neon is the best
all-round gas target and provides good sensitivity to scenarios with both light
and heavy mediators. Gas mixtures, where methane or isobutane is added to a
noble gas, can extend the sensitivity at lower masses. Our study highlights the
currently untapped potential of SPCs to search for DM-electron scattering in
the MeV-to-GeV DM mass range.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  Off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms commonly compensate for
overestimation bias during temporal-difference learning by utilizing
pessimistic estimates of the expected target returns. In this work, we propose
Generalized Pessimism Learning (GPL), a strategy employing a novel learnable
penalty to enact such pessimism. In particular, we propose to learn this
penalty alongside the critic with dual TD-learning, a new procedure to estimate
and minimize the magnitude of the target returns bias with trivial
computational cost. GPL enables us to accurately counteract overestimation bias
throughout training without incurring the downsides of overly pessimistic
targets. By integrating GPL with popular off-policy algorithms, we achieve
state-of-the-art results in both competitive proprioceptive and pixel-based
benchmarks.

					<dc:description>  We report a fast-track computationally-driven discovery of new SARS-CoV2 Main
Protease (M$^{pro}$) inhibitors whose potency range from mM for initial
non-covalent ligands to sub-$\mu$M for the final covalent compound (IC50=830
+/- 50 nM). The project extensively relied on high-resolution all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations and absolute binding free energy calculations
performed using the polarizable AMOEBA force field. The study is complemented
by extensive adaptive sampling simulations that are used to rationalize the
different ligands binding poses through the explicit reconstruction of the
ligand-protein conformation spaces. Machine Learning predictions are also
performed to predict selected compound properties. While simulations
extensively use High Performance Computing to strongly reduce time-to-solution,
they were systematically coupled to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments to
drive synthesis and to in vitro characterization of compounds. Such study
highlights the power of in silico strategies that rely on structure-based
approaches for drug design and allows to address the protein conformational
multiplicity problem. The proposed fluorinated tetrahydroquinolines open routes
for further optimization of M$^{pro}$ inhibitors towards low nM affinities.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we prove a conjecture of Ginzburg and Soudry on an integral
representation for the $L$-function $L^S(s, \pi\times \tau)$ attached to a pair
$(\pi, \tau)$ of irreducible automorphic cuspidal representations of
$\mathrm{Sp}_4({\mathbb A})$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb A})$, which is derived
from the generalized doubling method of Cai, Friedberg, Ginzburg and Kaplan. We
show that the integral unfolds to a non-unique model and analyze it using the
New Way method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis. As applications, we determine
the poles of $L^S(s, \pi\times \tau)$ and relate the existence of the poles to
the non-vanishing of certain period integrals. Moreover, for certain family of
cuspidal representations $\tau$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb A})$, we prove that
$L^S(s, \pi\times \tau)$ is holomorphic.

					<dc:description>  We present a simple linear programming (LP) based method to learn compact and
interpretable sets of rules encoding the facts in a knowledge graph (KG) and
use these rules to solve the KG completion problem. Our LP model chooses a set
of rules of bounded complexity from a list of candidate first-order logic rules
and assigns weights to them. The complexity bound is enforced via explicit
constraints. We combine simple rule generation heuristics with our rule
selection LP to obtain predictions with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
codes, even while generating much more compact rule sets. Furthermore, when we
take as input rules generated by other codes, we often improve interpretability
by reducing the number of chosen rules, while maintaining accuracy.

					<dc:description>  Black holes are defined as a region in spacetime where gravity is so strong
that particles and electromagnetic radiation cannot escape. According to their
mass, they are classified into three types: stellar-mass black holes,
intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes. This entry
describes how to weight and detect these three types of black holes, summarizes
key research findings such as the universality of black hole accretion and
black hole-galaxy co-evolution, and gives an outlook to what the next
generation of observational facilities will provide.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous grasping is an important factor for robots physically interacting
with the environment and executing versatile tasks. However, a universally
applicable, cost-effective, and rapidly deployable autonomous grasping approach
is still limited by those target objects with fuzzy-depth information. Examples
are transparent, specular, flat, and small objects whose depth is difficult to
be accurately sensed. In this work, we present a solution to those fuzzy-depth
objects. The framework of our approach includes two major components: one is a
soft robotic hand and the other one is a Fuzzy-depth Soft Grasping (FSG)
algorithm. The soft hand is replaceable for most existing soft hands/grippers
with body compliance. FSG algorithm exploits both RGB and depth images to
predict grasps while not trying to reconstruct the whole scene. Two grasping
primitives are designed to further increase robustness. The proposed method
outperforms reference baselines in unseen fuzzy-depth objects grasping
experiments (84% success rate).

					<dc:description>  Aggregated predictors are obtained by making a set of basic predictors vote
according to some weights, that is, to some probability distribution.
  Randomized predictors are obtained by sampling in a set of basic predictors,
according to some prescribed probability distribution.
  Thus, aggregated and randomized predictors have in common that they are not
defined by a minimization problem, but by a probability distribution on the set
of predictors. In statistical learning theory, there is a set of tools designed
to understand the generalization ability of such procedures: PAC-Bayesian or
PAC-Bayes bounds.
  Since the original PAC-Bayes bounds of D. McAllester, these tools have been
considerably improved in many directions (we will for example describe a
simplified version of the localization technique of O. Catoni that was missed
by the community, and later rediscovered as &quot;mutual information bounds&quot;). Very
recently, PAC-Bayes bounds received a considerable attention: for example there
was workshop on PAC-Bayes at NIPS 2017, &quot;(Almost) 50 Shades of Bayesian
Learning: PAC-Bayesian trends and insights&quot;, organized by B. Guedj, F. Bach and
P. Germain. One of the reason of this recent success is the successful
application of these bounds to neural networks by G. Dziugaite and D. Roy.
  An elementary introduction to PAC-Bayes theory is still missing. This is an
attempt to provide such an introduction.

					<dc:description>  The $\beta$-model is a powerful tool for modeling network generation driven
by degree heterogeneity. Its simple yet expressive nature particularly
well-suits large and sparse networks, where many network models become
infeasible due to computational challenge and observation scarcity. However,
existing estimation algorithms for $\beta$-model do not scale up; and
theoretical understandings remain limited to dense networks. This paper brings
several significant improvements to the method and theory of $\beta$-model to
address urgent needs of practical applications. Our contributions include: 1.
method: we propose a new $\ell_2$ penalized MLE scheme; we design a novel fast
algorithm that can comfortably handle sparse networks of millions of nodes,
much faster and more memory-parsimonious than all existing algorithms; 2.
theory: we present new error bounds on $\beta$-models under much weaker
assumptions than best known results in literature; we also establish new
lower-bounds and new asymptotic normality results; under proper parameter
sparsity assumptions, we show the first local rate-optimality result in
$\ell_2$ norm; distinct from existing literature, our results cover both small
and large regularization scenarios and reveal their distinct asymptotic
dependency structures; 3. application: we apply our method to large COVID-19
network data sets and discover meaningful results.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a low-latency hardware accelerator for modular polynomial
multiplication for lattice-based post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic
encryption applications. The proposed novel modular polynomial multiplier
exploits the fast finite impulse response (FIR) filter architecture to reduce
the computational complexity of the schoolbook modular polynomial
multiplication. We also extend this structure to fast $M$-parallel
architectures while achieving low-latency, high-speed, and full hardware
utilization. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed
architectures under various polynomial settings as well as in the Saber scheme
for post-quantum cryptography as a case study. The experimental results show
that our proposed modular polynomial multiplier reduces the computation time
and area-time product, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

					<dc:description>  Detecting navigable space is a fundamental capability for mobile robots
navigating in unknown or unmapped environments. In this work, we treat visual
navigable space segmentation as a scene decomposition problem and propose
Polyline Segmentation Variational autoencoder Network (PSV-Net), a
representation learning-based framework for learning the navigable space
segmentation in a self-supervised manner. Current segmentation techniques
heavily rely on fully-supervised learning strategies which demand a large
amount of pixel-level annotated images. In this work, we propose a framework
leveraging a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and an AutoEncoder (AE) to learn a
polyline representation that compactly outlines the desired navigable space
boundary. Through extensive experiments, we validate that the proposed PSV-Net
can learn the visual navigable space with no or few labels, producing an
accuracy comparable to fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods that use all
available labels. In addition, we show that integrating the proposed navigable
space segmentation model with a visual planner can achieve efficient mapless
navigation in real environments.

					<dc:description>  We constrain the parameters of a representative new physics model with
possible dark matter (DM) signature from a global CKM fit analysis. The model
has neutral quark current interactions mediated by a scalar, impacting the
semileptonic and purely leptonic meson decays at one-loop. We take this
opportunity to update the fit results for the Wolfenstein parameters and the
CKM elements with and without a contribution from the new model using several
other updated inputs. Alongside, we have analyzed and included in the CKM fit
the $B\to D^*\ell\nu_{\ell}$ decay. The newly available inputs on the relevant
form factors from lattice are included, and the possibility of new physics
effects in $B\to D^*\ell\nu_{\ell}$ is considered. We obtain tight constraints
on the relevant new physics parameters. We have studied the possible
implications of this constraint on DM phenomenology. Apart from DM, the bounds
are also applicable in other relevant phenomenological studies.

					<dc:description>  The dissemination and reach of scientific knowledge have increased at a
blistering pace. In this context, e-print servers have played a central role by
providing scientists with a rapid and open mechanism for disseminating research
without having to wait for the (lengthy) peer review process. While helping the
scientific community in several ways, e-print servers also provide scientific
communicators and the general public with access to a wealth of knowledge
without having to pay hefty subscription fees. This motivates us to study how
e-prints are positioned within Web community discussions. In this paper, we
study data from two Web communities: 14 years of Reddit data and over four
years of 4chan's Politically Incorrect board data. Our findings show the
presence of e-prints in both science-enthusiast and general-audience
communities. We find that real-world events and distinct factors influence the
e-prints people's discussions. For instance, there was a surge of
COVID-19-related research publications during the early months of the outbreak
and a corresponding increase in the number of references to e-prints in online
discussions. The similarity measurement result between e-prints and online
discussions referencing them has low similarity, which shows that the online
discussions are not exclusively talked about the findings in the referred
e-prints. Our examination of a sample of threads shows 1) misinterpretation and
generalization of research findings, 2) early research findings amplified as a
source for future predictions, and 3) questioning findings from a
pseudoscientific e-print. Overall, our work highlights the need to quickly and
effectively validate non-peer-reviewed e- prints that get substantial
press/social media coverage to help mitigate wrongful interpretations of
scientific outputs.

					<dc:description>  We show the $L^r(\mathbb{R}^d, \mu)$-uniqueness for any $r \in (1, 2]$ and
the essential self-adjointness of a Dirichlet operator $Lf = \Delta f +\langle
\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla \rho , \nabla f \rangle$, $f \in
C_0^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d \geq 3$ and $\mu=\rho dx$. In particular,
$\nabla \rho$ is allowed to be in $L^d_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^d)$ or in
$L^{2+\varepsilon}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^d)$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$,
while $\rho$ is required to be locally bounded below and above by strictly
positive constants. The main tools in this paper are elliptic regularity
results for divergence and non-divergence type operators and basic properties
of Dirichlet forms and their resolvents.

					<dc:description>  The iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) have recently emerged as a promising
single-material Majorana platform by hosting isolated Majorana zero modes
(MZMs) at relatively high temperatures. To further verify its Majorana nature
and move forward to build topological quantum qubit, it is highly desirable to
achieve tunability for MZMs on homogeneous FeSCs. Here, with an in-situ strain
device, we can controllably create MZMs on the homogeneous surface of
stoichiometric superconductor LiFeAs by inducing a topological phase
transition. The evolution of discrete energy modes inside a strained vortex is
found to mimics exactly as the predicted topological vortex case, proving the
Majorana nature of emerging zero modes of vortex. Such tunability of MZMs in a
homogeneous superconductor is an important step toward their application in
topological quantum computation.

					<dc:description>  We consider degenerate porous medium equations with a divergence type of
drift terms. We establish the existence of $L^{q}$-weak solutions (satisfying
energy estimates or even further with moment and speed estimates in Wasserstein
spaces), in case the drift term belongs to a sub-scaling (including scaling
invariant) class depending on $q$ and $m$ caused by the nonlinear structure of
diffusion, which is a major difference compared to that of a linear case. It is
noticeable that the classes of drift terms become wider if the drift term is
divergence-free. Similar conditions of gradients of drift terms are also
provided to ensure the existence of such weak solutions. Uniqueness results
follow under an additional condition on the gradients of the drift terms with
the aid of methods developed in Wasserstein spaces. One of our main tools is so
called the splitting method to construct a sequence of approximated solutions,
which implies, bypassing to the limit, the existence of weak solutions
satisfying not only an energy inequality but also moment and speed estimates.
One of the crucial points in the construction is uniform H\&quot;{o}lder continuity
up to initial time for homogeneous porous medium equations, which seems to be
of independent interest. As an application, we improve a regularity result for
solutions of a repulsive Keller-Segel system of porous medium type.

					<dc:description>  Driven by the &quot;user-centered design&quot; philosophy, this paper first outlines

					<dc:title>Edge connectivity of simplicial polytopes</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>52B05</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A simplicial polytope is a polytope with all its facets being combinatorially
equivalent to simplices. We deal with the edge connectivity of the graphs of
simplicial polytopes. We first establish that, for any $d\ge 3$, for any $d\ge
3$, every minimum edge cut of cardinality at most $4d-7$ in such a graph is
\textit{trivial}, namely it consists of all the edges incident with some
vertex. A consequence of this is that, for $d\ge 3$, the graph of a simplicial
$d$-polytope with minimum degree $\delta$ is
$\min\{\delta,4d-6\}$-edge-connected. In the particular case of $d=3$, we have
that every minimum edge cut in a plane triangulation is trivial; this may be of
interest to researchers in graph theory.
  Second, for every $d\ge 4$ we construct a simplicial $d$-polytope whose graph
has a nontrivial minimum edge cut of cardinality $(d^{2}+d)/2$. This gives a
simplicial 4-polytope with a nontrivial minimum edge cut that has ten edges.
Thus, the aforementioned result is best possible for simplicial $4$-polytopes.

					<dc:description>  Correlation matrices are widely used to analyze the interdependence of
variables in various real-world scenarios. Often, a perturbation in a few
variables leads to mild differences in many correlation coefficients associated
with these variables. We propose an efficient low-dimensional model that
characterizes these differences as a product of single-variable effects. We
develop methods for point estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis
testing for this model. Importantly, our methods can account for both the
variability in individual correlation matrices and for within-group
variability. In simulations, our model shows increased power compared to
competing approaches. We use the model to analyze resting-state functional MRI
correlation matrices in patients with transient global amnesia and healthy
controls. Our model detects significant decreases in synchronization for the
patient population in several brain regions, which could not have been detected
using previous methods without prior knowledge. Our methods are available in
the open-source package \emph{github.com/itamarfaran/corrpops}.

over $\mathbb{F}_q\times \mathbb{F}_q$, Cilleruelo conjectured about
polynomials that could generate $q$-element Sidon sets over $\mathbb{F}_q\times
\mathbb{F}_q$.
  Here, we derive some criteria for determining polynomials that could generate
$q$-element Sidon set over $\mathbb{F}_q\times \mathbb{F}_q$. Using these
criteria, we prove that certain classes of monomials and cubic polynomials over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ cannot be used to generate $p$-element Sidon set over
$\mathbb{F}_p\times \mathbb{F}_p$. We also discover a connection between the
needed polynomials and planar polynomials.

					<dc:description>  Numerous visio-linguistic (V+L) representation learning methods have been
developed, yet existing datasets do not adequately evaluate the extent to which
they represent visual and linguistic concepts in a unified space. We propose
several novel evaluation settings for V+L models, including cross-modal
transfer. Furthermore, existing V+L benchmarks often report global accuracy
scores on the entire dataset, making it difficult to pinpoint the specific
reasoning tasks that models fail and succeed at. We present TraVLR, a synthetic
dataset comprising four V+L reasoning tasks. TraVLR's synthetic nature allows
us to constrain its training and testing distributions along task-relevant
dimensions, enabling the evaluation of out-of-distribution generalisation. Each
example in TraVLR redundantly encodes the scene in two modalities, allowing
either to be dropped or added during training or testing without losing
relevant information. We compare the performance of four state-of-the-art V+L
models, finding that while they perform well on test examples from the same
modality, they all fail at cross-modal transfer and have limited success
accommodating the addition or deletion of one modality. We release TraVLR as an
open challenge for the research community.

					<dc:description>  Despite its great success, deep learning severely suffers from robustness;
that is, deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even
the simplest ones. Inspired by recent advances in brain science, we propose the
Denoised Internal Models (DIM), a novel generative autoencoder-based model to
tackle this challenge. Simulating the pipeline in the human brain for visual
signal processing, DIM adopts a two-stage approach. In the first stage, DIM
uses a denoiser to reduce the noise and the dimensions of inputs, reflecting
the information pre-processing in the thalamus. Inspired from the sparse coding
of memory-related traces in the primary visual cortex, the second stage
produces a set of internal models, one for each category. We evaluate DIM over
42 adversarial attacks, showing that DIM effectively defenses against all the
attacks and outperforms the SOTA on the overall robustness.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In theories with unstable particles, unitarity is satisfied by the inclusion
of only stable states in unitarity sums. Hence unitarity cuts are not to be
taken through unstable particles. This raises a challenge to the generalized
unitarity method, whose aim is to reconstruct amplitudes by analyzing sets of
unitarity cuts. Nevertheless, under some general physical conditions, and
perhaps some methodological modifications, we prove that the method is still
reliable for one-loop amplitudes containing resonances. We discuss some simple
examples which illustrate these features.

					<dc:description>  In this note, we investigate homomorphisms from the periodic Floer homology
(PFH) to the quantitative Heegaard Floer homology. We call the homomorphisms
closed-open morphisms. Under certain assumptions on the Lagrangian link, we
first follow R. Lipshitz's idea to give a cylindrical formulation of the
quantitative Heegaard Floer homology. Then we construct the closed-open
morphisms from the PFH to the quantitative Heegaard Floer homology. Moreover,
we show that the morphisms are non-vanishing. As an application, we deduce a
relation between the PFH-spectral invariants and the HF-spectral invariants.

					<dc:description>  Obtaining the free energy of large molecules from quantum mechanical energy
functions is a longstanding challenge. We describe a method that allows us to
estimate, at the quantum mechanical level, the harmonic contributions to the
thermodynamics of molecular systems of large size, with modest cost. Using this
approach, we compute the vibrational thermodynamics of a series of diamond
nanocrystals, and show that the error per atom decreases with system size in
the limit of large systems. We further show that we can obtain the vibrational
contributions to the binding free energies of prototypical protein-ligand
complexes where the exact computation is too expensive to be practical. Our
work raises the possibility of routine quantum mechanical estimates of
thermodynamic quantities in complex systems.

					<dc:description>  The bundling of flagella is known to create a &quot;run&quot; phase, where the bacteria
moves in a nearly straight line rather than making changes in direction.
Historically, mechanical explanations for the bundling phenomenon intrigued
many researchers, and significant advances were made in physical models and
experimental methods. Contributing to the field of research, we present a
bacteria-inspired centimeter-scale soft robotic hardware platform and a
computational framework for a physically plausible simulation model of the
multi-flagellated robot under low Reynolds number (~0.1). The fluid-structure
interaction simulation couples the Discrete Elastic Rods algorithm with the
method of Regularized Stokeslet Segments. Contact between two flagella is
handled by a penalty-based method. We present a comparison between our
experimental and simulation results and verify that the simulation tool can
capture the essential physics of this problem. Preliminary findings on
robustness to buckling provided by the bundling phenomenon and the efficiency
of a multi-flagellated soft robot are compared with the single-flagellated
counterparts. Observations were made on the coupling between geometry and
elasticity, which manifests itself in the propulsion of the robot by nonlinear
dependency on the rotational speed of the flagella.

					<dc:description>  The anomaly cancellation is at the basis of the perturbative consistence of
the Standard Model and it provides a partial explanation of charge
quantization. We consider an effective Electroweak theory on a lattice, with a
quartic interaction describing the weak forces and an interaction with the e.m.
field. We prove the validity of the anomaly cancellation at a non perturbative
level and with a finite lattice cut-off, even if the lattice breaks some
important symmetries, on which perturbative arguments for the cancellation are
based. The method of the proof has analogies with the one adopted for
establishing universality in transport of quantum materials.

					<dc:description>  We study Euler systems for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over a number field $k$. Motivated
by a distribution-theoretic idea of Coleman, we formulate a conjecture
regarding the existence of such systems that is elementary to state and yet
strictly finer than Kato's equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for Dirichlet
$L$-series at $s=0$. To investigate the conjecture, we develop an abstract
theory of `Euler limits' and, in particular, prove the existence of canonical
`restriction' and `localisation' sequences in this theory. By using this
approach we obtain a variety of new results, ranging from a proof, modulo
standard $\mu$-vanishing hypotheses, of our central conjecture in the case $k$
is $\mathbb{Q}$ or imaginary quadratic to a proof of the `minus part' of Kato's
conjecture in the case $k$ is totally real. In proving these results, we also
show that higher-rank Euler systems for a wide class of $p$-adic
representations control the structure of Iwasawa-theoretic Selmer groups in the
manner predicted by `main conjectures'.

					<dc:description>  As a measure of vertex importance according to the graph structure, PageRank
has been widely applied in various fields. While many PageRank algorithms have
been proposed in the past decades, few of them take into account whether the
graph under investigation is directed or not. Thus, some important properties
of undirected graph\textemdash symmetry on edges, for example\textemdash is
ignored. In this paper, we propose a parallel PageRank algorithm specifically
designed for undirected graphs that can fully leverage their symmetry.
Formally, our algorithm extends the Chebyshev Polynomial approximation from the
field of real function to the field of matrix function. Essentially, it
reflects the symmetry on edges of undirected graph and the density of
diagonalizable matrix. Theoretical analysis indicates that our algorithm has a
higher convergence rate and requires less computation than the Power method,
with the convergence rate being up to 50\% higher with a damping factor of
$c=0.85$. Experiments on six datasets illustrate that our algorithm with 38
parallelism can be up to 39 times faster than the Power method.

					<dc:description>  The stability and contraction properties of positive integral semigroups on
Polish spaces are investigated. Our novel analysis is based on the extension of
V-norm contraction methods, associated to functionally weighted Banach spaces
for Markov semigroups, to positive semigroups. This methodology is applied to a
general class of positive and possibly time-inhomogeneous bounded integral
semigroups and their normalised versions. The spectral theorems that we develop
are an extension of Perron-Frobenius and Krein-Rutman theorems for positive
operators to a class of time-varying positive semigroups. In the context of
time-homogeneous models, the regularity conditions discussed in the present
article appear to be necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
leading eigenvalues. We review and illustrate the impact of these results in
the context of positive semigroups arising in transport theory, physics,
mathematical biology and signal processing.

					<dc:description>  While adversarial perturbation of images to attack deep image classification
models pose serious security concerns in practice, this paper suggests a novel
paradigm where the concept of image perturbation can benefit classification
performance, which we call amicable aid. We show that by taking the opposite
search direction of perturbation, an image can be modified to yield higher
classification confidence and even a misclassified image can be made correctly
classified. This can be also achieved with a large amount of perturbation by
which the image is made unrecognizable by human eyes. The mechanism of the
amicable aid is explained in the viewpoint of the underlying natural image
manifold. Furthermore, we investigate the universal amicable aid, i.e., a fixed
perturbation can be applied to multiple images to improve their classification
results. While it is challenging to find such perturbations, we show that
making the decision boundary as perpendicular to the image manifold as possible
via training with modified data is effective to obtain a model for which
universal amicable perturbations are more easily found.

					<dc:description>  Automatic vulnerability detection on C/C++ source code has benefitted from
the introduction of machine learning to the field, with many recent
publications targeting this combination. In contrast, assembly language or
machine code artifacts receive less attention, although there are compelling
reasons to study them. They are more representative of what is executed, more
easily incorporated in dynamic analysis, and in the case of closed-source code,
there is no alternative.
  We evaluate the representative capability of assembly language compared to
C/C++ source code for vulnerability detection. Furthermore, we investigate the
role of call graph context in detecting function-spanning vulnerabilities.
Finally, we verify whether compiling a benchmark dataset compromises an
experiment's soundness by inadvertently leaking label information.
  We propose ROMEO, a publicly available, reproducible and reusable binary
vulnerability detection benchmark dataset derived from the synthetic Juliet
test suite. Alongside, we introduce a simple text-based assembly language
representation that includes context for function-spanning vulnerability
detection and semantics to detect high-level vulnerabilities. It is constructed
by disassembling the .text segment of the respective binaries.
  We evaluate an x86 assembly language representation of the compiled dataset,
combined with an off-the-shelf classifier. It compares favorably to
state-of-the-art methods, including those operating on the full C/C++ code.
Including context information using the call graph improves detection of
function-spanning vulnerabilities. There is no label information leaked during
the compilation process.

					<dc:description>  Initially used to rank web pages, PageRank has now been applied in many
fields. In general case, there are plenty of special vertices such as dangling
vertices and unreferenced vertices in the graph. Existing PageRank algorithms
usually consider them as `bad` vertices since they may take troubles. However,
in this paper, we propose a parallel PageRank algorithm which can take
advantage of these special vertices. For this end, we firstly interpret
PageRank from the information transmitting perspective and give a constructive
definition of PageRank. Then, based on the information transmitting
interpretation, a parallel PageRank algorithm which we call the Information
Transmitting Algorithm(ITA) is proposed. We prove that the dangling vertices
can increase ITA's convergence rate and the unreferenced vertices and weak
unreferenced vertices can decrease ITA's calculations. Compared with the MONTE
CARLO method, ITA has lower bandwidth requirement. Compared with the power
method, ITA has higher convergence rate and generates less calculations.
Finally, experimental results on four data sets demonstrate that ITA is 1.5-4
times faster than the power method and converges more uniformly.

					<dc:description>  We demonstrate experimentally the realization and the characterization of a
chip scale integrated photodetector for the visible and the near infrared
spectral regime based on the integration of a MoSe2/WS2 heterojunction on top
of a silicon nitride waveguide. This configuration achieves high responsivity
of ~1 A/W at the wavelength of 780 nm (indicating an internal gain mechanism),
while suppressing the dark current to the level of ~50 pA, much lower as
compared to a reference sample of just MoSe2 without WS2. We have measured the
power spectral density of the dark current to be as low as ~1x10^-12 A/Hz^0.5 ,
from which we extract the noise equivalent power (NEP) to be ~1x10^-12
W/Hz^0.5. To demonstrate the usefulness of the device, we use it for the
characterization of the transfer function of a microring resonator that is
integrated on the same chip as the photodetector. The ability to integrate
local photodetectors on chip and to operate such devices with high performance
at the visible and the near-infrared regime is expected to play a critical role
in future integrated devices in the field of optical communications, quantum
photonics, biochemical sensing and more.

					<dc:description>  Entanglement resources can increase transmission rates substantially.
Unfortunately, entanglement is a fragile resource that is quickly degraded by
decoherence effects. In order to generate entanglement for optical
communication, the transmitter and the receiver first prepare entangled
spin-photon pairs locally, and then the photon at the transmitter is sent to
the receiver through an optical fiber or free space. Without feedback, the
transmitter does not know whether the entangled photon has reached the
receiver. The present work introduces a new model of unreliable entanglement
assistance, whereby the communication system operates whether entanglement
assistance is present or not. While the sender is ignorant, the receiver knows
whether the entanglement generation was successful. In the case of a failure,
the receiver decodes less information. In this manner, the effective
transmission rate is adapted according to the assistance status. Regularized
formulas are derived for the classical and quantum capacity regions with
unreliable entanglement assistance, characterizing the tradeoff between the
unassisted rate and the excess rate that can be obtained from entanglement
assistance. It is further established that time division between
entanglement-assisted and unassisted coding strategies is optimal for the
noiseless qubit channel, but can be strictly suboptimal for a noisy channel.

					<dc:description>  We describe a model for polarization in multi-agent systems based on Esteban
and Ray's standard family of polarization measures from economics. Agents
evolve by updating their beliefs (opinions) based on an underlying influence
graph, as in the standard DeGroot model for social learning, but under a
confirmation bias; i.e., a discounting of opinions of agents with dissimilar
views. We show that even under this bias polarization eventually vanishes
(converges to zero) if the influence graph is strongly-connected. If the
influence graph is a regular symmetric circulation, we determine the unique
belief value to which all agents converge. Our more insightful result
establishes that, under some natural assumptions, if polarization does not
eventually vanish then either there is a disconnected subgroup of agents, or
some agent influences others more than she is influenced. We also prove that
polarization does not necessarily vanish in weakly-connected graphs under
confirmation bias. Furthermore, we show how our model relates to the classic
DeGroot model for social learning. We illustrate our model with several
simulations of a running example about polarization over vaccines and of other
case studies. The theoretical results and simulations will provide insight into
the phenomenon of polarization.

					<dc:description>  $H_0$ constraints from galaxy surveys are sourced by the geometric properties
of two standardisable rulers: the sound horizon scale, $r_s$, and the
matter-radiation equality scale, $k_{\rm eq}$. While most analyses over the
last decade have focused on the first scale, recent work has emphasised that
the second can provide an independent source of information about the expansion
rate of the universe. Recent approaches to obtain a sound-horizon-independent
measurement of $H_0$ from the equality scale have avoided $r_s$-based
information by removing the sound-horizon-calibrating prior on the baryon
density. We present a new method to marginalise over $r_s$; this allows baryon
information to be retained enabling tighter parameter constraints. For a
Euclid-like spectroscopic survey, we forecast sound-horizon-independent $H_0$
constraints of $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.7\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ for our method
using the equality scale, compared with $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.5\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\
Mpc^{-1}}$ from the sound horizon. Upcoming equality scale $H_0$ measurements
thus can be highly competitive, although we caution that the impact of
observational systematics on such measurements still needs to be investigated
in detail. Applying our new approach to the BOSS power spectrum gives $H_0 =
69.5^{+3.0}_{-3.5}\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ from equality alone, somewhat
tighter than previous constraints. Consistency of $r_s$- and $k_{\rm eq}$-based
$H_0$ measurements can provide a valuable internal consistency test of the
cosmological model; as an example, we consider the change in $H_0$ created by
early dark energy. Assuming the \textit{Planck}+SH0ES best-fit EDE model we
find a $2.6\sigma$ shift ($\Delta H_0 = 2.6\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$)
between the two measurements for Euclid; if we instead assume the ACT best-fit
model, this increases to $9.0\sigma$ ($\Delta H_0 = 7.8\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\
Mpc^{-1}}$).

					<dc:description>  Poncelet's theorem states that if there exists an n-sided polygon which is
inscribed in a given conic C and circumscribed about another conic D, then
there are infinitely many such n-gons. Proofs of this theorem that we are aware
of, including Poncelet's original proof and the celebrated modern proof by
Griffiths and Harris, assume the two conics to be in general position (that is,
not tangent or at least not osculating), or be defined over the field of
complex numbers, or both. Here we show that Poncelet's theorem holds for any
two conics C and D in the projective plane over an algebraically closed field k
of any characteristic other than two. If C and D are osculating and char(k)&gt;2,
our result shows that there always exist infinitely many polygons of char(k)
sides that are inscribed in C and circumscribed about D. We also describe the
situation in characteristic two in the appendix.

					<dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to investigate the local and global comparison
of two $n$-variable generalized Bajraktarevi\'c means, i.e., to establish
necessary as well as sufficient conditions in terms of the unknown functions
$f,g,p_1,\dots,p_n,q_1,\dots,q_n:I\to\mathbb{R}$ for the comparison inequality
$$
f^{-1}\bigg(\frac{p_1(x_1)f(x_1)+\cdots+p_n(x_n)f(x_n)}{p_1(x_1)+\cdots+p_n(x_n)}\bigg)\leq
g^{-1}\bigg(\frac{q_1(x_1)g(x_1)+\cdots+q_n(x_n)g(x_n)}{q_1(x_1)+\cdots
+q_n(x_n)}\bigg) $$ in local and global sense. Here $I$ is a nonempty open real
interval, $x_1,\dots,x_n\in I$, and $f,g$ is assumed to be continuous, strictly
monotone and $p_1,\dots,p_n,q_1,\dots,q_n:I\to\mathbb{R}_+$ are positive
valued. Concerning the global comparison problem, the main result of the paper
states that if $f,g$ are differentiable functions with nonvanishing first
derivatives and, for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, $$
  \frac{p_i}{p_0}=\frac{q_i}{q_0} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
\frac{p_0(x)(f(x)-f(y))}{p_0(y)f'(y)}
\leq\frac{q_0(x)(g(x)-g(y))}{q_0(y)g'(y)}\qquad(x,y\in I) $$ are satisfied
(where $p_0:=p_1+\dots+p_n$ and $q_0:=q_1+\dots+q_n$), then the above
comparison inequality holds for all $x_1,\dots,x_n\in I$.

					<dc:title>Dijkstras algorithm with predictions to solve the single-source

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  We study the use of machine learning techniques to solve a fundamental
shortest path problem, known as the single-source many-targets shortest path
problem (SSMTSP). Given a directed graph with non-negative edge weights, our
goal is to compute a shortest path from a given source node to any of several
target nodes. Basically, our idea is to equip an adapted version of Dijkstras
algorithm with machine learning predictions to solve this problem: Based on the
trace of the algorithm, we design a neural network that predicts the shortest
path distance after a few iterations. The prediction is then used to prune the
search space explored by Dijkstras algorithm, which may significantly reduce
the number of operations on the underlying priority queue. We note that our
algorithm works independently of the specific method that is used to arrive at
such predictions. Crucially, we require that our algorithm always computes an
optimal solution (independently of the accuracy of the prediction) and provides
a certificate of optimality. As we show, in the worst-case this might force our
algorithm to use the same number of queue operations as Dijkstras algorithm,
even if the prediction is correct. In general, however, our algorithm may save
a significant fraction of the priority queue operations. We derive structural
insights that allow us to lower bound these savings on partial random
instances. In these instances, an adversary can fix the instance arbitrarily
except for the weights of a subset of relevant edges, which are chosen
randomly. Our bound shows that the number of relevant edges which are pruned
increases as the prediction error decreases. We then use these insights to
derive closed-form expressions of the expected number of saved queue operations
on random instances.

					<dc:creator>Ogasawara, Kota</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - General Economics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This study investigates the impact of coal mining on the regional economy in
industrializing Japan. By linking the location information of mines with
registration- and census-based statistics, I found that mines increased the
local population via internal migration. While the influx of migrants changed
the demographics, these reverted to trend as migrants formed their families.
This also led to a local structural shift from the primary to the production
and service sectors, depending on sex. I also found suggestive evidence that
the occupational hazards of female miners and not mining pollution increased
the risk of infant mortality via a mortality selection mechanism before birth.
However, further analysis suggests that these effects differ across the type of
mines: heavy metal mines had much smaller impacts on the local population and
labor supply, and rather improved early-life mortality.

					<dc:description>  Understanding and identifying different types of single molecules' diffusion
that occur in a broad range of systems (including living matter) is extremely
important, as it can provide information on the physical and chemical
characteristics of particles' surroundings. In recent years, an ever-growing
number of methods have been proposed to overcome some of the limitations of the
mean-squared displacements approach to tracer diffusion. In March 2020, the
Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge was launched by a community of
international scientists to provide a framework for an objective comparison of
the available methods for anomalous diffusion. In this paper, we introduce a
feature-based machine learning method developed in response to Task 2 of the
challenge, i.e. the classification of different types of diffusion. We discuss
two sets of attributes that may be used for the classification of
single-particle tracking data. The first one was proposed as our contribution
to the AnDi Challenge. The latter is the result of our attempt to improve the
performance of the classifier after the deadline of the competition. Extreme
gradient boosting was used as the classification model. Although the
deep-learning approach constitutes the state-of-the-art technology for data
classification in many domains, we deliberately decided to pick this
traditional machine learning algorithm due to its superior interpretability.
After the extension of the feature set our classifier achieved the accuracy of
0.83, which is comparable with the top methods based on neural networks.

					<dc:description>  The oscillation of a Laplacian eigenfunction gives a great deal of
information about the manifold on which it is defined. This oscillation can be
encoded in the nodal deficiency, an important geometric quantity that is
notoriously hard to compute, or even estimate. Here we compare two recently
obtained formulas for the nodal deficiency, one in terms of an energy
functional on the space of equipartitions of the manifold, and the other in
terms of a two-sided Dirichlet-to-Neumann map defined on the nodal set. We
relate these two approaches by giving an explicit formula for the Hessian of
the equipartition energy in terms of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This allows
us to compute Hessian eigenfunctions, and hence directions of steepest descent,
for the equipartition energy in terms of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann
eigenfunctions. Our results do not assume bipartiteness, and hence are relevant
to the study of spectral minimal partitions.

					<dc:description>  We present the extension of the SIBFA (Sum of Interactions Between Fragments
Ab initio Computed many-body polarizable force field to condensed phase
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The Quantum-Inspired SIBFA procedure is
grounded on simplified integrals obtained from localized molecular orbital
theory and achieves full separability of its intermolecular potential. It
embodies long-range multipolar electrostatics (up to quadrupole) coupled to a
short-range penetration correction (up to charge-quadrupole),
exchange-repulsion, many-body polarization, many-body charge
transfer/delocalization, exchange-dispersion and dispersion (up to C10). This
enables the reproduction of all energy contributions of ab initio
Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT(DFT)) gas phase reference
computations. The SIBFA approach has been integrated within the Tinker-HP
massively parallel MD package. To do so all SIBFA energy gradients have been
derived and the approach has been extended to enable periodic boundary
conditions simulations using Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald. This novel
implementation also notably includes a computationally tractable simplification
of the many-body charge transfer/delocalization contribution. As a proof of
concept, we perform a first computational experiment defining a water model
fitted on a limited set of (SAPT(DFT)) data. SIBFA is shown to enable a
satisfactory reproduction of both gas phase energetic contributions and
condensed phase properties highlighting the importance of its
physically-motivated functional form.

					<dc:description>  We provide Fourier expansions of vector-valued eigenfunctions of the
hyperbolic Laplacian that are twist-periodic in a horocycle direction. The
twist may be given by any endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space; no
assumptions on invertibility or unitarity are made. Examples of such
eigenfunctions include vector-valued twisted automorphic forms of Fuchsian
groups. We further provide a detailed description of the Fourier coefficients
and explicitly identify each of their constituents, which intimately depend on
the eigenvalues of the twisting endomorphism and the size of its Jordan blocks.
In addition, we determine the growth properties of the Fourier coefficients.

					<dc:description>  We study the compact support property for solutions of the following
stochastic partial differential equations: $$\partial_t u =
a^{ij}u_{x^ix^j}(t,x)+b^{i}u_{x^i}(t,x)+cu+h(t,x,u(t,x))\dot{F}(t,x),\quad
(t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times{\bf{R}}^d,$$ where $\dot{F}$ is a spatially
homogeneous Gaussian noise that is white in time and colored in space, and
$h(t, x, u)$ satisfies $K^{-1}|u|^{\lambda}\leq h(t, x, u)\leq K(1+|u|)$ for
$\lambda\in(0,1)$ and $K\geq 1$. We show that if the initial data $u_0\geq 0$
has a compact support, then, under the reinforced Dalang's condition on
$\dot{F}$ (which guarantees the existence and the H\&quot;older continuity of a weak
solution), all nonnegative weak solutions $u(t, \cdot)$ have the compact
support for all $t&gt;0$ with probability 1. Our results extend the works by
Mueller-Perkins [Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 93(3):325--358, 1992] and Krylov
[Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 108(4):543--557, 1997], in which they show the
compact support property only for the one-dimensional SPDEs driven by
space-time white noise on $(0, \infty)\times \bf{R}$.

					<dc:description>  There are two reasons why uncertainty about the future yield of investments
may not be adequately described by Probability Theory. The first one is due to
unique or nearly-unique events, that either never realized or occurred too
seldom for probabilities to be reliable. The second one arises when when one
fears that something may happen, that one is not even able to figure out, e.g.,
if one asks: &quot;Climate change, financial crises, pandemic, war, what next?&quot;
  In both cases, simple one-to-one causal mappings between available
alternatives and possible consequences eventually melt down. However, such
destructions reflect into the changing narratives of business executives,
employees and other stakeholders in specific, identifiable and differential
ways. In particular, texts such as consultants' reports or letters to
shareholders can be analysed in order to detect the impact of both sorts of
uncertainty onto the causal relations that normally guide decision-making.
  We propose structural measures of causal mappings as a means to measure
non-probabilistic uncertainty, eventually suggesting that automated text
analysis can greatly augment the possibilities offered by these techniques.
Prospective applications may concern statistical institutes, stock market
traders, as well as businesses wishing to compare their own vision to those
prevailing in their industry.

					<dc:description>  Traditional sociotechnical systems (STS) theory has been widely used, but
there are many new characteristics in the STS environment as we enter the
intelligence era, resulting in the limitations of traditional STS. Based on the
&quot;user-centered design&quot; philosophy, this paper proposes a new framework of
intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS) and outlines the new characteristics
of iSTS as well as its implications for the development of intelligent systems.
Future research of iSTS requires interdisciplinary collaboration, including
human factors engineering, this paper finally proposes suggestions from two
aspects of human factors engineering methodology and approaches.

					<dc:description>  O-RAN is a new, open, adaptive, and intelligent RAN architecture. Motivated
by the success of artificial intelligence in other domains, O-RAN strives to
leverage machine learning (ML) to automatically and efficiently manage network
resources in diverse use cases such as traffic steering, quality of experience
prediction, and anomaly detection. Unfortunately, it has been shown that
ML-based systems are vulnerable to an attack technique referred to as
adversarial machine learning (AML). This special kind of attack has already
been demonstrated in recent studies and in multiple domains. In this paper, we
present a systematic AML threat analysis for O-RAN. We start by reviewing
relevant ML use cases and analyzing the different ML workflow deployment
scenarios in O-RAN. Then, we define the threat model, identifying potential
adversaries, enumerating their adversarial capabilities, and analyzing their
main goals. Next, we explore the various AML threats associated with O-RAN and
review a large number of attacks that can be performed to realize these threats
and demonstrate an AML attack on a traffic steering model. In addition, we
analyze and propose various AML countermeasures for mitigating the identified
threats. Finally, based on the identified AML threats and countermeasures, we
present a methodology and a tool for performing risk assessment for AML attacks
for a specific ML use case in O-RAN.

					<dc:description>  Recently, minimax optimization received renewed focus due to modern
applications in machine learning, robust optimization, and reinforcement
learning. The scale of these applications naturally leads to the use of
first-order methods. However, the nonconvexities and nonconcavities present in
these problems, prevents the application of typical Gradient Descent-Ascent,
which is known to diverge even in bilinear problems. Recently, it was shown
that the Proximal Point Method (PPM) converges linearly for a family of
nonconvex-nonconcave problems. In this paper, we study the convergence of a
damped version of Extra-Gradient Method (EGM) which avoids potentially costly
proximal computations, only relying on gradient evaluation. We show that EGM
converges linearly for smooth minimax optimization problem satisfying the same
nonconvex-nonconcave condition needed by PPM.

					<dc:description>  The convex rope problem is to find a counterclockwise or clockwise convex
rope starting at the vertex a and ending at the vertex b of a simple polygon P,
where a is a vertex of the convex hull of P and b is visible from infinity. The
convex rope mentioned is the shortest path joining a and b that does not enter
the interior of P. In this paper, the problem is reconstructed as the one of
finding such shortest path in a simple polygon and solved by the method of
multiple shooting. We then show that if the collinear condition of the method
holds at all shooting points, then these shooting points form the shortest
path. Otherwise, the sequence of paths obtained by the update of the method
converges to the shortest path. The algorithm is implemented in C++ for
numerical experiments.

					<dc:description>  COVID-19 related deaths underestimate the pandemic burden on mortality
because they suffer from completeness and accuracy issues. Excess mortality is
a popular alternative, as it compares observed with expected deaths based on
the assumption that the pandemic did not occur. Expected deaths had the
pandemic not occurred depend on population trends, temperature, and
spatio-temporal patterns. In addition to this, high geographical resolution is
required to examine within country trends and the effectiveness of the
different public health policies. In this tutorial, we propose a framework
using R to estimate and visualise excess mortality at high geographical
resolution. We show a case study estimating excess deaths during 2020 in Italy.
The proposed framework is fast to implement and allows combining different
models and presenting the results in any age, sex, spatial and temporal
aggregation desired. This makes it particularly powerful and appealing for
online monitoring of the pandemic burden and timely policy making.

					<dc:description>  Recent work of the authors and their collaborators has uncovered fundamental
connections between the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, the spectral flow of a
certain family of self-adjoint operators, and the nodal deficiency of a
Laplacian eigenfunction (or an analogous deficiency associated to a
non-bipartite equipartition). Using a refined construction of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we strengthen all of these results, in particular
getting improved bounds on the nodal deficiency of degenerate eigenfunctions.
Our framework is very general, allowing for non-bipartite partitions,
non-simple eigenvalues, and non-smooth nodal sets. Consequently, the results
can be used in the general study of spectral minimal partitions, not just nodal
partitions of generic Laplacian eigenfunctions.

					<dc:description>  Image reconstruction based on indirect, noisy, or incomplete data remains an
important yet challenging task. While methods such as compressive sensing have
demonstrated high-resolution image recovery in various settings, there remain
issues of robustness due to parameter tuning. Moreover, since the recovery is
limited to a point estimate, it is impossible to quantify the uncertainty,
which is often desirable. Due to these inherent limitations, a sparse Bayesian
learning approach is sometimes adopted to recover a posterior distribution of
the unknown. Sparse Bayesian learning assumes that some linear transformation
of the unknown is sparse. However, most of the methods developed are tailored
to specific problems, with particular forward models and priors. Here, we
present a generalized approach to sparse Bayesian learning. It has the
advantage that it can be used for various types of data acquisitions and prior
information. Some preliminary results on image reconstruction/recovery indicate
its potential use for denoising, deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging.

					<dc:description>  Boasting supreme magnetic strengths, magnetars are among the prime candidates
to generate fast radio bursts. Several theories have been proposed for the
formation mechanism of magnetars, but have not yet been fully tested. As
different magnetar formation theories expect distinct magnetar space velocity
distributions, high-precision astrometry of Galactic magnetars can serve as a
probe for the formation theories. In addition, magnetar astrometry can refine
the understanding of the distribution of Galactic magnetars. This distribution
can be compared against fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized in spiral galaxies,
in order to test the link between FRBs and magnetars. Swift J1818.0-1607 is the
hitherto fastest-spinning magnetar and the fifth discovered radio magnetar. In
an ongoing astrometric campaign, we have observed Swift J1818.0-1607 for one
year using the Very Long Baseline Array, and have determined a precise proper
motion as well as a tentative parallax for the magnetar.

					<dc:description>  This contribution features an accelerated computation of the Sinkhorn's
algorithm, which approximates the Wasserstein transportation distance, by
employing nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms (NFFT). The algorithm proposed
allows approximations of the Wasserstein distance by involving not more than
$\mathcal O(n\log n)$ operations for probability measures supported by~$n$
points. Furthermore, the proposed method avoids expensive allocations of the
characterizing matrices. With this numerical acceleration, the transportation
distance is accessible to probability measures out of reach so far. Numerical
experiments using synthetic and real data affirm the computational advantage
and superiority.

					<dc:description>  Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers are one of the most widely-used blockchain
privacy solutions, operating on top of smart contract-enabled blockchains. We
find that ZKP mixers are tightly intertwined with the growing number of
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks and Blockchain Extractable Value (BEV)
extractions. Through coin flow tracing, we discover that 205 blockchain
attackers and 2,595 BEV extractors leverage mixers as their source of funds,
while depositing a total attack revenue of 412.87M USD. Moreover, the US OFAC
sanctions against the largest ZKP mixer, Tornado.Cash, have reduced the mixer's
daily deposits by more than 80%.
  Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called
anonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among
a set of k other users. Through empirical measurements, we, however, find that
these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate. For the most popular mixers
on Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), we show how to reduce the
anonymity set size on average by 27.34% and 46.02% respectively. Our empirical
evidence is also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users
on ETH and BSC.
  State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem
by offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary
rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we
find that AM does not necessarily improve the quality of a mixer's anonymity
set. Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do
not contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.

					<dc:description>  In this note, we study a degenerate twisted J-flow on compact K\&quot;ahler
manifolds. We show that it exists for all time, it is unique and converges to a
weak solution of a degenerate twisted J-equation. In particular, this confirms
an expectation formulated by Song-Weinkove for the J-flow. As a consequence, we
establish the properness of the Mabuchi K-energy twisted by a certain
semi-positive closed (1,1)-form for K\&quot;ahler classes in a certain subcone.

					<dc:description>  We consider the effect of time-periodic forcing on a one-dimensional
Schr{\&quot;o}dinger equation with a topologically protected defect (edge) mode. The
unforced system models a domain-wall or dislocation defect in a periodic
structure, and it supports a defect mode which bifurcates from the Dirac point
(linear band crossing) of the underlying bulk medium. We study the robustness
of this state against time-periodic forcing of the type that arises in the
study of Floquet Topological Insulators in condensed matter, photonics, and
cold-atoms systems. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that under
time-periodic forcing of sufficiently high frequency, the defect state
undergoes radiative leakage of its energy away from the interface into the
bulk; the time-decay is exponential on a time-scale proportional to the inverse
square of the forcing amplitude. The envelope dynamics of our Floquet system
are approximately governed, on long time scales, by an effective (homogenized)
periodically-forced Dirac equation. Multiple scale analysis of the effective
envelope dynamics yields an expansion of the radiating solution, which shows
excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.

					<dc:description>  We propose a connection between 3d-5d exponential networks and exact WKB for
difference equations associated to five dimensional Seiberg-Witten curves, or
equivalently, to quantum mirror curves to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds $X$: the
singularities in the Borel planes of local solutions to such difference
equations correspond to central charges of 3d-5d BPS KK-modes, and the central
charges of 5d BPS KK-modes are related to the singularities in the Borel planes
of the closed topological string free energy on $X$. It follows that there
should be distinguished local solutions of the difference equation in each
domain of the complement of the exponential network, and these solutions jump
at the walls of the network. We verify this picture in detail in two simple
examples of 3d-5d systems, corresponding to taking the toric Calabi-Yau $X$ to
be either $\mathbb{C}^3$ or the resolved conifold. We provide the full list of
local solutions in each sector of the Borel plane and in each domain of the
complement of the exponential network, and find that local solutions in
disconnected domains correspond to non-perturbative open topological string
amplitudes on $X$ with insertions of branes at different positions of the toric
diagram. We also study the Borel summation of the closed refined topological
string free energy on $X$ and the corresponding non-perturbative effects.

					<dc:description>  We establish a family of uncertainty principles for finite linear
combinations of Hermite functions. More precisely, we give a geometric
criterion on a subset $S\subset \RR^d$ ensuring that the $L^2$-seminorm
associated to $S$ is equivalent to the full $L^2$-norm on $\RR^d$ when
restricted to the space of Hermite functions up to a given degree. We give
precise estimates how the equivalence constant depends on this degree and on
geometric parameters of $S$. From these estimates we deduce that the parabolic
equation whose generator is the harmonic oscillator is null-controllable from
$S$.
  In all our results, the set $S$ may have sub-exponentially decaying density
and, in particular, finite volume. We also show that bounded sets are not
efficient in this context.

					<dc:description>  Currently available quantum computers, so called Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, are characterized by relatively low number of qubits
and moderate gate fidelities. In such scenario, the implementation of quantum
error correction is impossible and the performance of those devices is quite
modest. In particular, the depth of circuits implementable with reasonably high
fidelity is limited, and the minimization of circuit depth is required. Such
depths depend on the efficiency of the universal set of gates $\mathcal{S}$
used in computation, and can be bounded using the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.
However, it is known that much better, asymptotically tight bounds of the form
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{log}(\epsilon^{-1}))$, can be obtained for specific
$\mathcal{S}$. Those bounds are controlled by so called spectral gap, denoted
$\mathrm{gap}(\mathcal{S})$. Yet, the computation of
$\mathrm{gap}(\mathcal{S})$ is not possible for general $\mathcal{S}$ and in
practice one considers spectral gap at a certain scale $r(\epsilon)$, denoted
$\mathrm{gap}_r(\mathcal{S})$. This turns out to be sufficient to bound the
efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ provided that one is interested in a physically
feasible case, in which an error $\epsilon$ is bounded from below. In this
paper we derive lower bounds on $\mathrm{gap}_r(\mathcal{S})$ and, as a
consequence, on the efficiency of universal sets of $d$-dimensional quantum
gates $\mathcal{S}$ satisfying an additional condition. The condition is
naturally met for generic quantum gates, such as e.g. Haar random gates. Our
bounds are explicit in the sense that all parameters can be determined by
numerical calculations on existing computers, at least for small $d$. This is
in contrast with known lower bounds on $\mathrm{gap}_r(\mathcal{S})$ which
involve parameters with ambiguous values.

					<dc:description>  Point cloud models with neural network architectures have achieved great
success and have been widely used in safety-critical applications, such as
Lidar-based recognition systems in autonomous vehicles. However, such models
are shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks which aim to apply stealthy
semantic transformations such as rotation and tapering to mislead model
predictions. In this paper, we propose a transformation-specific smoothing
framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable robustness guarantees for
point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks. We first categorize
common 3D transformations into three categories: additive (e.g., shearing),
composable (e.g., rotation), and indirectly composable (e.g., tapering), and we
present generic robustness certification strategies for all categories
respectively. We then specify unique certification protocols for a range of
specific semantic transformations and their compositions. Extensive experiments
on several common 3D transformations show that TPC significantly outperforms
the state of the art. For example, our framework boosts the certified accuracy
against twisting transformation along z-axis (within 20$^\circ$) from 20.3$\%$
to 83.8$\%$. Codes and models are available at
https://github.com/Qianhewu/Point-Cloud-Smoothing.

					<dc:description>  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods form one of the algorithmic
foundations of Bayesian inverse problems. The recent development of
likelihood-informed subspace (LIS) methods offers a viable route to designing
efficient MCMC methods for exploring high-dimensional posterior distributions
via exploiting the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the underlying
inverse problem. However, existing LIS methods and the associated performance
analysis often assume that the prior distribution is Gaussian. This assumption
is limited for inverse problems aiming to promote sparsity in the parameter
estimation, as heavy-tailed priors, e.g., Laplace distribution or the elastic
net commonly used in Bayesian LASSO, are often needed in this case. To overcome
this limitation, we consider a prior normalization technique that transforms
any non-Gaussian (e.g. heavy-tailed) priors into standard Gaussian
distributions, which makes it possible to implement LIS methods to accelerate
MCMC sampling via such transformations. We also rigorously investigate the
integration of such transformations with several MCMC methods for
high-dimensional problems. Finally, we demonstrate various aspects of our
theoretical claims on two nonlinear inverse problems.

					<dc:description>  Action Units (AU) are muscular activations used to describe facial
expressions. Therefore accurate AU recognition unlocks unbiaised face
representation which can improve face-based affective computing applications.
From a learning standpoint AU detection is a multi-task problem with strong
inter-task dependencies. To solve such problem, most approaches either rely on
weight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the joint
task distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields
comprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an
arbitrary order into an unordered task set. Crucially, this ordering choice has
been identified as a source of performance variations. In this paper, we
present Multi-Order Network (MONET), a multi-task method with joint task order
optimization. MONET uses a differentiable order selection to jointly learn
task-wise modules with their optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce
warmup and order dropout to enhance order selection by encouraging order
exploration. Experimentally, we first demonstrate MONET capacity to retrieve
the optimal order in a toy environment. Second, we validate MONET architecture
by showing that MONET outperforms existing multi-task baselines on multiple
attribute detection problems chosen for their wide range of dependency
settings. More importantly, we demonstrate that MONET significantly extends
state-of-the-art performance in AU detection.

					<dc:description>  Active quantum error correction is a central ingredient to achieve robust
quantum processors. In this paper we investigate the potential of quantum
machine learning for quantum error correction in a quantum memory.
Specifically, we demonstrate how quantum neural networks, in the form of
quantum autoencoders, can be trained to learn optimal strategies for active
detection and correction of errors, including spatially correlated
computational errors as well as qubit losses. We highlight that the denoising
capabilities of quantum autoencoders are not limited to the protection of
specific states but extend to the entire logical codespace. We also show that
quantum neural networks can be used to discover new logical encodings that are
optimally adapted to the underlying noise. Moreover, we find that, even in the
presence of moderate noise in the quantum autoencoders themselves, they may
still be successfully used to perform beneficial quantum error correction and
thereby extend the lifetime of a logical qubit.

					<dc:title>Tailoring Gradient Methods for Differentially-Private Distributed

					<dc:description>  Decentralized optimization is gaining increased traction due to its
widespread applications in large-scale machine learning and multi-agent
systems. The same mechanism that enables its success, i.e., information sharing
among participating agents, however, also leads to the disclosure of individual
agents' private information, which is unacceptable when sensitive data are
involved. As differential privacy is becoming a de facto standard for privacy
preservation, recently results have emerged integrating differential privacy
with distributed optimization. However, directly incorporating differential
privacy design in existing distributed optimization approaches significantly
compromises optimization accuracy. In this paper, we propose to redesign and
tailor gradient methods for differentially-private distributed optimization,
and propose two differential-privacy oriented gradient methods that can ensure
both rigorous epsilon-differential privacy and optimality. The first algorithm
is based on static-consensus based gradient methods, and the second algorithm
is based on dynamic-consensus (gradient-tracking) based distributed
optimization methods and, hence, is applicable to general directed interaction
graph topologies. Both algorithms can simultaneously ensure almost sure
convergence to an optimal solution and a finite privacy budget, even when the
number of iterations goes to infinity. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that both goals are achieved simultaneously. Numerical simulations using a
distributed estimation problem and experimental results on a benchmark dataset
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

					<dc:description>  Online tree-based search algorithms iteratively simulate trajectories and
update action-values for a set of states stored in a tree structure. It works
reasonably well in practice but fails to effectively utilise the information
gathered from similar states. Depending upon the smoothness of the action-value
function, one approach to overcoming this issue is through online learning,
where information is interpolated among similar states; Policy Gradient Search
provides a practical algorithm to achieve this. However, Policy Gradient Search
lacks an explicit exploration mechanism, which is a key feature of tree-based
online search algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective
online search algorithm called Exploratory Policy Gradient Search (ExPoSe),
which leverages information sharing among states by updating the search policy
parameters directly, while incorporating a well-defined exploration mechanism
during the online search process. We evaluate ExPoSe on a range of
decision-making problems, including Atari games, Sokoban, and Hamiltonian cycle
search in sparse graphs. The results demonstrate that ExPoSe consistently
outperforms other popular online search algorithms across all domains. The
ExPoSe source code is available at

					<dc:description>  In recent years, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has undergone several
breakthroughs and advancements, leading to a leap in performance. Today,
performance is no longer a major barrier to adoption. Instead, it is the
complexity of developing an efficient FHE application that currently limits
deploying FHE in practice and at scale. Several FHE compilers have emerged
recently to ease FHE development. However, none of these answer how to
automatically transform imperative programs to secure and efficient FHE
implementations. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed before
we can realistically expect broader use of FHE. Automating these
transformations is challenging because the restrictive set of operations in FHE
and their non-intuitive performance characteristics require programs to be
drastically transformed to achieve efficiency. Moreover, existing tools are
monolithic and focus on individual optimizations. Therefore, they fail to fully
address the needs of end-to-end FHE development. In this paper, we present
HECO, a new end-to-end design for FHE compilers that takes high-level
imperative programs and emits efficient and secure FHE implementations. In our
design, we take a broader view of FHE development, extending the scope of
optimizations beyond the cryptographic challenges existing tools focus on.

					<dc:description>  While deep learning based image retrieval is reported to be vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, existing works are mainly on image-to-image retrieval with
their attacks performed at the front end via query modification. By contrast,
we present in this paper the first study about a threat that occurs at the back
end of a text-to-image retrieval (T2IR) system. Our study is motivated by the
fact that the image collection indexed by the system will be regularly updated
due to the arrival of new images from various sources such as web crawlers and
advertisers. With malicious images indexed, it is possible for an attacker to
indirectly interfere with the retrieval process, letting users see certain
images that are completely irrelevant w.r.t. their queries. We put this thought
into practice by proposing a novel Trojan-horse attack (THA). In particular, we
construct a set of Trojan-horse images by first embedding word-specific
adversarial information into a QR code and then putting the code on benign
advertising images. A proof-of-concept evaluation, conducted on two popular
T2IR datasets (Flickr30k and MS-COCO), shows the effectiveness of the proposed
THA in a white-box mode.

					<dc:description>  Successful detection of gravitational waves has presented a new avenue to
explore the nature of gravity. With the cumulative catalog of detected events,
we can perform tests on General Relativity from various aspects with increasing
precision. In this work, we focus on Lorentz symmetry during propagation of
gravitational waves. Considering the dispersion relation in the gauge-invariant
linearized gravity sector of the Standard-Model Extension, the anisotropy,
birefringence, and dispersion effects will be induced during propagation of
gravitational waves because of the Lorentz violating modification, and cause
dephasings in waveform received by detectors. With the distorted waveform, we
perform full Bayesian inference with confident events in the last gravitational
wave catalog. We consider two cases associated with the lowest mass dimension
$d=5,6$ which are supposed to have the most significant effects, and place the
constraints on the expansion coefficients characterizing the Lorentz violating
behavior which have 16 independent components for $d=5$ and 18 components for
$d=6$. We do not find any evidence for Lorentz violation in the gravitational
wave data, the constraints on the coefficients are on the order of
$10^{-15}{\rm m}$ for $d=5$ and $10^{-10}{\rm m^2}$ for $d=6$ respectively.

					<dc:description>  We propose a gate to switch superconducting qubit pairs in and out of a
two-body interaction. This gate uses cross resonance driving on a tunable
circuit with adjusted parameters and without accumulating residual ZZ
interaction for idle and interacting qubits. It is imperative that this gate
does not spread errors through the quantum register. Our detailed theoretical
results show that these error-free modes do not necessarily require largely
tunable circuits, such as magnetic modulation of qubits or couplers. We obtain
the operational gate on weakly tuneable circuits as well and show that
switching between them is remarkably fast.

$x_n]_d$ be a vector space, and $A$ be a compact semialgebraic subset of
$\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{R}}^{n-1}$. We shall study some PSD cones $\mathcal{P} =
\mathcal{P}(A$, $\mathcal{H}) := \big\{f \in \mathcal{H}$ $\big|$ $f(a) \geq 0$

elements of $\mathcal{P}$, (2) to determine discriminants of $\mathcal{P}$, (3)
to describe $\mathcal{P}$ as a union of basic semialgebraic subsets, and (4) to
find a nice test set when $\dim \mathcal{H}$ is low. In this article, we
present (1), (2), (3) and (4) for $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^4$,
$\mathcal{H}_{4,4}^{s0})$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}_+^4$,
$\mathcal{H}_{4,4}^{s0})$, where $\mathcal{H}_{n,d}^{s0} := \big\{f \in

					<dc:description>  We introduce and study the new combinatorial class of Dyck paths with air
pockets. We exhibit a bijection with the peakless Motzkin paths which
transports several pattern statistics and give bivariate generating functions
for the distribution of patterns as peaks, returns and pyramids. Then, we
deduce the popularities and asymptotic expectations of these patterns and point
out a link between the popularity of pyramids and a special kind of closed
smooth self-overlapping curves, a subset of Fibonacci meanders. A similar study
is conducted for non-decreasing Dyck paths with air pockets.

					<dc:description>  Advances producing and measuring orbital angular momentum (OAM) in free
particles has led to substantial interest across fields. Here, we exploit
conserved helicity inherent in twisted photoelectrons from a chiral target to
propose a new ultrafast chiral imaging technique, dubbed photoelectron vortex
dichroism (PEVD). We theoretically demonstrate huge forward-backwards asymmetry
in OAM-resolved photoelectron emission, sensitive to molecular chirality, for
electrons ionized by strong linearly polarized fields averaged over the carrier
envelope phase. Using a chiral combination of hydrogenic states reveals the
fundamental mechanism for PEVD through OAM dependent asymmetry in the initial
state.

					<dc:description>  Large language models (LMs) have been shown to memorize parts of their
training data, and when prompted appropriately, they will emit the memorized
training data verbatim. This is undesirable because memorization violates
privacy (exposing user data), degrades utility (repeated easy-to-memorize text
is often low quality), and hurts fairness (some texts are memorized over
others).
  We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which
LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we
increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has
been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the
model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes more complicated when
generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that
memorization in LMs is more prevalent than previously believed and will likely
get worse as models continues to scale, at least without active mitigations.

					<dc:description>  Binary trust-region steepest descent (BTR) and combinatorial integral
approximation (CIA) are two recently investigated approaches for the solution
of optimization problems with distributed binary-/discrete-valued variables
(control functions). We show improved convergence results for BTR by imposing a
compactness assumption that is similar to the convergence theory of CIA. As a
corollary we conclude that BTR also constitutes a descent algorithm on the
continuous relaxation and its iterates converge weakly-$^*$ to stationary
points of the latter. We provide computational results that validate our
findings. In addition, we observe a regularizing effect of BTR, which we
explore by means of a hybridization of CIA and BTR.

					<dc:description>  Breakthrough experiments have newly explored the fascinating physics of
dipolar quantum droplets and supersolids. The recent realization of dipolar
mixtures opens further intriguing possibilities. We show that under rather
general conditions, the presence of a second component catalyzes droplet
nucleation and supersolidity in an otherwise unmodulated condensate. Droplet
catalyzation in miscible mixtures, which may occur even for a surprisingly
small impurity doping, results from a local roton instability triggered by the
doping-dependent modification of the effective dipolar strength. The
catalyzation mechanism may trigger the formation of a two-fluid supersolid,
characterized by a generally different superfluid fraction of each component,
which opens intriguing possibilities for the future study of spin physics in
dipolar supersolids.

					<dc:description>  Differentially private GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) have been recently
studied to provide high accuracy in various tasks on graph data while strongly
protecting user privacy. In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm to
protect each user's feature vector in an attributed graph with LDP (Local
Differential Privacy), a strong privacy notion without a trusted third party.
However, this algorithm does not protect edges (friendships) in a social graph
or protect user privacy in unattributed graphs. How to strongly protect edges
with high accuracy in GNNs remains open.
  In this paper, we propose a novel LDP algorithm called the DPRR
(Degree-Preserving Randomized Response) to provide LDP for edges in GNNs. Our
DPRR preserves each user's degree hence a graph structure while providing edge
LDP. Technically, we use Warner's RR (Randomized Response) and strategic edge
sampling, where each user's sampling probability is automatically tuned to
preserve the degree information. We prove that the DPRR approximately preserves
the degree information under edge LDP. We focus on graph classification as a
task of GNNs and evaluate the DPRR using four social graph datasets. Our
experimental results show that the DPRR significantly outperforms three
baselines and provides accuracy close to a non-private algorithm in all
datasets with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., epsilon=1.

					<dc:description>  Cosmological phase transitions can proceed via the nucleation of bubbles that
subsequently expand and collide. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum
depends crucially on the properties of these bubbles. We extend our previous
holographic work on planar bubbles to circular bubbles in a strongly-coupled,
non-Abelian, four-dimensional gauge theory. This extension brings about two new
physical properties. First, the existence of a critical bubble, which we
determine. Second, the bubble profile at late times exhibits a richer
self-similar structure, which we verify. These results require a new 3+1
evolution code called Jecco that solves the Einstein equations in the
characteristic formulation in asymptotically AdS spaces. Jecco is written in
the Julia programming language and is freely available. We present an outline
of the code and the tests performed to assess its robustness and performance.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a sketching algorithm for constructing a tensor
train representation of a probability density from its samples. Our method
deviates from the standard recursive SVD-based procedure for constructing a
tensor train. Instead, we formulate and solve a sequence of small linear
systems for the individual tensor train cores. This approach can avoid the
curse of dimensionality that threatens both the algorithmic and sample
complexities of the recovery problem. Specifically, for Markov models, we prove
that the tensor cores can be recovered with a sample complexity that scales
logarithmically in the dimensionality. Finally, we illustrate the performance
of the method with several numerical experiments.

					<dc:description>  In the last ten years, various automated machine learning (AutoM ) systems
have been proposed to build end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipelines with
minimal human interaction. Even though such automatically synthesized ML
pipelines are able to achieve a competitive performance, recent studies have
shown that users do not trust models constructed by AutoML due to missing
transparency of AutoML systems and missing explanations for the constructed ML
pipelines. In a requirements analysis study with 36 domain experts, data
scientists, and AutoML researchers from different professions with vastly
different expertise in ML, we collect detailed informational needs for AutoML.
We propose XAutoML, an interactive visual analytics tool for explaining
arbitrary AutoML optimization procedures and ML pipelines constructed by
AutoML. XAutoML combines interactive visualizations with established techniques
from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make the complete AutoML
procedure transparent and explainable. By integrating XAutoML with JupyterLab,
experienced users can extend the visual analytics with ad-hoc visualizations
based on information extracted from XAutoML. We validate our approach in a user
study with the same diverse user group from the requirements analysis. All
participants were able to extract useful information from XAutoML, leading to a
significantly increased understanding of ML pipelines produced by AutoML and
the AutoML optimization itself.

					<dc:description>  Premixed turbulent flames, encountered in power generation and propulsion
engines, are an archetype of a randomly advected, self-propagating surface.
While such a flame is known to exhibit large-scale intermittent flapping, the
possible intermittency of its small-scale fluctuations has been largely
disregarded. Here, we experimentally reveal the inner intermittency of a
premixed turbulent V-flame, while clearly distinguishing this small-scale
feature from large-scale outer intermittency. From temporal measurements of the
fluctuations of the flame, we find a frequency spectrum that has a power-law
subrange with an exponent close to $-2$, which is shown to follow from
Kolmogorov phenomenology. Crucially, however, the moments of the temporal
increment of the flame position are found to scale anomalously, with exponents
that saturate at higher-orders. This signature of small-scale inner
intermittency is shown to originate from high-curvature, cusp-like structures
on the flame surface, which have significance for modeling the heat release
rate and other key properties of premixed turbulent flames.

					<dc:description>  State of the art legged robots are either capable of measuring torque at the
output of their drive systems, or have transparent drive systems which enable
the computation of joint torques from motor currents. In either case, this
sensor modality is seldom used in state estimation. In this paper, we propose
to use joint torque measurements to estimate the centroidal states of legged
robots. To do so, we project the whole-body dynamics of a legged robot into the
nullspace of the contact constraints, allowing expression of the dynamics
independent of the contact forces. Using the constrained dynamics and the
centroidal momentum matrix, we are able to directly relate joint torques and
centroidal states dynamics. Using the resulting model as the process model of
an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), we fuse the torque measurement in the
centroidal state estimation problem. Through real-world experiments on a
quadruped robot with different gaits, we demonstrate that the estimated
centroidal states from our torque-based EKF drastically improve the recovery of
these quantities compared to direct computation.

					<dc:description>  Grasping has long been considered an important and practical task in robotic
manipulation. Yet achieving robust and efficient grasps of diverse objects is
challenging, since it involves gripper design, perception, control and
learning, etc. Recent learning-based approaches have shown excellent
performance in grasping a variety of novel objects. However, these methods
either are typically limited to one single grasping mode, or else more end
effectors are needed to grasp various objects. In addition, gripper design and
learning methods are commonly developed separately, which may not adequately
explore the ability of a multimodal gripper. In this paper, we present a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to achieve multistage hybrid robotic
grasping with a new soft multimodal gripper. A soft gripper with three grasping
modes (i.e., enveloping, sucking, and enveloping_then_sucking) can both deal
with objects of different shapes and grasp more than one object simultaneously.
We propose a novel hybrid grasping method integrated with the multimodal
gripper to optimize the number of grasping actions. We evaluate the DRL
framework under different scenarios (i.e., with different ratios of objects of
two grasp types). The proposed algorithm is shown to reduce the number of
grasping actions (i.e., enlarge the grasping efficiency, with maximum values of
161% in simulations and 154% in real-world experiments) compared to single
grasping modes.

					<dc:title>Automation of reversible steganographic coding with nonlinear discrete

					<dc:description>  Authentication mechanisms are at the forefront of defending the world from
various types of cybercrime. Steganography can serve as an authentication
solution through the use of a digital signature embedded in a carrier object to
ensure the integrity of the object and simultaneously lighten the burden of
metadata management. Nevertheless, despite being generally imperceptible to
human sensory systems, any degree of steganographic distortion might be
inadmissible in fidelity-sensitive situations such as forensic science, legal
proceedings, medical diagnosis and military reconnaissance. This has led to the
development of reversible steganography. A fundamental element of reversible
steganography is predictive analytics, for which powerful neural network models
have been effectively deployed. Another core element is reversible
steganographic coding. Contemporary coding is based primarily on heuristics,
which offers a shortcut towards sufficient, but not necessarily optimal,
capacity--distortion performance. While attempts have been made to realise
automatic coding with neural networks, perfect reversibility is unattainable
via such learning machinery. Instead of relying on heuristics and machine
learning, we aim to derive optimal coding by means of mathematical
optimisation. In this study, we formulate reversible steganographic coding as a
nonlinear discrete optimisation problem with a logarithmic capacity constraint
and a quadratic distortion objective. Linearisation techniques are developed to
enable iterative mixed-integer linear programming. Experimental results
validate the near-optimality of the proposed optimisation algorithm when
benchmarked against a brute-force method.

					<dc:description>  This work studies the adversarial robustness of parametric functions composed
of a linear predictor and a non-linear representation map. % that satisfies
certain stability condition. Our analysis relies on \emph{sparse local
Lipschitzness} (SLL), an extension of local Lipschitz continuity that better
captures the stability and reduced effective dimensionality of predictors upon
local perturbations. SLL functions preserve a certain degree of structure,
given by the sparsity pattern in the representation map, and include several
popular hypothesis classes, such as piece-wise linear models, Lasso and its
variants, and deep feed-forward \relu networks. % are sparse local Lipschitz.
We provide a tighter robustness certificate on the minimal energy of an
adversarial example, as well as tighter data-dependent non-uniform bounds on
the robust generalization error of these predictors. We instantiate these
results for the case of deep neural networks and provide numerical evidence
that supports our results, shedding new insights into natural regularization
strategies to increase the robustness of these models.

					<dc:description>  The prediction accuracy of machine learning methods is steadily increasing,
but the calibration of their uncertainty predictions poses a significant
challenge. Numerous works focus on obtaining well-calibrated predictive models,
but less is known about reliably assessing model calibration. This limits our
ability to know when algorithms for improving calibration have a real effect,
and when their improvements are merely artifacts due to random noise in finite
datasets. In this work, we consider detecting mis-calibration of predictive
models using a finite validation dataset as a hypothesis testing problem. The
null hypothesis is that the predictive model is calibrated, while the
alternative hypothesis is that the deviation from calibration is sufficiently
large.
  We find that detecting mis-calibration is only possible when the conditional
probabilities of the classes are sufficiently smooth functions of the
predictions. When the conditional class probabilities are H\&quot;older continuous,
we propose T-Cal, a minimax optimal test for calibration based on a debiased
plug-in estimator of the $\ell_2$-Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We further
propose Adaptive T-Cal, a version that is adaptive to unknown smoothness. We
verify our theoretical findings with a broad range of experiments, including
with several popular deep neural net architectures and several standard
post-hoc calibration methods. T-Cal is a practical general-purpose tool, which
-- combined with classical tests for discrete-valued predictors -- can be used
to test the calibration of virtually any probabilistic classification method.

minima of a cost function in finite-dimensional settings. We introduce the
symplectic asymptotic convergence analysis for the Whiplash system for convex
functions. We also introduce relaxation sequences to explain the non-classical
nature of the algorithm and an exploring heuristic variant of the Whiplash
algorithm to escape saddle points, deterministically. We study the algorithm's
performance for various costs and provide a practical methodology for analyzing
convergence rates using integral constraint bounds and a novel Lyapunov rate
method. Our results demonstrate polynomial and exponential rates of convergence
for quadratic cost functions.

					<dc:description>  This paper focuses on the analysis of an optimal control problem governed by
a nonsmooth quasilinear partial differential equation that models a stationary
incompressible shear-thickening fluid. We start by studying the directional
differentiability of the non-smooth term within the state equation as a prior
step to demonstrate the directional differentiability of the solution operator.
Thereafter, we establish a primal first order necessary optimality condition
(Bouligand (B) stationarity), which is derived from the directional
differentiability of the solution operator. By using a local regularization of
the nonsmooth term and carrying out an asymptotic analysis thereafter, we
rigourously derive a weak stationarity system for local minima. By combining
the B- and weak stationarity conditions, and using the regularity of the
Lagrange multiplier, we are able to obtain a strong stationarity system that
includes an inequality for the scalar product between the symmetrized gradient
of the state and the Lagrange multiplier.

					<dc:description>  Despite excellent performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image
classification, detection, and prediction, characterizing how DNNs make a given
decision remains an open problem, resulting in a number of interpretability
methods. Post-hoc interpretability methods primarily aim to quantify the
importance of input features with respect to the class probabilities. However,
due to the lack of ground truth and the existence of interpretability methods
with diverse operating characteristics, evaluating these methods is a crucial
challenge. A popular approach to evaluate interpretability methods is to
perturb input features deemed important for a given prediction and observe the
decrease in accuracy. However, perturbation itself may introduce artifacts,
since perturbed images may be out-of-distribution (OOD). In this paper, we have
conducted computational experiments to estimate the contribution of
perturbation artifacts and developed a method to estimate the fidelity of
interpretability methods. We demonstrate that, while perturbation artifacts
indeed exist, we can minimize and characterize their impact on fidelity
estimation by utilizing model accuracy curves from perturbing input features
according to the Most Import First (MIF) and Least Import First (LIF) orders.
Using the ResNet-50 trained on the ImageNet, we demonstrate the proposed
fidelity estimation of four popular post-hoc interpretability methods.

					<dc:description>  We consider the system of quantum differential equations for a partial flag
variety and construct a basis of solutions in the form of multidimensional
hypergeometric functions, that is, we construct a Landau-Ginzburg mirror for
that partial flag variety. In our construction, the solutions are labeled by
elements of the $K$-theory algebra of the partial flag variety.
  To establish these facts we consider the equivariant quantum differential
equations for a partial flag variety and introduce a compatible system of
difference equations, which we call the qKZ equations. We construct a basis of
solutions of the joint system of the equivariant quantum differential equations
and qKZ difference equations in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric
functions. Then the facts about the non-equivariant quantum differential
equations are obtained from the facts about the equivariant quantum
differential equations by a suitable limit.
  Analyzing these constructions we obtain a formula for the fundamental Levelt
solution of the quantum differential equations for a partial flag variety.

					<dc:description>  Much of our understanding of the physical properties of raft domains in
biological membranes, and some insight into the mechanisms underlying their
formation stem from atomistic simulations of simple model systems, especially
ternary mixtures consisting of saturated and unsaturated lipids, and
cholesterol (Chol). To explore the properties of such systems at large spatial
scales, we here present a simple ternary mixture lattice model, involving a
small number of nearest neighbor interaction terms. Monte Carlo simulations of
mixtures with different compositions show an excellent agreement with
experimental and atomistic simulation observations across multiple scale,
ranging from the local distributions of lipids to the phase diagram of the
system. The simplicity of the model allows us to identify the roles played by
the different interactions between components, and the interplay between them.
Importantly, by changing the value of one of the model parameters, we can tune
the size of the liquid-ordered domains, thereby to simulate both Type II
mixtures exhibiting macroscopic phase separation and Type I mixtures with
nanoscopic domains. The Type II mixture simulation results fit well to the
experimentally-determined phase diagram of mixtures containing saturated
DPPC/unsaturated DOPC/Chol. When the tunable parameter is changed, we obtain
the Type I version of DPPC/DOPC/Chol, i.e., a mixture not showing thermodynamic
phase transitions but one that may be fitted to the same phase diagram if local
measures are used to distinguish between the different states. Our model
results suggest that short range packing is likely to be a key regulator of the
stability and size distribution of biological rafts.

					<dc:title>Numerical and kodaira dimensions of cotangent bundles</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Campana, Frederic Bruno</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Algebraic Geometry</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Complex Variables</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We conjecture the equality of the numerical and Kodaira dimensions
$\nu_1^*(X)$ and $\kappa_1^*(X)$ for the cotangent bundle of compact K\&quot;ahler
manifolds $X$, generalising the classical case of the canonical bundle. We show
or reduce it to the classical case of the canonical bundle for some peculiar
manifolds: among them, the rationally connected ones, or resolutions of
varieties with klt singularities and trivial first Chern class, in which case
we show that $\nu_1^*(X)=\kappa_1^*(X)=q'(X)-dim(X)$, where $q'(X)$ is the
maximal irregularity of a finite \'etale cover of $X$. The proof rests on the
Beauville-Bogomolov decomposition, and a direct computation for smooth models
of quotients $A/G$ of complex tori by finite groups. We conjecture that these
equalities hold true, much more generally, when $X$ is `special'. The invariant
$\kappa_1^*$ was already introduced and studied by Fumio Sakai in [43], the
particular case of the preceding conjecture when $\kappa_1^*(X)=-dim(X)$ was
introduced and studied in [29].

					<dc:description>  Machine learning interatomic force fields are promising for combining high
computational efficiency and accuracy in modeling quantum interactions and
simulating atomistic dynamics. Active learning methods have been recently
developed to train force fields efficiently and automatically. Among them,
Bayesian active learning utilizes principled uncertainty quantification to make
data acquisition decisions. In this work, we present a general Bayesian active
learning workflow, where the force field is constructed from a sparse Gaussian
process regression model based on atomic cluster expansion descriptors. To
circumvent the high computational cost of the sparse Gaussian process
uncertainty calculation, we formulate a high-performance approximate mapping of
the uncertainty and demonstrate a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We
demonstrate the autonomous active learning workflow by training a Bayesian
force field model for silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs in only a few days of
computer time and show that pressure-induced phase transformations are
accurately captured. The resulting model exhibits close agreement with both
\textit{ab initio} calculations and experimental measurements, and outperforms
existing empirical models on vibrational and thermal properties. The active
learning workflow readily generalizes to a wide range of material systems and
accelerates their computational understanding.

					<dc:description>  A compressible viscous-dispersive Euler system in one space dimension in the
context of quantum hydrodynamics is considered. The dispersive term is due to
quantum effects described through the Bohm potential and the viscosity term is
of linear type. It is shown that small-amplitude viscous-dispersive shock
profiles for the system under consideration are spectrally stable, proving in
this fashion a previous numerical observation by Lattanzio et al. (Phys. D 402,
2020, p. 132222; Appl. Math. Comput. 385, 2020, p. 125450). The proof is based
on spectral energy estimates which profit from the monotonicty of the profiles
in the small-amplitude regime.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a novel study of parameter-free attentive scoring for
speaker verification. Parameter-free scoring provides the flexibility of
comparing speaker representations without the need of an accompanying
parametric scoring model. Inspired by the attention component in Transformer
neural networks, we propose a variant of the scaled dot product attention
mechanism to compare enrollment and test segment representations. In addition,
this work explores the effect on performance of (i) different types of
normalization, (ii) independent versus tied query/key estimation, (iii) varying
the number of key-value pairs and (iv) pooling multiple enrollment utterance
statistics. Experimental results for a 4 task average show that a simple
parameter-free attentive scoring mechanism can improve the average EER by 10%
over the best cosine similarity baseline.

					<dc:description>  [abridged] Probing the faint end of the number counts at mm wavelengths is
important to identify the origin of the extragalactic background light in this
regime. Aided by strong gravitational lensing, ALMA observations towards
massive galaxy clusters have opened a window to disentangle this origin,
allowing to resolve sub-mJy dusty star-forming galaxies. We aim to derive
number counts at 1.1 mm down to flux densities fainter than 0.1 mJy, based on
ALMA observations towards five Hubble Frontier Fields (FF) galaxy clusters,
following a statistical approach to correct for lensing effects. We created a
source catalog that includes 29 ALMA 1.1 mm continuum detections down to a
4.5sigma significance. We derived source intrinsic flux densities using public
lensing models. We folded the uncertainties in both magnifications and source
redshifts into the number counts through Monte Carlo simulations. We derive
cumulative number counts over two orders of magnitude down to 0.01 mJy after
correction for lensing effects. Cosmic variance estimates are all exceeded by
uncertainties in our median combined cumulative counts that come from both our
Monte Carlo simulations and Poisson statistics. Our number counts are
consistent to 1sigma with most of recent ALMA estimates and galaxy evolution
models. However, below 0.1 mJy, they are lower by 0.4 dex compared to two deep
ALMA studies but consistent with ASPECS-LP to 1sigma. Importantly, the
flattening found for our cumulative counts extends further to 0.01 mJy. Our
results bring further support in line of the flattening of the number counts
reported previously by us and ASPECS-LP, which has been interpreted by a recent
galaxy evolution model as a measurement of the &quot;knee&quot; of the infrared
luminosity function at high redshift. Our estimates of the contribution to the
EBL in the FFs suggest that we may be resolving most of the EBL at 1.1mm down
to 0.01 mJy.

					<dc:title>Conservative Filtering for Heterogeneous Decentralized Data Fusion in

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a method for Bayesian multi-robot peer-to-peer data
fusion where any pair of autonomous robots hold non-identical, but overlapping
parts of a global joint probability distribution, representing real world
inference tasks (e.g., mapping, tracking). It is shown that in dynamic
stochastic systems, filtering, which corresponds to marginalization of past
variables, results in direct and hidden dependencies between variables not
mutually monitored by the robots, which might lead to an overconfident fused
estimate. The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions by
providing (i) a rigorous analysis of the origin of the dependencies and and
(ii) a conservative filtering algorithm for heterogeneous data fusion in
dynamic systems that can be integrated with existing fusion algorithms. This
work uses factor graphs as an analysis tool and an inference engine. Each robot
in the network maintains a local factor graph and communicates only relevant
parts of it (a sub-graph) to its neighboring robot. We discuss the
applicability to various multi-robot robotic applications and demonstrate the
performance using a multi-robot multi-target tracking simulation, showing that
the proposed algorithm produces conservative estimates at each robot.

					<dc:description>  Marine debris is a problem both for the health of marine environments and for
the human health since tiny pieces of plastic called &quot;microplastics&quot; resulting
from the debris decomposition over the time are entering the food chain at any
levels. For marine debris detection and removal, autonomous underwater vehicles
(AUVs) are a potential solution. In this letter, we focus on the efficiency of
AUV vision for real-time and low-light object detection. First, we improved the
efficiency of a class of state-of-the-art object detectors, namely
EfficientDets, by 1.5% AP on D0, 2.6% AP on D1, 1.2% AP on D2 and 1.3% AP on D3
without increasing the GPU latency. Subsequently, we created and made publicly
available a dataset for the detection of in-water plastic bags and bottles and
trained our improved EfficientDets on this and another dataset for marine
debris detection. Finally, we investigated how the detector performance is
affected by low-light conditions and compared two low-light underwater image
enhancement strategies both in terms of accuracy and latency. Source code and
dataset are publicly available.

					<dc:description>  We analyze offshore wind speeds with a time resolution of one second over a
long period of 20 months for different heights above the sea level. Power
spectra extending over more than seven decades give a comprehensive picture of
wind fluctuations, including intermittency effects at small length scales and
synoptic weather phenomena at large scales. The spectra $S(f)$ show a scaling
behavior consistent with three-dimensional turbulence at high frequencies $f$,
followed by a regime at lower frequencies, where $fS(f)$ varies weakly.
Lowering the frequency below a crossover frequency $f_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle
2D}$, a rapid rise of $fS(f)$ occurs. An analysis of the third-order structure
function $D_3(\tau)$ of wind speed differences for a given time lag $\tau$
shows a rapid change from negative to positive values of $D_3(\tau)$ at
$\tau\simeq 1/f_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle 2D}$. Remarkably, after applying
Taylor's hypothesis locally, we find the third-order structure function to
exhibit a behavior very similar to that obtained previously from aircraft
measurements at much higher altitudes in the atmosphere. In particular, the
third-order structure function grows linearly with the separation distance for
negative $D_3$, and with the third power for positive $D_3$. This allows us to
estimate energy and enstrophy dissipation rates for offshore wind. The
crossover from negative to positive values occurs at about the same separation
distance of 400 km as found from the aircraft measurements, suggesting that
this length is independent of the altitude in the atmosphere.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the tetragonal phase of the binary transition metal oxide CuO
(t-CuO) within the context of cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Due to its
strong antiferromagnetic correlations and simple structure, analysing the
physics of t-CuO is of high interest as it may pave the way towards a more
complete understanding of high temperature superconductivity in hole-doped
antiferromagnets. In this work we give a formal justification for the weak
coupling assumption that has previously been made for the interconnected
sublattices within a single layer of t-CuO by studying the non-local
self-energies of the system. We compute momentum-resolved spectral functions
using a Matrix Product State (MPS)-based impurity solver directly on the real
axis, which does not require any numerically ill-conditioned analytic
continuation. The agreement with photoemission spectroscopy indicates that a
single band Hubbard model is sufficient to capture the material's low energy
physics. We perform calculations on a range of different temperatures, finding
two magnetic regimes, for which we identify the driving mechanism behind their
respective insulating state. Finally, we show that in the hole-doped regime the
sublattice structure of t-CuO has interesting consequences on the symmetry of
the superconducting state.

					<dc:description>  We study the non-perturbative quantum geometry of the open and closed
topological string on the resolved conifold and its mirror. Our tools are
finite difference equations in the open and closed string moduli and the
resurgence analysis of their formal power series solutions. In the closed
setting, we derive new finite difference equations for the refined partition
function as well as its Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit. We write down a
distinguished analytic solution for the refined difference equation that
reproduces the expected non-perturbative content of the refined topological
string. We compare this solution to the Borel analysis of the free energy in
the NS limit. We find that the singularities of the Borel transform lie on
infinitely many rays in the Borel plane and that the Stokes jumps across these
rays encode the associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the underlying
Calabi-Yau geometry. In the open setting, the finite difference equation
corresponds to a canonical quantization of the mirror curve. We analyze this
difference equation using Borel analysis and exact WKB techniques and identify
the 5d BPS states in the corresponding exponential spectral networks. We
furthermore relate the resurgence analysis in the open and closed setting. This
guides us to a five-dimensional extension of the Nekrasov-Rosly-Shatashvili
proposal, in which the NS free energy is computed as a generating function of
$q$-difference opers in terms of a special set of spectral coordinates.
Finally, we examine two spectral problems describing the corresponding quantum
integrable system.

					<dc:description>  The exponentially large discrete search space in mixed-precision quantization
(MPQ) makes it hard to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer. Previous
works usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which
consume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that
some unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in
the quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the
contribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These
importance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during
quantization-aware training, which can precisely provide quantization
sensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always contains hundreds
of such indicators, and training them one by one would lead to an excessive
time cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training scheme that can
obtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the indicators
training process by parallelizing the original sequential training processes.
With these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ search problem
as a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That avoids the
iterative search and significantly reduces search time without limiting the
bit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with our indicators
takes only 0.06 s, which improves time efficiency exponentially compared to
iterative search methods. Also, extensive experiments show our approach can
achieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with various
constraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate). Code is available on

					<dc:description>  Common image-to-image translation methods rely on joint training over data
from both source and target domains. The training process requires concurrent
access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection;
and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain
pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation
method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs.
Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained
independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain
latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then
decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both
steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process
is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers.
Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and
latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal
transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply
DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their
utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal
transport properties.

					<dc:title>GPU Computation of the Euler Characteristic Curve for Imaging Data</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Persistent homology is perhaps the most popular and useful tool offered by
topological data analysis, with point-cloud data being the most common setup.
Its older cousin, the Euler characteristic curve (ECC) is less expressive, but
far easier to compute. It is particularly suitable for analyzing imaging data,
and is commonly used in fields ranging from astrophysics to biomedical image
analysis. These fields are embracing GPU computations to handle increasingly
large datasets. We therefore propose an optimized GPU implementation of ECC
computation for 2D and 3D grayscale images. The goal of this paper is twofold.
First, we offer a practical tool, illustrating its performance with thorough
experimentation, but also explain its inherent shortcomings. Second, this
simple algorithm serves as a perfect backdrop for highlighting basic GPU
programming techniques that make our implementation so efficient, and some
common pitfalls we avoided. This is intended as a step towards a wider usage of
GPU programming in computational geometry and topology software. We find this
is particularly important as geometric and topological tools are used in
conjunction with modern, GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks.

					<dc:description>  Monocular 3D motion capture (mocap) is beneficial to many applications. The
use of a single camera, however, often fails to handle occlusions of different
body parts and hence it is limited to capture relatively simple movements. We
present a light-weight, hybrid mocap technique called HybridCap that augments
the camera with only 4 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in a
learning-and-optimization framework. We first employ a weakly-supervised and
hierarchical motion inference module based on cooperative Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) blocks that serve as limb, body and root trackers as well as an inverse
kinematics solver. Our network effectively narrows the search space of
plausible motions via coarse-to-fine pose estimation and manages to tackle
challenging movements with high efficiency. We further develop a hybrid
optimization scheme that combines inertial feedback and visual cues to improve
tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate
HybridCap can robustly handle challenging movements ranging from fitness
actions to Latin dance. It also achieves real-time performance up to 60 fps
with state-of-the-art accuracy.

					<dc:description>  Recently, the PHENIX Collaboration has published second- and third-harmonic
Fourier coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ for midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;0.35$) charged
hadrons in 0\%--5\% central $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV utilizing three sets of two-particle correlations
for two detector combinations with different pseudorapidity acceptance [Phys.
Rev. C {\bf 105}, 024901 (2022)]. This paper extends these measurements of
$v_2$ to all centralities in $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, as
well as $p$$+$$p$ collisions, as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and
event multiplicity. The kinematic dependence of $v_2$ is quantified as the
ratio $R$ of $v_2$ between the two detector combinations as a function of event
multiplicity for $0.5$$&lt;$$p_T$$&lt;$$1$ and $2$$&lt;$$p_T$$&lt;$$2.5$ GeV/$c$. A
multiphase-transport (AMPT) model can reproduce the observed $v_2$ in
most-central to midcentral $d$$+$Au and $^3$He$+$Au collisions. However, the
AMPT model systematically overestimates the measurements in $p$$+$$p$,
$p$$+$Au, and peripheral $d$$+$Au and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, indicating a
higher nonflow contribution in AMPT than in the experimental data. The AMPT
model fails to describe the observed $R$ for $0.5$$&lt;$$p_T$$&lt;$$1$ GeV/$c$, but
there is qualitative agreement with the measurements for $2$$&lt;$$p_T$$&lt;$$2.5$
GeV/$c$.

					<dc:title>Interval Dominance based Structural Results for Markov Decision Process</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Krishnamurthy, Vikram</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Structural results impose sufficient conditions on the model parameters of a
Markov decision process (MDP) so that the optimal policy is an increasing
function of the underlying state. The classical assumptions for MDP structural
results require supermodularity of the rewards and transition probabilities.
However, supermodularity does not hold in many applications. This paper uses a
sufficient condition for interval dominance (called I) proposed in the
microeconomics literature, to obtain structural results for MDPs under more
general conditions. We present several MDP examples where supermodularity does
not hold, yet I holds, and so the optimal policy is monotone; these include
sigmoidal rewards (arising in prospect theory for human decision making),
bi-diagonal and perturbed bi-diagonal transition matrices (in optimal
allocation problems). We also consider MDPs with TP3 transition matrices and
concave value functions. Finally, reinforcement learning algorithms that
exploit the differential sparse structure of the optimal monotone policy are
discussed.

					<dc:description>  Given a prime number $p$, we study topological analogues of Iwasawa
invariants associated to $\mathbb{Z}_p$-covers of the $3$-sphere that are
branched along a link. We prove explicit criteria to detect these Iwasawa
invariants, and apply them to the study of links consisting of $2$ component
knots. Fixing the prime $p$, we prove statistical results for the average
behaviour of $p$-primary Iwasawa invariants for $2$-bridge links that are in
Schubert normal form. Our main result, which is entirely unconditional, shows
that the density of $2$-bridge links for which the $\mu$-invariant vanishes,
and the $\lambda$-invariant is equal to $1$, is $(1-\frac{1}{p})$. We also
conjecture that the density of $2$-bridge links for which the $\mu$-invariant
vanishes is $1$, and this is significantly backed by computational evidence.
Our results are proven in a topological setting, yet have arithmetic
significance, as we set out new directions in arithmetic statistics and
arithmetic topology.

					<dc:description>  As accelerator-neutrino oscillation experiments improve oscillation parameter
constraints, control over systematic uncertainties on the incoming neutrino
flux and interaction models is increasingly important. The intense beams
offered by modern experiments permit a variety of options to constrain the flux
using in situ &quot;standard candle&quot; measurements. These standard candles must use
very well understood processes to avoid introducing bias. One option discussed
in this context is the &quot;low-$\nu$&quot; method, designed to isolate neutrino
interactions where there is low energy-transfer to the nucleus, such that the
cross section is expected to be approximately constant as a function of
neutrino energy. The shape of the low-energy transfer event sample can then be
used to extract the flux shape. Applications of the method at high neutrino
energies (many tens of GeV) are well understood. However, the applicability of
the method at the few-GeV energies of current and future accelerator neutrino
experiments remains unclear due to the presence of nuclear and form-factor
effects.
  In this analysis we examine the prospects for improving constraints on
accelerator neutrino fluxes with the low-$\nu$ method in an
experiment-independent way, using (anti)neutrino interactions on argon and
hydrocarbon targets from the GENIE, NEUT, NuWro and GiBUU event generators. The
results show that flux constraints from the low-$\nu$ method would be severely
dependent on the specific interaction model assumptions used in an analysis for
neutrino energies less than 5 GeV. The spread of model predictions show that a
low-$\nu$ analysis is unlikely to offer much improvement on typical neutrino
flux uncertainties, even with a perfect detector. Notably -- running counter to
the assumption inherent to the low-$\nu$ method -- the model-dependence
increases with decreasing energy transfer for experiments in the few-GeV
region.

					<dc:description>  SLOPE is a popular method for dimensionality reduction in the
high-dimensional regression. Indeed some regression coefficient estimates of
SLOPE can be null (sparsity) or can be equal in absolute value (clustering).
Consequently, SLOPE may eliminate irrelevant predictors and may identify groups
of predictors having the same influence on the vector of responses. The notion
of SLOPE pattern allows to derive theoretical properties on sparsity and
clustering by SLOPE. Specifically, the SLOPE pattern of a vector provides: the
sign of its components (positive, negative or null), the clusters (indices of
components equal in absolute value) and clusters ranking. In this article we
give a necessary and sufficient condition for SLOPE pattern recovery of an
unknown vector of regression coefficients.

					<dc:title>Quantum dynamics is not strictly bidivisible</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Davalos, David</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We address the question of the existence of quantum channels that are
divisible in two quantum channels but not in three or, more generally, channels
divisible in $n$ but not in $n+1$ parts. We show that for the qubit those
channels \textit{do not} exist, whereas for general finite-dimensional quantum
channels the same holds at least for full Kraus rank channels. To prove these
results, we introduce a novel decomposition of quantum channels which separates
them into a boundary and Markovian part, and it holds for any finite dimension.
Additionally, the introduced decomposition amounts to the well-known connection
between divisibility classes and implementation types of quantum dynamical
maps, and can be used to implement quantum channels using smaller quantum
registers.

					<dc:description>  Disentangled representation is a powerful technique to tackle domain shift
problem in medical image analysis in unsupervised domain adaptation
setting.However, previous methods only focus on exacting domain-invariant
feature and ignore whether exacted feature is meaningful for downstream
tasks.We propose a novel framework, called semantic-guided disentangled
representation (SGDR), an effective method to exact semantically meaningful
feature for segmentation task to improve performance of cross modality medical
image segmentation in unsupervised domain adaptation setting. To exact the
meaningful domain-invariant features of different modality, we introduce a
content discriminator to force the content representation to be embedded to the
same space and a feature discriminator to exact the meaningful
representation.We also use pixel-level annotations to guide the encoder to
learn features that are meaningful for segmentation task.We validated our
method on two public datasets and experiment results show that our approach
outperforms the state of the art methods on two evaluation metrics by a
significant margin.

					<dc:description>  The trade-off between throughput and image quality is an inherent challenge
in microscopy. To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image
signals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a
regularized inverse problem. Compared to traditional regularizers, Deep
Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image
quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the
compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising
the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose
differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\partial \mu$) which
includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical
parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse
model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal
compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we
performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope
configurations. We show that learned sampling encodes important information
about the specimens in the illumination field of the microscope allowing higher
compression up to $\times 1024$. We further utilize our framework for Task
Aware Compression. The experimental results show superior performance on the
cell segmentation task.

					<dc:description>  GC-rich sequences are recurring motifs in oncogenes and retroviruses, and
could be targeted by non-covalent major-groove therapeutic ligands. We
considered the palindromic sequence d(G1G2C3G4C5C6)2, and designed several
oligopeptide derivatives of the anti-cancer intercalator mitoxantrone. The
stability of their complexes with a 18-mer oligonucleotide encompassing this
sequence in its center was validated using polarizable molecular dynamics. We
report the most salient structural features of two novel compounds, having a
dialkylammonium group as a side-chain on both arms. The anthraquinone ring is
intercalated in the central d(CpG)2 sequence with its long axis perpendicular
to that of the two base-pairs. On each strand, this enables each ammonium group
to bind in-register to O6/N7 of the two facing G bases upstream. We
subsequently designed tris-intercalating derivatives, each dialkylammonium
substituted with a connector to an N9-aminoacridine intercalator extending our
target range from six- to a ten-base pair palindromic sequence,
d(C1G2G3G4C5G6C7C8C9G10)2. The structural features of the complex of the most
promising derivative are reported. The present design strategy paves the way
for designing intercalator-oligopeptide derivatives with an even higher
selectivity, targeting an increased number of DNA bases, going beyond ten.

					<dc:description>  Since 2016, deep learning (DL) has advanced tomographic imaging with
remarkable successes, especially in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
imaging. Despite being driven by big data, the LDCT denoising and pure
end-to-end reconstruction networks often suffer from the black box nature and
major issues such as instabilities, which is a major barrier to apply deep
learning methods in low-dose CT applications. An emerging trend is to integrate
imaging physics and model into deep networks, enabling a hybridization of
physics/model-based and data-driven elements. In this paper, we systematically
review the physics/model-based data-driven methods for LDCT, summarize the loss
functions and training strategies, evaluate the performance of different
methods, and discuss relevant issues and future directions

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we derive explicit second-order necessary and sufficient
optimality conditions of a local minimizer to an optimal control problem for a
quasilinear second-order partial differential equation with a piecewise smooth
but not differentiable nonlinearity in the leading term. The key argument rests
on the analysis of level sets of the state. Specifically, we show that if a
function vanishes on the boundary and its the gradient is different from zero
on a level set, then this set decomposes into finitely many closed simple
curves. Moreover, the level sets depend continuously on the functions defining
these sets. We also prove the continuity of the integrals on the level sets. In
particular, Green's first identity is shown to be applicable on an open set
determined by two functions with nonvanishing gradients. In the second part to
this paper, the explicit sufficient second-order conditions will be used to
derive error estimates for a finite-element discretization of the control
problem.

					<dc:title>Deep neural networks for solving large linear systems arising from

					<dc:creator>Ng, Michael K.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper studies deep neural networks for solving extremely large linear
systems arising from highdimensional problems. Because of the curse of
dimensionality, it is expensive to store both the solution and right-hand side
vector in such extremely large linear systems. Our idea is to employ a neural
network to characterize the solution with much fewer parameters than the size
of the solution under a matrix-free setting. We present an error analysis of
the proposed method, indicating that the solution error is bounded by the
condition number of the matrix and the neural network approximation error.
Several numerical examples from partial differential equations, queueing
problems, and probabilistic Boolean networks are presented to demonstrate that
the solutions of linear systems can be learned quite accurately.

					<dc:creator>Hamma, Alioscia</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work, we show how the resource theory of nonstabilizerness quantifies
the hardness of direct fidelity estimation protocols. In particular, the
resources needed for a direct fidelity estimation conducted on generic states,
such as Pauli fidelity estimation and shadow fidelity estimation protocols,
grow exponentially with the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Remarkably, these
protocols are shown to be feasible only for those states that are useless to
attain any quantum speedup or advantage. This result suggests the impossibility
of estimating efficiently fidelity for generic states and, at the same time,
leaves the window open to those protocols specialized at directly estimating
the fidelity of particular states. We then extend our results to quantum
evolutions, showing that the resources needed to certify the quality of the
implementation of a given unitary $U$ are governed by the nonstabilizerness in
the Choi state associated with $U$, which is shown to possess a profound
connection with out-of-time order correlators.

					<dc:description>  Neural network language models can serve as computational hypotheses about
how humans process language. We compared the model-human consistency of diverse
language models using a novel experimental approach: controversial sentence
pairs. For each controversial sentence pair, two language models disagree about
which sentence is more likely to occur in natural text. Considering nine
language models (including n-gram, recurrent neural networks, and transformer
models), we created hundreds of such controversial sentence pairs by either
selecting sentences from a corpus or synthetically optimizing sentence pairs to
be highly controversial. Human subjects then provided judgments indicating for
each pair which of the two sentences is more likely. Controversial sentence
pairs proved highly effective at revealing model failures and identifying
models that aligned most closely with human judgments. The most
human-consistent model tested was GPT-2, although experiments also revealed
significant shortcomings of its alignment with human perception.

					<dc:description>  Despite recent improvements in computer vision, artificial visual systems'
design is still daunting since an explanation of visual computing algorithms
remains elusive. Salient object detection is one problem that is still open due
to the difficulty of understanding the brain's inner workings. Progress on this
research area follows the traditional path of hand-made designs using
neuroscience knowledge. In recent years two different approaches based on
genetic programming appear to enhance their technique. One follows the idea of
combining previous hand-made methods through genetic programming and fuzzy
logic. The other approach consists of improving the inner computational
structures of basic hand-made models through artificial evolution. This
research work proposes expanding the artificial dorsal stream using a recent
proposal to solve salient object detection problems. This approach uses the
benefits of the two main aspects of this research area: fixation prediction and
detection of salient objects. We decided to apply the fusion of visual saliency
and image segmentation algorithms as a template. The proposed methodology
discovers several critical structures in the template through artificial
evolution. We present results on a benchmark designed by experts with
outstanding results in comparison with the state-of-the-art.

					<dc:description>  A bipartite system whose subsystems are fully quantum chaotic and coupled by
a perturbative interaction with a tunable strength is a paradigmatic model for
investigating how isolated quantum systems relax towards an equilibrium. It is
found that quantum coherence of the initial product states in the uncoupled
eigenbasis can be viewed as a resource for equilibration and approach to
thermalization as manifested by the entanglement. Results are given for four
distinct perturbation strength regimes, the ultra-weak, weak, intermediate, and
strong regimes. For each, three types of initially unentangled states are
considered, coherent random-phase superpositions, random superpositions, and
eigenstate products. A universal time scale is identified involving the
interaction strength parameter. Maximally coherent initial states thermalize
for any perturbation strength in spite of the fact that in the ultra-weak
perturbative regime the underlying eigenstates of the system have a tensor
product structure and are not at all thermal-like; though the time taken to
thermalize tends to infinity as the interaction vanishes. In contrast to the
widespread linear behavior, in this regime the entanglement initially grows
quadratically in time.

					<dc:description>  We perform a multifractal analysis of homological growth rates of oriented
geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces. Our main result provides a formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of level sets of prescribed growth rates in terms of a
generalized Poincar\'e exponent of the Fuchsian group. We employ symbolic
dynamics developed by Bowen and Series, ergodic theory and thermodynamic
formalism to prove the analyticity of the dimension spectrum.

					<dc:title>Measuring the primordial curvature perturbations from the scalar induced

					<dc:creator>Li, Jun</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The scalar induced gravitational waves are produced from primordial curvature
perturbations in the second order of perturbations. We constrain the fractional
energy density of scalar induced gravitational waves from gravitational waves
observations. If there is no detection of the scalar induced gravitational
waves, the fractional energy density of scalar induced gravitational waves is
constrained by some upper limits. Depends on these upper limits, we can obtain
the constraints on the power spectrum of the primordial curvature
perturbations. For a power-law scalar power spectrum, the constraints on the
power spectrum are affected by adding the upper limit of scalar induced
gravitational waves from Square Kilometer Array (SKA). In the standard model,
the mean values of the scalar amplitude and the spectral index shift to lower
values when SKA is added to the combination of Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets, namely
$\ln(10^{10}A_s)=3.038\pm0.013$ and $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ at $68\%$
confidence level. We also consider the effects of the existing ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors, the existing Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and
Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), while the
constraints from CMB+BAO datasets are totally within their upper limits of
scalar induced gravitational waves. Furthermore, we characterize the scalar
fluctuation spectrum in terms of the spectral index $n_s$ and its first two
derivatives. We calculate corresponding power spectrum of scalar induced
gravitational waves theoretically and give the constraints on the running of
the spectral index and the running of the running of the spectral index.

					<dc:description>  Let $\mathcal A$ be a free hyperplane arrangement. In 1989, Ziegler showed
that the restriction $\mathcal A''$ of $\mathcal A$ to any hyperplane endowed
with the natural multiplicity $\kappa$ is then a free multiarrangement
$(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$. The aim of this paper is to prove an analogue of
Ziegler's theorem for the stronger notion of inductive freeness: if $\mathcal
A$ is inductively free, then so is the multiarrangement $(\mathcal
A'',\kappa)$. In a related result we derive that if a deletion $\mathcal A'$ of
$\mathcal A$ is free and the corresponding restriction $\mathcal A''$ is
inductively free, then so is $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$ -- irrespective of the
freeness of $\mathcal A$. In addition, we show counterparts of the latter kind
for additive and recursive freeness.

					<dc:title>Relaxed constant positive linear dependence constraint qualification for

					<dc:creator>Xu, Mengwei</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Ye, Jane J.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The disjunctive system is a system involving a disjunctive set which is the
union of finitely many polyhedral convex sets. In this paper, we introduce a
notion of the relaxed constant positive linear dependence constraint
qualification (RCPLD) for the disjunctive system. For a disjunctive system, our
notion is weaker than the one we introduced for a more general system recently
(J. Glob. Optim. 2020) and is still a constraint qualification. To obtain the
local error bound for the disjunctive system, we introduce the piecewise RCPLD
under which the error bound property holds if all inequality constraint
functions are subdifferentially regular and the rest of the constraint
functions are smooth. We then specialize our results to the ortho-disjunctive
program, which includes the mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
(MPEC), the mathematical program with vanishing constraints (MPVC) and the
mathematical program with switching constraints (MPSC) as special cases. For
MPEC, we recover MPEC-RCPLD, an MPEC variant of RCPLD and propose the MPEC
piecewise RCPLD to obtain the {error bound property}. For MPVC, we introduce
new constraint qualifications MPVC-RCPLD and the piecewise RCPLD, which also
implies the local error bound. For MPSC, we show that both RCPLD and the
piecewise RCPLD coincide and hence it leads to the local error bound.

					<dc:description>  We find the form of all non-closed Lorentzian Weyl structures $(M,c,\nabla)$
with recurrent curvature tensor. If the dimension of the manifold is bigger
than 3, then the conformal structure is flat, and the recurrent Weyl structure
is determined by a single function of one variable. The recurrent curvature
tensor turns out to be weighted parallel, i.e., the obtained spaces provide
certain generalization of locally symmetric affine spaces for the Weyl
geometry.

					<dc:title>A note on the dilation of a certain family of tetrablock contractions</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>47A20, 47A13</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We find an explicit tetrablock isometric dilation for every member
$(A_\alpha, B, P)$ of a family of tetrablock contractions indexed by a
parameter $\alpha$ in the closed unit disc (only the first operator of the
tetrablock contraction depends on the parameter). The dilation space is the
same for any member of the family. Explicit dilation for the adjoint tetrablock
contraction $(A_\alpha^*, B^*, P^*)$ for every member of the family mentioned
above is constructed as well. This example is important because it has been
claimed in the literature that this example does not have a dilation. Taking
cue from this construction and using Toeplitz operators on $H^2_{\mathbb
D}(\mathcal D_P)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a
tetrablock contraction to have a certain type of tetrablock isometric dilation.

					<dc:title>How Sampling Impacts the Robustness of Stochastic Neural Networks</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>D&#xe4;ubener, Sina</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Fischer, Asja</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Stochastic neural networks (SNNs) are random functions whose predictions are
gained by averaging over multiple realizations. Consequently, a gradient-based
adversarial example is calculated based on one set of samples and its
classification on another set. In this paper, we derive a sufficient condition
for such a stochastic prediction to be robust against a given sample-based
attack. This allows us to identify the factors that lead to an increased
robustness of SNNs and gives theoretical explanations for: (i) the well known
observation, that increasing the amount of samples drawn for the estimation of
adversarial examples increases the attack's strength, (ii) why increasing the
number of samples during an attack can not fully reduce the effect of
stochasticity, (iii) why the sample size during inference does not influence
the robustness, and (iv) why a higher gradient variance and a shorter expected
value of the gradient relates to a higher robustness. Our theoretical findings
give a unified view on the mechanisms underlying previously proposed approaches
for increasing attack strengths or model robustness and are verified by an
extensive empirical analysis.

					<dc:description>  Many strongly correlated transition metal insulators are colored, even though
they have large fundamental band gaps and no quasi-particle excitations in the
visible range. Why such insulators possess the colors they do poses a serious
challenge for any many-body theory to reliably pick up the interactions
responsible for the color. We pick two archetypal cases as examples: NiO with
green color and MnF\textsubscript{2} with pink color. The body of literature
around the collective charge transitions (excitons) that are responsible for
the color in these and other strongly correlated systems, often fail to
disentangle two important factors: what makes them form and what makes them
optically bright. An adequate answer requires a theoretical approach able to
compute such excitations in periodic crystals, reliably and without free
parameters -- a formidable challenge. We employ two kinds of advanced \emph{ab
initio} many body Green's function theories to investigate both optical and
spin susceptibilities. The first, a perturbative theory based on low-order
extensions of the $GW$ approximation, is able to explain the color in NiO, and
indeed well describe the dielectric response over the entire frequency
spectrum, while the same theory is unable to explain why MnF\textsubscript{2}
is pink. We show its color originates from higher order spin-flip transitions
that modify the optical response. This phenomenon is not captured by low-order
perturbation theory, but it is contained in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT),
which has a dynamical spin-flip vertex that contributes to the charge
susceptibility. We show that symmetry lowering mechanisms, such as spin-orbit
coupling, odd-parity phonons and Jan-Teller distortions, determine how `bright'
these excitons are, but are not fundamental to their existence.

					<dc:description>  We formulate a non-relativistic quantum field theory to model interactions
between quantized electromagnetic fields and localized charge-current
distributions. The electronic degrees of freedom are encoded in microscopic
polarization and magnetization field operators whose moments are identified
with the multipole moments of the charge-current distribution. The multipolar
Hamiltonian is obtained from the minimal coupling Hamiltonian through a unitary
transformation, often referred to as the Power-Zienau-Woolley transformation;
we renormalize this Hamiltonian using perturbation theory, the result of which
is used to compute the leading-order radiative corrections to the electronic
energy levels due to interactions between the electrons and quantum vacuum
fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. Our renormalized energy shift
constitutes a generalization of the Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen, valid for
general localized assemblies of atoms and molecules, possibly with net charge
but absent free current. By expanding the fields in a series of multipole
moments, our results can be used to study contributions to this energy shift
coming from specific multipole moments of arbitrary order.

					<dc:description>  A long-standing debate is whether social influence improves the collective
wisdom of a crowd or undermines it. This paper addresses this question based on
a naive learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals
evolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average
opinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous
theoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing
and undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom
of finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the
truth as group size increases, provided individuals' variances are finite. We
show that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is
determined by the social power allocation of the influence system: if the
influence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more
accurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence
system assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines
the wisdom. At a population level, individuals' susceptibilities to
interpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve
the wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have
larger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if
relatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the
wisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the
wisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence.
Our investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role
social influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom.

					<dc:description>  The Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework makes it possible to integrate advanced
image denoising priors into optimization algorithms, to efficiently solve a
variety of image restoration tasks generally formulated as Maximum A Posteriori
(MAP) estimation problems. The Plug-and-Play alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and the Regularization by Denoising (RED) algorithms are two
examples of such methods that made a breakthrough in image restoration.
However, while the former method only applies to proximal algorithms, it has
recently been shown that there exists no regularization that explains the RED
algorithm when the denoisers lack Jacobian symmetry, which happen to be the
case of most practical denoisers. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no
method for training a network that directly represents the gradient of a
regularizer, which can be directly used in Plug-and-Play gradient-based
algorithms. We show that it is possible to train a network directly modeling
the gradient of a MAP regularizer while jointly training the corresponding MAP
denoiser. We use this network in gradient-based optimization methods and obtain
better results comparing to other generic Plug-and-Play approaches. We also
show that the regularizer can be used as a pre-trained network for unrolled
gradient descent. Lastly, we show that the resulting denoiser allows for a

					<dc:description>  Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the 2H structural
phase have been recently classified as higher-order topological insulators
(HOTI), protected by $C_3$ rotation symmetry. In addition, theoretical
calculations show an orbital Hall plateau in the insulating gap of TMDs,
characterized by an orbital Chern number. We explore the correlation between
these two phenomena in TMD monolayers in two structural phases: the
noncentrosymmetric 2H and the centrosymmetric 1T. Using density functional
theory, we confirm the characteristics of 2H-TMDs and reveal that 1T-TMDs are
identified by a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological invariant. As a result, when cut
along appropriate directions, they host conducting edge-states, which cross
their bulk energy-band gaps and can transport orbital angular momentum. Our
linear response calculations thus indicate that the HOTI phase is accompanied
by an orbital Hall effect. Using general symmetry arguments, we establish a
connection between the two phenomena with potential implications for
spin-orbitronics.

					<dc:description>  There has been a long debate on the thermodynamic stability of iron phases
under the Earth's inner core conditions, mainly due to the considerable
uncertainty in determining the melting temperatures of iron phases. In the
present study, we utilized a semi-empirical potential fitted to
high-temperature \textit{ab initio} data to perform a thermodynamic integration
from classical systems described by this potential to \textit{ab initio}
systems. This method provides a smooth path for the thermodynamic integration
and significantly reduces the uncertainty caused by the finite size effect
within 15 K. Our results suggest the hcp phase is the ground state of pure iron
under the inner core conditions, while the free energy difference between the
hcp and bcc phases is tiny, on the order of 10s meV/atom.

					<dc:description>  Despite the conceptual importance of contextuality in quantum mechanics,
there is a hitherto limited number of applications requiring contextuality but
not entanglement. Here, we show that for any quantum state and observables of
sufficiently small dimensions producing contextuality, there exists a
communication task with quantum advantage. Conversely, any quantum advantage in
this task admits a proof of contextuality whenever an additional condition
holds. We further show that given any set of observables allowing for quantum
state-independent contextuality, there exists a class of communication tasks
wherein the difference between classical and quantum communication complexities
increases as the number of inputs grows. Finally, we show how to convert each
of these communication tasks into a semi-device-independent protocol for
quantum key distribution.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper we propose a data-driven distributionally robust Model
Predictive Control framework for constrained stochastic systems with unbounded
additive disturbances. Recursive feasibility is ensured by optimizing over an
linearly interpolated initial state constraint in combination with a simplified
affine disturbance feedback policy. We consider a moment-based ambiguity set
with data-driven radius for the second moment of the disturbance, where we
derive a minimum number of samples in order to ensure user-given confidence
bounds on the chance constraints and closed-loop performance. The paper closes
with a numerical example, highlighting the performance gain and chance
constraint satisfaction based on different sample sizes.

					<dc:description>  In distributed or federated optimization and learning, communication between
the different computing units is often the bottleneck and gradient compression
is widely used to reduce the number of bits sent within each communication
round of iterative methods. There are two classes of compression operators and
separate algorithms making use of them. In the case of unbiased random
compressors with bounded variance (e.g., rand-k), the DIANA algorithm of
Mishchenko et al. (2019), which implements a variance reduction technique for
handling the variance introduced by compression, is the current state of the
art. In the case of biased and contractive compressors (e.g., top-k), the EF21
algorithm of Richt\'arik et al. (2021), which instead implements an
error-feedback mechanism, is the current state of the art. These two classes of
compression schemes and algorithms are distinct, with different analyses and
proof techniques. In this paper, we unify them into a single framework and
propose a new algorithm, recovering DIANA and EF21 as particular cases. Our
general approach works with a new, larger class of compressors, which has two
parameters, the bias and the variance, and includes unbiased and biased
compressors as particular cases. This allows us to inherit the best of the two
worlds: like EF21 and unlike DIANA, biased compressors, like top-k, whose good
performance in practice is recognized, can be used. And like DIANA and unlike
EF21, independent randomness at the compressors allows to mitigate the effects
of compression, with the convergence rate improving when the number of parallel
workers is large. This is the first time that an algorithm with all these
features is proposed. We prove its linear convergence under certain conditions.
Our approach takes a step towards better understanding of two so-far distinct
worlds of communication-efficient distributed learning.

					<dc:description>  There are considerable interests in automatic stroke lesion segmentation on
magnetic resonance (MR) images in the medical imaging field, as stroke is an
important cerebrovascular disease. Although deep learning-based models have
been proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen sites is
difficult due to not only the large inter-site discrepancy among different
scanners, imaging protocols, and populations, but also the variations in stroke
lesion shape, size, and location. To tackle this issue, we introduce a
self-adaptive normalization network, termed SAN-Net, to achieve adaptive
generalization on unseen sites for stroke lesion segmentation. Motivated by
traditional z-score normalization and dynamic network, we devise a masked
adaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize inter-site discrepancies,
which standardizes input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated
style by dynamically learning affine parameters from the input; \ie, MAIN can
affinely transform the intensity values. Then, we leverage a gradient reversal
layer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant representation with a
site classifier, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction
with MAIN. Finally, inspired by the ``pseudosymmetry'' of the human brain, we
introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation technique, termed
symmetry-inspired data augmentation (SIDA), that can be embedded within SAN-Net
to double the sample size while halving memory consumption. Experimental
results on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS)
v1.2 dataset, which includes MR images from 9 different sites, demonstrate that
under the ``leave-one-site-out'' setting, the proposed SAN-Net outperforms
recently published methods in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative
comparisons.

					<dc:title>A quantum phase-space equivalence leads to hidden causal loops in a

					<dc:description>  We show how unobservable causal loops arise from quantum mechanics, and can
explain quantum measurement consistently with macroscopic realism. We analyze a
measurement $\hat{x}$ on a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates
$|x_{j}\rangle$ where the measurement is modeled by amplification. We prove an
equivalence between the positive phase-space distribution $Q(x,p,t)$, and
simultaneous backward and forward-propagating stochastic trajectories for
amplitudes $x$ and $p$. The sampling for the amplified variable $x$ is
specified by a future boundary condition determined by the measurement setting,
the backward and forward trajectories being linked at the initial-time boundary
to form a loop. We confirm that the joint densities for $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ yield
$Q(x,p,t)$, thus demonstrating causal consistency and Born's rule. A feature is
hidden vacuum noise associated with an eigenstate. Unlike the eigenvalue
$x_{j}$, this noise is not amplified, the fluctuations originating from future
boundary conditions. For macroscopic superpositions of $|x_{j}\rangle$, we show
consistency with macroscopic realism: the outcome for $\hat{x}$ can be
considered a real property at the time $t_{0}$ prior to measurement
(independent of future events). We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving
causal relations for amplified variables, along with hidden causal loops for
unamplified quantities, demonstrating that causal loops do not imply
(observable) retrocausality. Further, we evaluate $Q_{j}(x,p,0)$ for the
trajectories conditioned on the outcome $x_{j}$. The ``state'' defined by this
function cannot be a quantum state, the uncertainties for $\hat{x}$ and
$\hat{p}$ being too small. However, $Q_{j}(x,p,0)$ approaches that of
$|x_{j}\rangle$ for a macroscopic superposition. Our results provide a
framework for study of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell correlations.

					<dc:description>  Although existing deep learning compressed-sensing-based Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (CS-MRI) methods have achieved considerably impressive performance,
explainability and generalizability continue to be challenging for such methods
since the transition from mathematical analysis to network design not always
natural enough, often most of them are not flexible enough to handle
multi-sampling-ratio reconstruction assignments. {In this work, to tackle
explainability and generalizability, we propose a unifying deep unfolding
multi-sampling-ratio interpretable CS-MRI framework.} The combined approach
offers more generalizability than previous works whereas deep learning gains
explainability through a geometric prior module. Inspired by the multigrid
algorithm, we first embed the CS-MRI-based optimization algorithm into
correction-distillation scheme that consists of three ingredients:
pre-relaxation module, correction module and geometric prior distillation
module. Furthermore, we employ a condition module to learn adaptively
step-length and noise level, which enables the proposed framework to jointly
train multi-ratio tasks through a single model. { The proposed model not only
compensates for the lost contextual information of reconstructed image which is
refined from low frequency error in geometric characteristic k-space}, but also
integrates the theoretical guarantee of model-based methods and the superior
reconstruction performances of deep learning-based methods. Therefore, it can
give us a novel perspective to design biomedical imaging networks. { Numerical
experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations.} {Our method achieves 3.18
dB improvement at low CS ratio 10\% and average 1.42 dB improvement over other
comparison methods on brain dataset using Cartesian sampling mask.

					<dc:description>  Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is a crucial task for emotion analysis from
facial movements. The apparent differences of different subjects sometimes
mislead changes brought by AUs, resulting in inaccurate results. However, most
of the existing AU detection methods based on deep learning didn't consider the
identity information of different subjects. The paper proposes a
meta-learning-based cross-subject AU detection model to eliminate the
identity-caused differences. Besides, a transformer-based relation learning
module is introduced to learn the latent relations of multiple AUs. To be
specific, our proposed work is composed of two sub-tasks. The first sub-task is
meta-learning-based AU local region representation learning, called MARL, which
learns discriminative representation of local AU regions that incorporates the
shared information of multiple subjects and eliminates identity-caused
differences. The second sub-task uses the local region representation of AU of
the first sub-task as input, then adds relationship learning based on the
transformer encoder architecture to capture AU relationships. The entire
training process is cascaded. Ablation study and visualization show that our
MARL can eliminate identity-caused differences, thus obtaining a robust and
generalized AU discriminative embedding representation. Our results prove that
on the two public datasets BP4D and DISFA, our method is superior to the
state-of-the-art technology, and the F1 score is improved by 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.

					<dc:description>  We introduce a method for improving the structural understanding abilities of
language models. Unlike previous approaches that finetune the models with
task-specific augmentation, we pretrain language models on a collection of
task-agnostic corpora to generate structures from text. Our structure
pretraining enables zero-shot transfer of the learned knowledge that models
have about the structure tasks. We study the performance of this approach on 28
datasets, spanning 10 structure prediction tasks including open information
extraction, joint entity and relation extraction, named entity recognition,
relation classification, semantic role labeling, event extraction, coreference
resolution, factual probe, intent detection, and dialogue state tracking. We
further enhance the pretraining with the task-specific training sets. We show
that a 10B parameter language model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and
obtains state-of-the-art performance on 21 of 28 datasets that we evaluate.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where many clients
collaboratively learn a shared global model with decentralized training data.
Personalization on FL model additionally adapts the global model to different
clients, achieving promising results on consistent local training &amp; test
distributions. However, for real-world personalized FL applications, it is
crucial to go one step further: robustifying FL models under evolving local
test set during deployment, where various types of distribution shifts can
arise. In this work, we identify the pitfalls of existing works under test-time
distribution shifts and propose a novel test-time robust personalization
method, namely Federated Test-time Head Ensemble plus tuning (FedTHE+). We
illustrate the advancement of FedTHE+ (and its degraded computationally
efficient variant FedTHE) over strong competitors, for training various neural
architectures (CNN, ResNet, and Transformer) on CIFAR10 and ImageNet and
evaluating on diverse test distributions. Along with this, we build a benchmark
for assessing performance and robustness of personalized FL methods during
deployment.

					<dc:description>  Curvilinear structure segmentation is important in medical imaging,
quantifying structures such as vessels, airways, neurons, or organ boundaries
in 2D slices. Segmentation via pixel-wise classification often fails to capture
the small and low-contrast curvilinear structures. Prior topological
information is typically used to address this problem, often at an expensive
computational cost, and sometimes requiring prior knowledge of the expected
topology.
  We present DTU-Net, a data-driven approach to topology-preserving curvilinear
structure segmentation. DTU-Net consists of two sequential, lightweight U-Nets,
dedicated to texture and topology, respectively. While the texture net makes a
coarse prediction using image texture information, the topology net learns
topological information from the coarse prediction by employing a triplet loss
trained to recognize false and missed splits in the structure. We conduct
experiments on a challenging multi-class ultrasound scan segmentation dataset
as well as a well-known retinal imaging dataset. Results show that our model
outperforms existing approaches in both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and
topological continuity, with no need for prior topological knowledge.

					<dc:description>  The 2017 detection of a kilonova coincident with gravitational-wave emission
has identified neutron star mergers as the major source of the heaviest
elements, and dramatically constrained alternative theories of gravity.
Observing a population of such sources has the potential to transform
cosmology, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. However, with only one confident
multi-messenger detection currently available, modelling the diversity of
signals expected from such a population requires improved theoretical
understanding. In particular, models which are quick to evaluate, and are
calibrated with more detailed multi-physics simulations, are needed to design
observational strategies for kilonovae detection, and to obtain rapid-response
interpretations of new observations. We use grey-opacity models to construct
populations of kilonovae, spanning ejecta parameters predicted by numerical
simulations. Our modelling focuses on wavelengths relevant for upcoming optical
surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
In these simulations, we implement heating rates that are based on nuclear
reaction network calculations. We create a Gaussian-process emulator for
kilonova grey opacities, calibrated with detailed radiative transfer
simulations. Using recent fits to numerical relativity simulations, we predict
how the ejecta parameters from BNS mergers shape the population of kilonovae,
accounting for the viewing-angle dependence. Our simulated population of binary
neutron star (BNS) mergers produce peak i-band absolute magnitudes $-20 \leq
M_i \leq -11$. A comparison with detailed radiative transfer calculations
indicates that further improvements are needed to accurately reproduce spectral
shapes over the full light curve evolution.

					<dc:description>  Position Embeddings (PEs), an arguably indispensable component in Vision
Transformers (ViTs), have been shown to improve the performance of ViTs on many
vision tasks. However, PEs have a potentially high risk of privacy leakage
since the spatial information of the input patches is exposed. This caveat
naturally raises a series of interesting questions about the impact of PEs on
the accuracy, privacy, prediction consistency, etc. To tackle these issues, we
propose a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method. In particular,
MJP first shuffles the selected patches via our block-wise random jigsaw puzzle
shuffle algorithm, and their corresponding PEs are occluded. Meanwhile, for the
non-occluded patches, the PEs remain the original ones but their spatial
relation is strengthened via our dense absolute localization regressor. The
experimental results reveal that 1) PEs explicitly encode the 2D spatial
relationship and lead to severe privacy leakage problems under gradient
inversion attack; 2) Training ViTs with the naively shuffled patches can
alleviate the problem, but it harms the accuracy; 3) Under a certain shuffle
ratio, the proposed MJP not only boosts the performance and robustness on
large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-C, -A/O) but also improves
the privacy preservation ability under typical gradient attacks by a large
margin. The source code and trained models are available
at~\url{https://github.com/yhlleo/MJP}.

					<dc:title>Cost-Optimal Laser-Accelerated Lightsails</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Parkin, Kevin L. G.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Space Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Laser-accelerated lightsails enable new types of missions that are very
different from the Breakthrough Starshot mission to the Centauri system that
aims to send 1 gram of payload at 0.2 c. The present work widens the mission
design space to 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload and 0.0001-0.99 c cruise velocity.
Drawing up to 5 GW directly from the grid (to augment power drawn from local
energy storage) turns out to be the key to making small missions affordable: It
collapses the accelerating laser's capital cost by up to 5 orders of magnitude,
enabling new possibilities such as a 10 kg Solar system cubesat that
accelerates to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) using a 77 m sail and \$610M laser, costing
\$58M worth of energy per mission.
  Trajectory equations describing lightsail acceleration are derived in closed
form and used instead of numerical integration. Consequently, analyses have
progressed from single point designs to whole performance maps comprised of
thousands of cost-optimized point designs. The performance maps reveal
qualitatively different regimes characterized by the particular constraint that
drives cost, and these driving constraints change depending on mission payload
mass and cruise velocity.
  The performance maps also reveal a family of cost-optimal missions that
accelerate at Earth gravity: The heaviest such mission is a 7.4 km diameter 100
kt vessel (equivalent to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated
for 21 days to achieve 0.07 c, reaching the Centauri system within a human
lifetime. While unthinkable at this time, the required 380 PW peak radiated
power (twice terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or
fusion within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate
such missions using laser-accelerated lightsails.

					<dc:description>  Recent studies revealed that deep learning is susceptible to backdoor
poisoning attacks. An adversary can embed a hidden backdoor into a model to
manipulate its predictions by only modifying a few training data, without
controlling the training process. Currently, a tangible signature has been
widely observed across a diverse set of backdoor poisoning attacks -- models
trained on a poisoned dataset tend to learn separable latent representations
for poison and clean samples. This latent separation is so pervasive that a
family of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed
latent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via
cluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently
follows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks?
This question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent
separability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor
poisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks
to present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two
key components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their
semantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor
learning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack
success rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison
samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness
of our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor
defenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with
negligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take
caution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.

					<dc:description>  We study the Bayesian regret of the renowned Thompson Sampling algorithm in
contextual bandits with binary losses and adversarially-selected contexts. We
adapt the information-theoretic perspective of \cite{RvR16} to the contextual
setting by considering a lifted version of the information ratio defined in
terms of the unknown model parameter instead of the optimal action or optimal
policy as done in previous works on the same setting. This allows us to bound
the regret in terms of the entropy of the prior distribution through a
remarkably simple proof, and with no structural assumptions on the likelihood
or the prior. The extension to priors with infinite entropy only requires a
Lipschitz assumption on the log-likelihood. An interesting special case is that
of logistic bandits with $d$-dimensional parameters, $K$ actions, and Lipschitz
logits, for which we provide a $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{dKT})$ regret upper-bound
that does not depend on the smallest slope of the sigmoid link function.

					<dc:description>  Continuous-variable optical quantum information processing (CVOQIP), where
quantum information is encoded in a traveling wave of light called a flying
qubit, is a candidate for a practical quantum computer with high clock
frequencies. Homodyne detectors for quadrature-phase amplitude measurements
have been the major factor limiting the clock frequency. Here, we developed a
real-time amplitude measurement method using a modular optical parametric
amplifier (OPA) and a broadband balanced photodiode that is commercially used
for coherent wavelength-division multiplexing telecommunication of the
fifth-generation mobile communication systems (5G). The OPA amplifies one
quadrature-phase component of the quantum-level signal to a loss-tolerant
macroscopic level, and acts as a &quot;magic wand,&quot; which suppresses the loss after
the OPA from 92.4\% to only 0.4\%. When the method was applied to a broadband
squeezed vacuum with a center wavelength of 1545.32 nm, we observed 5.2 $\pm$
0.5 dB of squeezing from DC to 43 GHz without any loss correction. The marriage
of CVOQIP and 5G technology arranged by the modular OPA will lead to a paradigm
shift from the conventional method of using stationary qubits, where the
information is encoded in a standing wave system, to a method using flying
qubits for ultra-fast practical quantum computation. This means that quantum
computer research will move from the stage of developing machines that execute
only specific quantum algorithms to a stage of developing machines that can
outperform classical computers in running any algorithm.

					<dc:description>  This paper develops a framework to conduct a counterfactual analysis to
regulate matching markets with regional constraints that impose lower and upper
bounds on the number of matches in each region. Our work is motivated by the
Japan Residency Matching Program, in which the policymaker wants to guarantee
the least number of doctors working in rural regions to achieve the minimum
standard of service. Among the multiple possible policies that satisfy such
constraints, a policymaker wants to choose the best. To this end, we develop a
discrete choice model approach that estimates the utility functions of agents
from observed data and predicts agents' behavior under different counterfactual
policies. Our framework also allows the policymaker to design the
welfare-maximizing tax scheme, which outperforms the policy currently used in
practice. Furthermore, a numerical experiment illustrates how our method works.

					<dc:description>  Bulk FeSe becomes superconducting below 9\,K, but the critical temperature
(T$_{c}$) is enhanced almost universally by a factor of $\sim$4-5 when it is
intercalated with alkali elements. How intercalation modifies the structure is
known from in-situ X-ray and neutron scattering techniques, but why T$_{c}$
changes so dramatically is not known. Here we show that there is one-to-one
correspondence between the enhancement in magnetic instabilities at certain
$\bf q$ vectors and superconducting pairing vertex, even while the nuclear spin
relaxation rate ${1}/{(T_{1}T)}$ may not reflect this enhancement.
Intercalation modifies electronic screening both in the plane and also between
layers. We disentangle quantitatively how superconducting pairing vertex gains
from each such changes in electronic screening. Intercalated FeSe provides an
archetypal example of superconductivity where information derived from the
single-particle electronic structure appears to be insufficient to account for
the origins of superconductivity, even when they are computed including
correlation effects. We show that the five-fold enhancement in T$_{c}$ on
intercalation is not sensitive to the exact position of the d$_{xy}$ at
$\Gamma$ point, as long as it stays close to E$_{F}$. Finally we show that
intercalation also significantly softens the collective charge excitations,
suggesting the electron-phonon interaction could play some role in intercalated
FeSe.

					<dc:description>  Supersymmetry is still a viable explanation for the muon $g-2$ anomaly, if
the sleptons and electroweak gauginos are $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV. However, for
supersymmetry breaking masses this light, the SUSY flavor and CP-problem are
exacerbated. To address this issue, we consider a flavor-safe gauge mediated
explanation of the muon $g-2$ with additional Higgs soft supersymmetry breaking
mass parameters. The setup provides a generic parameter space within minimal
gauge mediation. Furthermore, we show that the problematic CP violating phase
can be dynamically suppressed. We find that gauge mediation models have large
portions of parameter space where the muon $g-2$ can be explained at 1 $\sigma$
level. The interplay between the slepton and the CP-odd Higgs masses also makes
the majority of this model's parameter space testable at the LHC through
searches for sleptons or additional Higgs bosons.

					<dc:description>  Recently, it has been shown that neural networks not only approximate the
ground-state wave functions of a single molecular system well but can also
generalize to multiple geometries. While such generalization significantly
speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo
integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we
address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from
ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a
surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the
surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the
energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we
can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for
larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions.
Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing
physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such
a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In
our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of
magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared
to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to
74%.

					<dc:description>  A contextual bandit is a popular framework for online learning to act under
uncertainty. In practice, the number of actions is huge and their expected
rewards are correlated. In this work, we introduce a general framework for
capturing such correlations through a mixed-effect model where actions are
related through multiple shared effect parameters. To explore efficiently using
this structure, we propose Mixed-Effect Thompson Sampling (meTS) and bound its
Bayes regret. The regret bound has two terms, one for learning the action
parameters and the other for learning the shared effect parameters. The terms
reflect the structure of our model and the quality of priors. Our theoretical
findings are validated empirically using both synthetic and real-world
problems. We also propose numerous extensions of practical interest. While they
do not come with guarantees, they perform well empirically and show the
generality of the proposed framework.

					<dc:description>  We present TubeFormer-DeepLab, the first attempt to tackle multiple core
video segmentation tasks in a unified manner. Different video segmentation
tasks (e.g., video semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation) are usually
considered as distinct problems. State-of-the-art models adopted in the
separate communities have diverged, and radically different approaches dominate
in each task. By contrast, we make a crucial observation that video
segmentation tasks could be generally formulated as the problem of assigning
different predicted labels to video tubes (where a tube is obtained by linking
segmentation masks along the time axis) and the labels may encode different
values depending on the target task. The observation motivates us to develop
TubeFormer-DeepLab, a simple and effective video mask transformer model that is
widely applicable to multiple video segmentation tasks. TubeFormer-DeepLab
directly predicts video tubes with task-specific labels (either pure semantic
categories, or both semantic categories and instance identities), which not
only significantly simplifies video segmentation models, but also advances
state-of-the-art results on multiple video segmentation benchmarks

up to order 9 for several multiplicities. We introduce a class of
non-commutative fusion rings based on a group with transitive action on a set.
This generalizes the Tambara-Yamagami (TY) and Haagerup- Izumi (HI) fusion
rings. We give an example of such a ring which is categorifiable and is not of
TY or HI type. The structure of non-commutative fusion rings with a subgroup is
reviewed, and the one-and two-particle extensions of groups are classified. A
website containing data on fusion rings is introduced, and an overview of a
Wolfram Language package for working with these rings is given.

					<dc:title>Social Bias Meets Data Bias: The Impacts of Labeling and Measurement

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Although many fairness criteria have been proposed to ensure that machine
learning algorithms do not exhibit or amplify our existing social biases, these
algorithms are trained on datasets that can themselves be statistically biased.
In this paper, we investigate the robustness of a number of existing
(demographic) fairness criteria when the algorithm is trained on biased data.
We consider two forms of dataset bias: errors by prior decision makers in the
labeling process, and errors in measurement of the features of disadvantaged
individuals. We analytically show that some constraints (such as Demographic
Parity) can remain robust when facing certain statistical biases, while others
(such as Equalized Odds) are significantly violated if trained on biased data.
We also analyze the sensitivity of these criteria and the decision maker's
utility to biases. We provide numerical experiments based on three real-world
datasets (the FICO, Adult, and German credit score datasets) supporting our
analytical findings. Our findings present an additional guideline for choosing
among existing fairness criteria, or for proposing new criteria, when available
datasets may be biased.

					<dc:description>  Complex reasoning problems contain states that vary in the computational cost
required to determine a good action plan. Taking advantage of this property, we
propose Adaptive Subgoal Search (AdaSubS), a search method that adaptively
adjusts the planning horizon. To this end, AdaSubS generates diverse sets of
subgoals at different distances. A verification mechanism is employed to filter
out unreachable subgoals swiftly, allowing to focus on feasible further
subgoals. In this way, AdaSubS benefits from the efficiency of planning with
longer subgoals and the fine control with the shorter ones, and thus scales
well to difficult planning problems. We show that AdaSubS significantly
surpasses hierarchical planning algorithms on three complex reasoning tasks:
Sokoban, the Rubik's Cube, and inequality proving benchmark INT.

					<dc:title>A Preference Elicitation Approach for the Risk-Averse Ordered Weighted

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Decisions under uncertainty or with multiple objectives usually require the
decision maker to formulate a preference regarding risks or trade-offs. If this
preference is known, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) criterion can be
applied to aggregate scenarios or objectives into a single function.
Formulating this preference, however, can be challenging, as we need to make
explicit what is usually only implicit knowledge. We explore an
optimization-based method of preference elicitation for a risk-averse decision
maker to identify appropriate non-increasing OWA weights. We follow a
data-driven approach, assuming the existence of observations, where the
decision maker has chosen the preferred solution, but otherwise remains passive
during the elicitation process. We then use these observations to determine the
underlying preference by finding the preference vector that is at minimum
distance to the polyhedra of feasible vectors for each of the observations.
Using our optimization-based model, weights are determined by solving an
alternating sequence of linear programs and standard OWA problems. Numerical
experiments show that our passive elicitation method compares well against
actively having to conduct pairwise comparisons and performs particularly well
when there are inconsistencies in the decision maker's choices.

					<dc:description>  Background: Recent epidemic outbreaks such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the
mpox outbreak in 2022 demonstrated the value of genomic sequencing data to
assess the origin and spread of the pathogens. Laboratories around the globe
generated new sequences at unprecedented speed and volume while
bioinformaticians developed tools and dashboards to analyze the data. Hereby, a
major challenge that became apparent is the lack of efficient and simple
approaches to processing and accessing the sequencing data.
  Results: The Lightweight API for Sequences (LAPIS) facilitates rapid
retrieval and analysis of genomic sequencing data through a REST API. It
supports complex mutation and metadata queries and aggregations on massive
datasets and is optimized for typical questions relevant to genomic
epidemiology. Using a newly-developed in-memory database engine, it has a high
speed and throughput: between 25~January and 4~February 2023, the SARS-CoV-2
instance of LAPIS with 14.5 million sequences processed over 20 million
requests with a mean response time of 411~ms and a median response time of

					<dc:description>  We extend the concept of dual unitary quantum gates to quantum lattice models
in $2 + 1$ dimensions, by introducing and studying ternary unitary
four-particle gates, which are unitary in time and both spatial dimensions.
When used as building blocks of lattice models with periodic boundary
conditions in time and space (corresponding to infinite temperature states),
dynamical correlation functions exhibit a light-ray structure. We also
generalize solvable MPS to two spatial dimensions with cylindrical boundary
conditions, by showing that the analogous solvable PEPS can be identified with
matrix product unitaries. In the resulting tensor network for evaluating
equal-time correlation functions, the bulk ternary unitary gates cancel out. We
delineate and implement a numerical algorithm for computing such correlations
by contracting the remaining tensors.

					<dc:description>  We propose a novel and trainable graph unpooling layer for effective graph
generation. Given a graph with features, the unpooling layer enlarges this
graph and learns its desired new structure and features. Since this unpooling
layer is trainable, it can be applied to graph generation either in the decoder
of a variational autoencoder or in the generator of a generative adversarial
network (GAN). We prove that the unpooled graph remains connected and any
connected graph can be sequentially unpooled from a 3-nodes graph. We apply the
unpooling layer within the GAN generator. Since the most studied instance of
graph generation is molecular generation, we test our ideas in this context.
Using the QM9 and ZINC datasets, we demonstrate the improvement obtained by
using the unpooling layer instead of an adjacency-matrix-based approach.

					<dc:description>  Contrastive learning has shown great promise over annotation scarcity
problems in the context of medical image segmentation. Existing approaches
typically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled
medical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced
(i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and
usually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether
all negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an
Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative
contrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than
binary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more
semantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to
the positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a
more important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield
better performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global
semantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features
among the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During
the training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse
set of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation
boundaries and more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments across two
benchmark datasets and different unlabeled settings show that ACTION
significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning (FL) is a type of collaborative machine learning where
participating peers/clients process their data locally, sharing only updates to
the collaborative model. This enables to build privacy-aware distributed
machine learning models, among others. The goal is the optimization of a
statistical model's parameters by minimizing a cost function of a collection of
datasets which are stored locally by a set of clients. This process exposes the
clients to two issues: leakage of private information and lack of
personalization of the model. On the other hand, with the recent advancements
in various techniques to analyze data, there is a surge of concern for the
privacy violation of the participating clients. To mitigate this, differential
privacy and its variants serve as a standard for providing formal privacy
guarantees. Often the clients represent very heterogeneous communities and hold
data which are very diverse. Therefore, aligned with the recent focus of the FL
community to build a framework of personalized models for the users
representing their diversity, it is also of utmost importance to protect the
clients' sensitive and personal information against potential threats. To
address this goal we consider $d$-privacy, also known as metric privacy, which
is a variant of local differential privacy, using a a metric-based obfuscation
technique that preserves the topological distribution of the original data. To
cope with the issue of protecting the privacy of the clients and allowing for
personalized model training to enhance the fairness and utility of the system,
we propose a method to provide group privacy guarantees exploiting some key
properties of $d$-privacy which enables personalized models under the framework
of FL. We provide theoretical justifications to the applicability and
experimental validation on real datasets to illustrate the working of our
method.

					<dc:title>Can CNNs Be More Robust Than Transformers?</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  The recent success of Vision Transformers is shaking the long dominance of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image recognition for a decade.
Specifically, in terms of robustness on out-of-distribution samples, recent
research finds that Transformers are inherently more robust than CNNs,
regardless of different training setups. Moreover, it is believed that such
superiority of Transformers should largely be credited to their
self-attention-like architectures per se. In this paper, we question that
belief by closely examining the design of Transformers. Our findings lead to
three highly effective architecture designs for boosting robustness, yet simple
enough to be implemented in several lines of code, namely a) patchifying input
images, b) enlarging kernel size, and c) reducing activation layers and
normalization layers. Bringing these components together, we are able to build
pure CNN architectures without any attention-like operations that are as robust
as, or even more robust than, Transformers. We hope this work can help the
community better understand the design of robust neural architectures. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/RobustCNN.

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We consider the problem of designing control protocols for possibly nonlinear
networks with delays that not only allow the fulfilment of some desired
behaviour but also simultaneously guarantee the rejection of polynomial
disturbances and the non-amplification of other classes of disturbances across
the network. To address this problem, we propose the systematic use of
multiplex architectures to deliver integral control protocols ensuring the
desired disturbance rejection and non-amplification properties. We then present
a set of sufficient conditions to assess these properties and hence to design
the multiplex architecture for both leaderless and leader-follower networks
with time-varying references consisting of possibly heterogeneous nonlinearly
coupled agents affected by communication delays. The effectiveness of our
conditions, which are also turned into an optimisation problem allowing
protocol design, is illustrated via both in-silico and experimental validations
with a real hardware set-up.

					<dc:description>  We consider the problem of certifying the robustness of deep neural networks
against real-world distribution shifts. To do so, we bridge the gap between
hand-crafted specifications and realistic deployment settings by proposing a
novel neural-symbolic verification framework, in which we train a generative
model to learn perturbations from data and define specifications with respect
to the output of the learned model. A unique challenge arising from this
setting is that existing verifiers cannot tightly approximate sigmoid
activations, which are fundamental to many state-of-the-art generative models.
To address this challenge, we propose a general meta-algorithm for handling
sigmoid activations which leverages classical notions of counter-example-guided
abstraction refinement. The key idea is to &quot;lazily&quot; refine the abstraction of
sigmoid functions to exclude spurious counter-examples found in the previous
abstraction, thus guaranteeing progress in the verification process while
keeping the state-space small. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
show that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on a range
of challenging distribution shifts.

					<dc:description>  We present a fabrication method for reliably and reproducibly forming
electrical contacts to 2D materials, based on the tri-layer resist system. We
demonstrate the applicability of this method for epitaxial graphene on silicon
carbide (epigraphene) and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
molybdenum disulfide ($MoS_2$). For epigraphene, the specific contact
resistances are of the order of $\rho_c$ ~ $50$ $\Omega\mu m$, and follow the
Landauer quantum limit, $\rho_c \propto n^{-1/2}$, with $n$ being the carrier
density of graphene. For $MoS_2$ flakes, our edge contacts enable field effect
transistors (FET) with ON/OFF ratio of $&gt; 10^6$ at room temperature ( $&gt; 10^9$
at cryogenic temperatures). The fabrication route here demonstrated allows for
contact metallization using thermal evaporation and also by sputtering, giving
an additional flexibility when designing electrical interfaces, which is key in
practical devices and when exploring the electrical properties of emerging
materials.

					<dc:description>  An algebra is introduced which can be considered as a rank 2 extension of the
Askey-Wilson algebra. Relations in this algebra are motivated by relations
between coproducts of twisted primitive elements in the two-fold tensor product
of the quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb C))$. It is
shown that bivariate $q$-Racah polynomials appear as overlap coefficients of
eigenvectors of generators of the algebra. Furthermore, the corresponding
$q$-difference operators are calculated using the defining relations of the
algebra, showing that it encodes the bispectral properties of the bivariate
$q$-Racah polynomials.

					<dc:description>  For a long time, the most common paradigm in Multi-Object Tracking was
tracking-by-detection (TbD), where objects are first detected and then
associated over video frames. For association, most models resourced to motion
and appearance cues, e.g., re-identification networks. Recent approaches based
on attention propose to learn the cues in a data-driven manner, showing
impressive results. In this paper, we ask ourselves whether simple good old TbD
methods are also capable of achieving the performance of end-to-end models. To
this end, we propose two key ingredients that allow a standard
re-identification network to excel at appearance-based tracking. We extensively
analyse its failure cases, and show that a combination of our appearance
features with a simple motion model leads to strong tracking results. Our
tracker generalizes to four public datasets, namely MOT17, MOT20, BDD100k, and
DanceTrack, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code
and models

					<dc:description>  The study of defect centers in silicon has been recently reinvigorated by
their potential applications in optical quantum information processing. A
number of silicon defect centers emit single photons in the telecommunication
$O$-band, making them promising building blocks for quantum networks between
computing nodes. The two-carbon G-center, self-interstitial W-center, and
spin-$1/2$ T-center are the most intensively studied silicon defect centers,
yet despite this, there is no consensus on the precise configurations of defect
atoms in these centers, and their electronic structures remain ambiguous. Here
we employ \textit{ab initio} density functional theory to characterize these
defect centers, providing insight into the relaxed structures, bandstructures,
and photoluminescence spectra, which are compared to experimental results.
Motivation is provided for how these properties are intimately related to the
localization of electronic states in the defect centers. In particular, we
present the calculation of the zero-field splitting for the excited triplet
state of the G-center defect as the structure is transformed from the
A-configuration to the B-configuration, showing a sudden increase in the
magnitude of the $D_{zz}$ component of the zero-field splitting tensor. By
performing projections onto the local orbital states of the defect, we analyze
this transition in terms of the symmetry and bonding character of the G-center
defect which sheds light on its potential application as a spin-photon
interface.

					<dc:description>  Deploying robots in real-world domains, such as households and flexible
manufacturing lines, requires the robots to be taskable on demand. Linear
temporal logic (LTL) is a widely-used specification language with a
compositional grammar that naturally induces commonalities across tasks.
However, the majority of prior research on reinforcement learning with LTL
specifications treats every new formula independently. We propose LTL-Transfer,
a novel algorithm that enables subpolicy reuse across tasks by segmenting
policies for training tasks into portable transition-centric skills capable of
satisfying a wide array of unseen LTL specifications while respecting
safety-critical constraints. Experiments in a Minecraft-inspired domain show
that LTL-Transfer can satisfy over 90% of 500 unseen tasks after training on
only 50 task specifications and never violating a safety constraint. We also
deployed LTL-Transfer on a quadruped mobile manipulator in an analog household
environment to demonstrate its ability to transfer to many fetch and delivery
tasks in a zero-shot fashion.

					<dc:title>Approximating optimal SMC proposal distributions in individual-based

					<dc:creator>Rimella, Lorenzo</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Many epidemic models are naturally defined as individual-based models: where
we track the state of each individual within a susceptible population.
Inference for individual-based models is challenging due to the
high-dimensional state-space of such models, which increases exponentially with
population size. We consider sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for inference
for individual-based epidemic models where we make direct observations of the
state of a sample of individuals. Standard implementations, such as the
bootstrap filter or the auxiliary particle filter are inefficient due to
mismatch between the proposal distribution of the state and future
observations. We develop new efficient proposal distributions that take account
of future observations, leveraging the properties that (i) we can analytically
calculate the optimal proposal distribution for a single individual given
future observations and the future infection rate of that individual; and (ii)
the dynamics of individuals are independent if we condition on their infection
rates. Thus we construct estimates of the future infection rate for each
individual, and then use an independent proposal for the state of each
individual given this estimate. Empirical results show order of magnitude
improvement in efficiency of the sequential Monte Carlo sampler for both SIS
and SEIR models.

					<dc:description>  Embodied agents in vision navigation coupled with deep neural networks have
attracted increasing attention. However, deep neural networks have been shown
vulnerable to malicious adversarial noises, which may potentially cause
catastrophic failures in Embodied Vision Navigation. Among different
adversarial noises, universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), i.e., a constant
image-agnostic perturbation applied on every input frame of the agent, play a
critical role in Embodied Vision Navigation since they are
computation-efficient and application-practical during the attack. However,
existing UAP methods ignore the system dynamics of Embodied Vision Navigation
and might be sub-optimal. In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision
setting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise
$\delta$, as a $\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\delta$-MDP). Based
on the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\delta$-MDP and propose two
novel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for
attacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate
universal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q
function. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a
significant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with
different datasets and different scenes. Extensive experimental results
indicate that there exist serious potential risks for applying Embodied Vision
Navigation methods to the real world.

					<dc:description>  Positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used for the diagnosis of
serious diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, based on the uptake
of radiolabelled molecules that target certain pathological signatures.
Recently, a novel imaging mode known as positronium lifetime imaging (PLI) has
been shown possible with time-of-flight (TOF) PET as well. PLI is also of
practical interest because it can provide complementary disease information
reflecting conditions of the tissue microenvironment via mechanisms that are
independent of tracer uptake. However, for the present practical systems that
have a finite TOF resolution, the PLI reconstruction problem has yet to be
fully formulated for the development of accurate reconstruction algorithms.
This paper addresses this challenge by developing a statistical model for the
PLI data and deriving from it a maximum-likelihood algorithm for reconstructing
lifetime images alongside the uptake images. By using realistic computer
simulation data, we show that the proposed algorithm can produce quantitatively
accurate lifetime images for a 570~ps TOF PET system.

					<dc:description>  A novel analysis is performed, incorporating \emph{time-of-flight} (TOF)
information to study the interactions of dark matter (DM) with standard model
particles. After supernova (SN) explosions, DM with mass
$m_\chi\lesssim\mathcal{O}({\rm MeV})$ in the halo can be boosted by SN
neutrinos (SN$\nu$) to relativistic speed. The SN$\nu$ boosted DM (BDM) arrives
on Earth with TOF which depends only on $m_\chi$ and is independent of the
cross section. These BDMs can interact with detector targets in low-background
experiments and manifest as \emph{afterglow} events after the arrival of
SN$\nu$. The characteristic TOF spectra of the BDM events can lead to large
background suppression and unique determination of $m_\chi$. New cross section
constraints on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi e} \sigma_{\chi\nu}}$ are derived from
SN1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud with data from the Kamiokande and
Super-Kamiokande experiments. Potential sensitivities for the next galactic SN
with Hyper-Kamiokande are projected. This analysis extends the existing bounds
on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi e}\sigma_{\chi \nu}}$ over a broad range of
$r_\chi=\sigma_{\chi \nu}/\sigma_{\chi e}$. In particular, the improvement is
by 1--3 orders of magnitude for $m_\chi&lt;\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm keV})$ for
$\sigma_{\chi e}\sim\sigma_{\chi \nu}$. Prospects of exploiting TOF information
in other astrophysical systems to probe exotic physics with other DM candidates
are discussed.

					<dc:title>Sensitivity Analysis for Survey Weights</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Survey weighting allows researchers to account for bias in survey samples,
due to unit nonresponse or convenience sampling, using measured demographic
covariates. Unfortunately, in practice, it is impossible to know whether the
estimated survey weights are sufficient to alleviate concerns about bias due to
unobserved confounders or incorrect functional forms used in weighting. In the
following paper, we propose two sensitivity analyses for the exclusion of
important covariates: (1) a sensitivity analysis for partially observed
confounders (i.e., variables measured across the survey sample, but not the
target population), and (2) a sensitivity analysis for fully unobserved
confounders (i.e., variables not measured in either the survey or the target
population). We provide graphical and numerical summaries of the potential bias
that arises from such confounders, and introduce a benchmarking approach that
allows researchers to quantitatively reason about the sensitivity of their
results. We demonstrate our proposed sensitivity analyses using state-level
2020 U.S. Presidential Election polls.

					<dc:description>  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to achieve competitive results
to tackle graph-related tasks, such as node and graph classification, link
prediction and node and graph clustering in a variety of domains. Most GNNs use
a message passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising
results, MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing
and under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the
literature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most
state-of-the-art graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of
the graph, are neither differentiable nor inductive, and require the tuning of
hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose DiffWire, a novel framework for
graph rewiring in MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and
parameter-free by leveraging the Lov\'asz bound. The proposed approach provides
a unified theory for graph rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers
in MPNNs: CT-Layer, a layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a
relevance function for edge re-weighting; and GAP-Layer, a layer to optimize
the spectral gap, depending on the nature of the network and the task at hand.
We empirically validate the value of each of these layers separately with
benchmark datasets for graph classification. We also perform preliminary
studies on the use of CT-Layer for homophilic and heterophilic node
classification tasks. DiffWire brings together the learnability of commute
times to related definitions of curvature, opening the door to creating more
expressive MPNNs.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we discuss the construction of conserved tensors (currents)
involving conformal Killing-Yano tensors (CKYTs), generalising the
corresponding constructions for Killing-Yano tensors (KYTs). As a useful
preparation for this, but also of intrinsic interest, we derive identities
relating CKYTs and geometric quantities. The behaviour of CKYTs under conformal
transformations is also given, correcting formulae in the literature. We then
use the identities derived to construct covariantly conserved ``currents''. We
find several new CKYT currents and also include a known one by Penrose which
shows that ``trivial'' currents are also useful. We further find that rank-$n$
currents based on rank-$n$ CKYTs $k$ must have a simple form in terms of $dk$.
By construction, these currents are covariant under a general conformal
rescaling of the metric. How currents lead to conserved charges is then
illustrated using the Kerr-Newman and the C-metric in four dimensions.
Separately, we study a rank-1 current, construct its charge and discuss its
relation to the recently constructed Cotton current for the Kerr-Newman black
hole.

					<dc:description>  A broad class of models that routinely appear in several fields can be
expressed as partially or fully discretized Gaussian linear regressions.
Besides including basic Gaussian response settings, this class also encompasses
probit, multinomial probit and tobit regression, among others, thereby yielding
to one of the most widely-implemented families of models in applications. The
relevance of such representations has stimulated decades of research in the
Bayesian field, mostly motivated by the fact that, unlike for Gaussian linear
regression, the posterior distribution induced by such models does not seem to
belong to a known class, under the commonly-assumed Gaussian priors for the
coefficients. This has motivated several solutions for posterior inference
relying on sampling-based strategies or on deterministic approximations that,
however, still experience computational and accuracy issues, especially in high
dimensions. The scope of this article is to review, unify and extend recent
advances in Bayesian inference and computation for this class of models. To
address such a goal, we prove that the likelihoods induced by these
formulations share a common analytical structure that implies conjugacy with a
broad class of distributions, namely the unified skew-normals (SUN), that
generalize Gaussians to skewed contexts. This result unifies and extends recent
conjugacy properties for specific models within the class analyzed, and opens
avenues for improved posterior inference, under a broader class of formulations
and priors, via novel closed-form expressions, i.i.d. samplers from the exact
SUN posteriors, and more accurate and scalable approximations from VB and EP.
Such advantages are illustrated in simulations and are expected to facilitate
the routine-use of these core Bayesian models, while providing a novel
framework to study theoretical properties and develop future extensions.

					<dc:description>  Bottleneck identification is a challenging task in network analysis,
especially when the network is not fully specified. To address this task, we
develop a unified online learning framework based on combinatorial semi-bandits
that performs bottleneck identification in parallel with learning the
specifications of the underlying network. Within this framework, we adapt and
study various combinatorial semi-bandit methods such as epsilon-greedy, LinUCB,
BayesUCB, NeuralUCB, and Thompson Sampling. In addition, our framework is
capable of using contextual information in the form of contextual bandits.
Finally, we evaluate our framework on the real-world application of road
networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in different settings.

					<dc:description>  Real-world visual search systems involve deployments on multiple platforms
with different computing and storage resources. Deploying a unified model that
suits the minimal-constrain platforms leads to limited accuracy. It is expected
to deploy models with different capacities adapting to the resource
constraints, which requires features extracted by these models to be aligned in
the metric space. The method to achieve feature alignments is called
``compatible learning''. Existing research mainly focuses on the one-to-one
compatible paradigm, which is limited in learning compatibility among multiple
models. We propose a \textbf{S}witchable representation learning Framework with
Self-Compatibility (SFSC). SFSC generates a series of compatible sub-models
with different capacities through one training process. The optimization of
sub-models faces gradients conflict, and we mitigate this problem from the
perspective of the magnitude and direction. We adjust the priorities of
sub-models dynamically through uncertainty estimation to co-optimize sub-models
properly. Besides, the gradients with conflicting directions are projected to
avoid mutual interference. SFSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
evaluated datasets.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning has attracted increasing attention to building models
without accessing the raw user data, especially in healthcare. In real
applications, different federations can seldom work together due to possible
reasons such as data heterogeneity and distrust/inexistence of the central
server. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called MetaFed to
facilitate trustworthy FL between different federations. MetaFed obtains a
personalized model for each federation without a central server via the
proposed Cyclic Knowledge Distillation. Specifically, MetaFed treats each
federation as a meta distribution and aggregates knowledge of each federation
in a cyclic manner. The training is split into two parts: common knowledge
accumulation and personalization. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks
demonstrate that MetaFed without a server achieves better accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 10%+ accuracy improvement compared to the
baseline for PAMAP2) with fewer communication costs.

					<dc:description>  Even though Shapley value provides an effective explanation for a DNN model
prediction, the computation relies on the enumeration of all possible input
feature coalitions, which leads to the exponentially growing complexity. To
address this problem, we propose a novel method SHEAR to significantly
accelerate the Shapley explanation for DNN models, where only a few coalitions
of input features are involved in the computation. The selection of the feature
coalitions follows our proposed Shapley chain rule to minimize the absolute
error from the ground-truth Shapley values, such that the computation can be
both efficient and accurate. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we
comprehensively evaluate SHEAR across multiple metrics including the absolute
error from the ground-truth Shapley value, the faithfulness of the
explanations, and running speed. The experimental results indicate SHEAR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across different
evaluation metrics, which demonstrates its potentials in real-world
applications where the computational resource is limited.

					<dc:description>  Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to
multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When
phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a
family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites $n$. This
work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this
family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of
this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the
context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a
polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three,
attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the
polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any $n$, we provide
sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and hence, preclude
multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative
values and hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by
exploiting the structure of the polynomial, its Newton polytope, and employing
circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the set of
kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected
for all $n$.

is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colourings of $G$ and two colourings
are adjacent in $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ if they differ in colour on exactly one

$G$ is a $k$-colourable ($2K_2$, $C_4$)-free graph, then $\mathcal{R}_{k+1}(G)$
is connected with diameter at most $4n$. Furthermore, we show that

is critical to detect infection and inform optimal treatment. Surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning (ML) can distinguish among
multiple pathogen species, but processing complex fluid samples to sensitively
and specifically detect pathogens remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we
develop an acoustic bioprinter to digitize samples into millions of droplets,
each containing just a few cells, which are identified with SERS and ML. We
demonstrate rapid printing of 2 pL droplets from solutions containing S.
epidermidis, E. coli, and blood; when mixed with gold nanorods (GNRs), SERS
enhancements of up to 1500x are achieved.We then train a ML model and achieve

					<dc:description>  Group work is a prevalent activity in educational settings, where students
are often divided into topic-specific groups based on their preferences. The
grouping should reflect the students' aspirations as much as possible. Usually,
the resulting groups should also be balanced in terms of protected attributes
like gender or race since studies indicate that students might learn better in
a diverse group. Moreover, balancing the group cardinalities is also an
essential requirement for fair workload distribution across the groups. In this
paper, we introduce the multi-fair capacitated (MFC) grouping problem that
fairly partitions students into non-overlapping groups while ensuring balanced
group cardinalities (with a lower bound and an upper bound), and maximizing the
diversity of members in terms of protected attributes. We propose two
approaches: a heuristic method and a knapsack-based method to obtain the MFC
grouping. The experiments on a real dataset and a semi-synthetic dataset show
that our proposed methods can satisfy students' preferences well and deliver
balanced and diverse groups regarding cardinality and the protected attribute,
respectively.

					<dc:description>  We derive several upper bounds on the spectral gap of the Laplacian with
standard or Dirichlet vertex conditions on compact metric graphs. In
particular, we obtain estimates based on the length of a shortest cycle
(girth), diameter, total length of the graph, as well as further metric
quantities introduced here for the first time, such as the avoidance diameter.
Using known results about Ramanujan graphs, a class of expander graphs, we also
prove that some of these metric quantities, or combinations thereof, do not to
deliver any spectral bounds with the correct scaling.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we show how to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial
robustness to 2-norm bounded perturbations by relying exclusively on
off-the-shelf pretrained models. To do so, we instantiate the denoised
smoothing approach of Salman et al. 2020 by combining a pretrained denoising
diffusion probabilistic model and a standard high-accuracy classifier. This
allows us to certify 71% accuracy on ImageNet under adversarial perturbations
constrained to be within an 2-norm of 0.5, an improvement of 14 percentage
points over the prior certified SoTA using any approach, or an improvement of
30 percentage points over denoised smoothing. We obtain these results using
only pretrained diffusion models and image classifiers, without requiring any
fine tuning or retraining of model parameters.

					<dc:description>  We develop an interior-point approach to solve constrained variational
inequality (cVI) problems. Inspired by the efficacy of the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context,
we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as
ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide
convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when
the operator is $\xi$-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints
are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is, in
addition, L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates
for the gap function of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ for
the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the
general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Moreover, unlike
previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the
constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of
ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is
notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center,
and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint,
ACVI efficiently handles the constraints.

					<dc:description>  High-entropy concept introduced with a promising paradigm to obtain exotic
physical properties has motivated us to explore the thermoelectric properties
of Sr-substituted high-entropy rare-earth cobaltates i.e.,
(LaNdPrSmEu)$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CoO3 (0 \leq x \leq 0.10). The structural analysis of
the samples synthesized using the standard solid-state route, confirms the
orthorhombic structure with the Pbnm space group. The Seebeck coefficient and
electrical resistivity decrease with rising Sr concentration as well as with an
increase in temperature. The multiple A-site ions in high-entropy rare-earth
cobaltates result in an improved Seebeck coefficient ({\alpha}) compared to
La$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$CoO$_3$, associated with a decrease in the Co-O-Co bond
angle, which further enhances the power factor. The random distribution of
cations at the rare-earth site results in a significant lowering of phonon
thermal conductivity. As a result, a maximum figure of merit (zT) of 0.23 is
obtained at 350K for (LaNdPrSmEu)$_{0.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$CoO$_3$, which is one of
the highest values of zT reported at this temperature for oxide materials. This
study shows promise to decouple thermoelectric parameters using the
high-entropy concept in several materials.

					<dc:description>  Many protocols in quantum science and technology require initializing a
system in a pure quantum state. In the context of the motional state of massive
resonators, this enables studying fundamental physics at the elusive
quantum-classical transition, and measuring force and acceleration with
enhanced sensitivity. Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare
mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure
states. However, in order to overcome the heating and decoherence by the
thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we
laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the
quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement
the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one
phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity
already at room temperature. We furthermore introduce a powerful combination of
coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to
mitigate thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 30
phonons, limited by measurement imprecision. Doing away with the necessity for
cryogenic cooling should further facilitate the spread of optomechanical
quantum technologies.

					<dc:description>  Loop corrections to unequal-time correlation functions in Minkowski spacetime
exhibit secular growth due to a breakdown of time-dependent perturbation
theory. This is analogous to secular growth in equal-time correlators on
time-dependent backgrounds, except that in Minkowski the divergences must not
signal a real IR issue. In this paper, we calculate the late-time limit of the
two-point correlator for different massless self-interacting scalar quantum
field theories on a Minkowski background. We first use a late-time version of
the in-in path integral starting in the vacuum of the free theory; in this
limit, the calculation, including UV renormalization, reduces to that in
in-out. We find linear or logarithmic growth in time, depending on whether the
interaction strength is dimension-one or dimensionless, respectively. We next
develop the Weisskopf-Wigner resummation method, that proceeds by demanding
unitarity within a truncated Hilbert space, to calculate the resummed
correlator and find that it gives an exact exponentiation of the late-time
perturbative result. The resummed (unequal-time) correlator thus decays with an
exponential or polynomial time-dependence, which is suggestive of `universal'
behavior that depends on the dimensions of the interaction strength.

					<dc:description>  Loop corrections to finite-time correlation functions in quantum field
theories away from equilibrium can be calculated using the in-in path integral
approach. In this paper, we calculate the unequal-time two-point correlator for
different massless self-interacting scalar quantum field theories on a
Minkowski background, starting the field evolution at an arbitrary initial
time. We find the counterterms that need to be added to UV-renormalize the
result, including usual in-out counterterms in the dynamics and additional
initial state counterterms that are required to cancel all UV divergences. We
find that the late-time limit of the renormalized correlation function exhibits
a linear or logarithmic growth in time, depending on whether the interaction
strength is dimension-one or dimensionless, respectively. The late-time
correlations match those obtained in our companion paper and, as shown there,
the divergences do not indicate a real IR issue, consistent with what one would
expect in Minkowski.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the critical behavior, both in space and time, of the wetting
interface within the coexistence region around the first-order phase transition
of a fully-connected quantum Ising model in slab geometry. For that, we employ
the Lindblad master equation formalism in which temperature is inherited by the
coupling to a dissipative bath, rather than being a functional parameter as in
the conventional Cahn's free energy. Lindblad's approach gives not only access
to the dissipative dynamics and steady-state configuration of the quantum
wetting interface throughout the whole phase diagram but also shows that the
wetting critical behavior can be successfully exploited to characterize the
phase diagram as an alternative to the direct evaluation of the free energies
of the competing phases.

					<dc:description>  We present Ev-NeRF, a Neural Radiance Field derived from event data. While
event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the
measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain
discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based
vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event
cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view
consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating
the spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure
despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the
input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the
sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the
sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the
unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The
generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with
reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various
vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive
performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions
and high-dynamic-range imaging.

					<dc:subject>Physics - Classical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In the current research, we show that the second law of thermodynamics can be
broken by using a spontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND). The SND under
investigation is a narrow energy barrier. As the barrier width is much less
than the nominal particle mean free path, particle-particle collision is sparse
inside the barrier, so that the local particle trajectories tend to be
nonchaotic. The steady-state distribution of particle number density across the
barrier is intrinsically in a non-Boltzmann form. Consequently, in a step-ramp
model system, an ordered particle flow can be spontaneously generated from
unforced particle movement. The system entropy decreases without energetic
penalty, allowing for production of useful work in a cycle through heat
absorption from a single thermal reservoir. The model system may be arbitrarily
large; the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is steady and significant.
The discussion is based on classical mechanics. As the concept of SND is
applied to a Fermi gas, a high specific power is predicted.

					<dc:description>  Reduced cohomology motivates to look at harmonic functions which satisfy
certain gradient conditions. If $G$ is a direct product of two infinite groups
or a (FC-central)-by-cyclic group, then there are no harmonic functions with
gradient in $c_0$ on its Cayley graphs. From this, it follows that a metabelian
group $G$ has no harmonic functions with gradient in $\ell^p$. Furthermore,
under a radial isoperimetric condition, groups whose isoperimetric profile is
bounded by power of logarithms also have no harmonic functions with gradient in
$\ell^p$.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we study when the Kobayashi distance on a Kobayashi hyperbolic
domain has certain visibility properties, with a focus on unbounded domains.
&quot;Visibility&quot; in this context is reminiscent of visibility, seen in negatively
curved Riemannian manifolds, in the sense of Eberlein-O'Neill. However, we do
not assume that the domains studied are Cauchy-complete with respect to the
Kobayashi distance, as this is hard to establish for domains in $\mathbb{C}^d$,
$d \geq 2$. We study the various ways in which this property controls the
boundary behavior of holomorphic maps. Among these results is a
Carath\'eodory-type extension theorem for biholomorphisms between planar
domains, notably: between infinitely-connected domains. We also explore
connections between our visibility property and Gromov hyperbolicity of the
Kobayashi distance.

					<dc:description>  Heating and cooling systems in buildings account for 31% of global energy
use, much of which are regulated by Rule Based Controllers (RBCs) that neither
maximise energy efficiency nor minimise emissions by interacting optimally with
the grid. Control via Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to
significantly improve building energy efficiency, but existing solutions
require access to building-specific simulators or data that cannot be expected
for every building in the world. In response, we show it is possible to obtain
emission-reducing policies without such knowledge a priori--a paradigm we call
zero-shot building control. We combine ideas from system identification and
model-based RL to create PEARL (Probabilistic Emission-Abating Reinforcement
Learning) and show that a short period of active exploration is all that is
required to build a performant model. In experiments across three varied
building energy simulations, we show PEARL outperforms an existing RBC once,
and popular RL baselines in all cases, reducing building emissions by as much
as 31% whilst maintaining thermal comfort. Our source code is available online

					<dc:description>  We theoretically investigate the phase transition from a non-trivial
topological $p$-wave superconductor to a trivial $s$-wave like superconducting
phase through a gapless phase, driven by different magnetic textures as an
one-dimensional spin-chain impurity, e.g. Bloch-type, in-plane and out-of-plane
N\'eel-type spin-chains etc. In our proposal, the chain of magnetic impurities
is placed on a spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductor where we obtain numerically
as well as analytically an effective $s$-wave like pairing due to spin
rotation, resulting in gradual destruction of the Majorana zero modes present
in the topological superconducting phase. In particular, when the impurity
spins are antiferromagnetically aligned i.e. spiral wave vector $G_{s}=\pi$,
the system becomes an effective $s$-wave superconductor without Majorana zero
modes in the local density of states. The Shiba bands, on the other hand,
formed due to the overlapping of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states play a crucial role in
this topological to trivial superconductor phase transition, confirmed by the
sign change in the minigap within the Shiba bands. We also characterize this
topological phase transition via gap closing and winding number analysis.
Moreover, interference of the Shiba bands exhibiting oscillatory behavior
within the superconducting gap, $-\Delta_{p}$ to $\Delta_{p}$, as a function of
$G_{s}$, also reflects an important evidence for the formation of an effective
$s$-wave pairing. Such oscillation is absent in the $p$-wave regime.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The object of study is a soft random geometric graph with vertices given by a
Poisson point process on a line and edges between vertices present with
probability that has a polynomial decay in the distance between them. Various
aspects of such models related to connectivity structures have been studied
extensively. In this paper we study the random graph from the perspective of
extreme value theory and focus on the occurrence of single long edges. The
model we investigate has non-periodic boundary and is parameterized by a
positive constant $\alpha$, which is the power for the polynomial decay of the
probabilities determining the presence of an edge. As a main result we provide
a precise description of the magnitude of the longest edge in terms of
asymptotic behavior in distribution. Thereby we illustrate a crucial dependence
on the power $\alpha$ and we recover a phase transition which coincides with
exactly the same phases in [2].

					<dc:description>  Understanding similarities and differences between the cuprate and nickelate
superconductors is drawing intense current interest. Competing charge orders
have been observed recently in the $undoped$ infinite-layer nickelates in sharp
contrast to the $undoped$ cuprates which exhibit robust antiferromagnetic
insulating ground states. The microscopic mechanisms driving these differences
remain unclear. Here, using in-depth first-principles and many-body theory
based modeling, we show that the parent compound of the nickelate family,
LaNiO$_2$, hosts a charge density wave (CDW) ground state with the predicted
wavevectors in accord with the corresponding experimental findings. The CDW
ground state is shown to be connected to a multi-orbital Peierls distortion.
Our study points to the key role of electron-phonon coupling effects in the
infinite-layer nickelates.

					<dc:description>  Deep Learning (DL) based downscaling has become a popular tool in earth
sciences recently. Increasingly, different DL approaches are being adopted to
downscale coarser precipitation data and generate more accurate and reliable
estimates at local (~few km or even smaller) scales. Despite several studies
adopting dynamical or statistical downscaling of precipitation, the accuracy is
limited by the availability of ground truth. A key challenge to gauge the
accuracy of such methods is to compare the downscaled data to point-scale
observations which are often unavailable at such small scales. In this work, we
carry out the DL-based downscaling to estimate the local precipitation data
from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which was created by
approximating the value from station location to a grid point. To test the
efficacy of different DL approaches, we apply four different methods of
downscaling and evaluate their performance. The considered approaches are (i)
Deep Statistical Downscaling (DeepSD), augmented Convolutional Long Short Term
Memory (ConvLSTM), fully convolutional network (U-NET), and Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN). A custom VGG network, used in the
SR-GAN, is developed in this work using precipitation data. The results
indicate that SR-GAN is the best method for precipitation data downscaling. The
downscaled data is validated with precipitation values at IMD station. This DL
method offers a promising alternative to statistical downscaling.

					<dc:description>  Choosing optimal maskers for existing soundscapes to effect a desired
perceptual change via soundscape augmentation is non-trivial due to extensive
varieties of maskers and a dearth of benchmark datasets with which to compare
and develop soundscape augmentation models. To address this problem, we make
publicly available the ARAUS (Affective Responses to Augmented Urban
Soundscapes) dataset, which comprises a five-fold cross-validation set and
independent test set totaling 25,440 unique subjective perceptual responses to
augmented soundscapes presented as audio-visual stimuli. Each augmented
soundscape is made by digitally adding &quot;maskers&quot; (bird, water, wind, traffic,
construction, or silence) to urban soundscape recordings at fixed
soundscape-to-masker ratios. Responses were then collected by asking
participants to rate how pleasant, annoying, eventful, uneventful, vibrant,
monotonous, chaotic, calm, and appropriate each augmented soundscape was, in
accordance with ISO 12913-2:2018. Participants also provided relevant
demographic information and completed standard psychological questionnaires. We
perform exploratory and statistical analysis of the responses obtained to
verify internal consistency and agreement with known results in the literature.
Finally, we demonstrate the benchmarking capability of the dataset by training
and comparing four baseline models for urban soundscape pleasantness: a
low-parameter regression model, a high-parameter convolutional neural network,
and two attention-based networks in the literature.

					<dc:description>  The leading order production of an SM singlet-like scalar has primarily been
realized through the gluon fusion process by mixing with the $SU(2)_L$ scalar
doublet of the model. The dominant part of the physical state, i.e., the
singlet component, does not have any role in its direct production. Focusing on
such a state with a mass smaller than the SM-like Higgs scalar, we calculate
the dominant next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections to its production
cross-section. With these improved cross-sections, the present and future LHC
limits may become somewhat more stringent.

					<dc:description>  We introduce an analytical framework for near-field radiative heat transfer
in bulk plasmonic and polar media. Considering material dispersion, we derive a
closed-form expression for the radiative thermal conductance, which
disentangles the role of optical loss from other material dispersion
characteristics, such as the spectral width of the Reststrahlen band in polar
dielectrics, as well as from the temperature. We provide a universal condition
for maximizing heat transfer that defines the optimal interplay between a
material's optical loss and polariton resonance frequency, based on which we
introduce tight bounds to near-field heat transfer. With this formalism, one
can quantitatively evaluate all polaritonic materials in terms of their
performance as near-field thermal emitters.

					<dc:description>  Although crystallization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, crystal
formation and melting still remain fascinating processes with several open
questions yet to be addressed. In this work, we study the emergent
crystallization of a laser-driven dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate due to the
interplay between long-range magnetic and effectively infinite-range
light-induced interactions. The competition between these two interactions
results in a collective excitation spectrum with two roton minima that
introduce two different length scales at which crystalline order can emerge. In
addition to the formation of regular crystals with simple periodic patterns due
to the softening of one of the rotons, we find that both rotons can also soften
simultaneously, resulting in the formation of exotic, complex periodic or
aperiodic density patterns. We also demonstrate dynamic state-preparation
schemes for achieving all the found crystalline ground states for
experimentally relevant and feasible parameter regimes.

					<dc:description>  In two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological insulators described
by Dirac models, the ${\mathbb Z}_{2}$ topological invariant can be described
by the spin Chern number. We present a linear response theory for the spin
Berry curvature that integrates to the spin Chern number, and introduce its
spectral function that can be measured at finite temperature by momentum- and
spin-resolved circular dichroism, which may be achieved by pump-probe type of
experiments using spin- and time-resolved ARPES. As a result, the sign of the
Pfaffian of the ${\mathbb Z}_{2}$ invariant can be directly measured. The spin
Chern number expressed in real space yields a spin Chern marker, whose spatial
variation may be measured by circular dichroism and spin-resolved photoemission
with a spatial resolution. A spin Chern correlator and a nonlocal spin Chern
marker are further proposed to characterize the quantum criticality near
topological phase transitions, which are shown to take the form of overlaps
between spin-selected Wannier states.

					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In numerical relativity simulations with non-trivial matter configurations,
one must solve the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints of the ADM formulation
for the metric variables in the initial data. We introduce a new scheme based
on the standard Conformal Transverse-Traceless (CTT) decomposition, in which
instead of solving the Hamiltonian constraint as a 2nd order elliptic equation
for a choice of mean curvature $K$, we solve an algebraic equation for $K$ for
a choice of conformal factor. By doing so, we evade the existence and
uniqueness problem of solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint without using the
usual conformal rescaling of the source terms. This is particularly important
when the sources are fundamental fields, as reconstructing the fields'
configurations from the rescaled quantities is potentially problematic. Using
an iterative multigrid solver, we show that this method provides rapid
convergent solutions for several initial conditions that have not yet been
studied in numerical relativity; namely (i) periodic inhomogeneous spacetimes
with large random Gaussian scalar field perturbations and (ii) asymptotically
flat black hole spacetimes with rotating scalar clouds.

					<dc:description>  Magneto-optical conductivity is a very widely studied transport coefficient,
useful to understand and characterize the behaviour of materials under magnetic
fields. Using the Kubo formula, we compute the components of the conductivity
tensor $\sigma_{\mu \nu}$ transverse to a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf B$,
for a single node of a multi-Weyl semimetal (with monopole charge $J$ equal to
two or three). We also include the results for a Weyl semimetal (with $J=1$),
and identify peaks in the conductivity profile which were not reported in
earlier studies. In our analysis, we explore how the tilting of the
Weyl/multi-Weyl cone affects $\sigma_{\mu \nu}$, focussing on both type-I and
type-II phases. All these systems have a linear-in-momentum dispersion along
the tilting axis, which is chosen to align with $\mathbf B$. In the type-II
phases, open Fermi pockets appear as artifacts of the low-energy effective
continuum models, which ignore higher-order momentum terms of the actual
bandstructures. Hence, we supplement the linear power term with a cubic term,
which closes the Fermi pockets, thus eliminating any need for an ad hoc cutoff
for the momentum integrals. Our results reveal that the absorptive parts of
$\sigma_{\mu \nu}$ display multiple peaks as functions of the frequency, whose
locations are determined by an energy scale $\sim |\mathbf B|^{J/2} $.

with 9 RGB-D images per object from different views. Object segmentation masks,
object poses and object attributes are provided. In addition, synthetic images
generated using 330 3D object models are used to augment the dataset. We
investigated (i) few-shot object classification and (ii) joint object

					<dc:description>  Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the
emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective
transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional
models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention
mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them,
i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with
improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size
continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin
Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme
convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be
eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a
recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity,
which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on
this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN
architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on
par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern
ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as
well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on
ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation
on MS COCO.

place to fabricate such a system, comprising the creation of tapered pyramidal
substrates and an in-house laser machining setup. Cavities made from these
mirrors are characterised, by laser spectroscopy, to possess similar optical
properties to state-of-the-art fibre-tip cavities, but offer a compelling route
towards improved performance, even when used to support only a single mode. The
implementation of a 2 by 2 cavity array and the independent frequency tuning
between at least three neighbouring sites are demonstrated.

					<dc:description>  We consider the dynamics of a gas bubble immersed in an incompressible fluid
of fixed temperature, and focus on the relaxation of an expanding and
contracting spherically symmetric bubble due to thermal effects. We study two
models, both systems of PDEs with an evolving free boundary: the full
mathematical model as well as an approximate model, arising for example in the
study of sonoluminescence. For fixed physical parameters (surface tension of
the gas-liquid interface, liquid viscosity, thermal conductivity of the gas,
etc.), both models share a family of spherically symmetric equilibria, smoothly
parametrized by the mass of the gas bubble. Our main result concerns the
approximate model. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the manifold
of equilibria with respect to small spherically symmetric perturbations. The
rate of convergence is exponential in time. To prove this result we first prove
a weak form of nonlinear asymptotic stability -- with no explicit rate of
time-decay -- using the energy dissipation law, and then, via a center manifold
analysis, bootstrap the weak time-decay to exponential time-decay.
  We also study the uniqueness of the family of spherically symmetric
equilibria within each model. The family of spherically symmetric equilibria
captures all spherically symmetric equilibria of the approximate system.
However within the full model, this family is embedded in a larger family of
spherically symmetric solutions. For the approximate system, we prove that all
equilibrium bubbles are spherically symmetric, by an application of
Alexandrov's theorem on closed surfaces of constant mean curvature.

					<dc:description>Comment: Exponential stability result is added to a new Section 6.3. The proof
  is in a new Section 9. The idea of the proof is to use a center manifold
  analysis (in a new Appendix F) and spectral analysis of the linearized
  operator (in a new Appendix E) to promote the weak time-decay to exponential
  time-decay</dc:description>

					<dc:description>  The present research investigates the effectiveness of using a telepresence
system compared to a video conferencing system and the effectiveness of using
two cameras compared to one camera for remote physical therapy. We used Telegie
as our telepresence system, which allowed users to see an environment captured
with RGBD cameras in 3D through a VR headset. Since both telepresence and the
inclusion of a second camera provide users with additional spatial information,
we examined this affordance within the relevant context of remote physical
therapy. Our dyadic study across different time zones paired 11 physical
therapists with 76 participants who took on the role of patients for a remote
session. Our quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative interviews with
therapists revealed several important findings. First, after controlling for
individual differences between participants, using two cameras had a marginally
significant positive effect on physical therapy assessment scores from
therapists. Second, the spatial ability of patients was a strong predictor of
therapist assessment. And third, the video clarity of remote communication
systems mattered. Based on our findings, we offer several suggestions and
insights towards the future use of telepresence systems for remote
communication.

					<dc:description>  Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly used to make critical decisions
in real-world applications, yet they have become more complex, making them
harder to understand. To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques
to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these
explainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose
and how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address
these challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for
explaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,
TalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface
for engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly
accessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,
interprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates
text responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.
We carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of
TalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user
inputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the
system's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations
with humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they
would use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability
in a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel
was easier to use for computing explanations. Our findings demonstrate that
TalkToModel is more effective for model explainability than existing systems,
introducing a new category of explainability tools for practitioners. Code &amp;

					<dc:description>  Audio-visual target speech extraction, which aims to extract a certain
speaker's speech from the noisy mixture by looking at lip movements, has made
significant progress combining time-domain speech separation models and visual
feature extractors (CNN). One problem of fusing audio and video information is
that they have different time resolutions. Most current research upsamples the
visual features along the time dimension so that audio and video features are
able to align in time. However, we believe that lip movement should mostly
contain long-term, or phone-level information. Based on this assumption, we
propose a new way to fuse audio-visual features. We observe that for DPRNN
\cite{dprnn}, the interchunk dimension's time resolution could be very close to
the time resolution of video frames. Like \cite{sepformer}, the LSTM in DPRNN
is replaced by intra-chunk and inter-chunk self-attention, but in the proposed
algorithm, inter-chunk attention incorporates the visual features as an
additional feature stream. This prevents the upsampling of visual cues,
resulting in more efficient audio-visual fusion. The result shows we achieve
superior results compared with other time-domain based audio-visual fusion
models.

					<dc:description>  Persistent topological properties of an image serve as an additional
descriptor providing an insight that might not be discovered by traditional
neural networks. The existing research in this area focuses primarily on
efficiently integrating topological properties of the data in the learning
process in order to enhance the performance. However, there is no existing
study to demonstrate all possible scenarios where introducing topological
properties can boost or harm the performance. This paper performs a detailed
analysis of the effectiveness of topological properties for image
classification in various training scenarios, defined by: the number of
training samples, the complexity of the training data and the complexity of the
backbone network. We identify the scenarios that benefit the most from
topological features, e.g., training simple networks on small datasets.
Additionally, we discuss the problem of topological consistency of the datasets
which is one of the major bottlenecks for using topological features for
classification. We further demonstrate how the topological inconsistency can
harm the performance for certain scenarios.

					<dc:description>  For semantic-guided cross-view image translation, it is crucial to learn
where to sample pixels from the source view image and where to reallocate them
guided by the target view semantic map, especially when there is little overlap
or drastic view difference between the source and target images. Hence, one not
only needs to encode the long-range dependencies among pixels in both the
source view image and target view semantic map but also needs to translate
these learned dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel generative
adversarial network, PI-Trans, which mainly consists of a novel
Parallel-ConvMLP module and an Implicit Transformation module at multiple
semantic levels. Extensive experimental results show that PI-Trans achieves the
best qualitative and quantitative performance by a large margin compared to the
state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. The source code is
available at https://github.com/Amazingren/PI-Trans.

					<dc:description>  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are frequently
deployed to support a wide range of robotics applications, such as autonomous
navigation in unknown environments, and scene mapping in virtual reality. Many
of these applications require autonomous agents to perform SLAM in highly
dynamic scenes. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced,
unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving
objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of
recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present dynamic EKF SLAM: a
novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm generated from our framework, and
prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the
classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical
results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high
localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map
precision, with high efficiency.

					<dc:description>  Deep Learning-based Unsupervised Salient Object Detection (USOD) mainly
relies on the noisy saliency pseudo labels that have been generated from
traditional handcraft methods or pre-trained networks. To cope with the noisy
labels problem, a class of methods focus on only easy samples with reliable
labels but ignore valuable knowledge in hard samples. In this paper, we propose
a novel USOD method to mine rich and accurate saliency knowledge from both easy
and hard samples. First, we propose a Confidence-aware Saliency Distilling
(CSD) strategy that scores samples conditioned on samples' confidences, which
guides the model to distill saliency knowledge from easy samples to hard
samples progressively. Second, we propose a Boundary-aware Texture Matching
(BTM) strategy to refine the boundaries of noisy labels by matching the
textures around the predicted boundary. Extensive experiments on RGB, RGB-D,
RGB-T, and video SOD benchmarks prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art
USOD performance.

					<dc:description>  In this note, we show that Graph Isomorphism (GI) is not
$\textsf{AC}^{0}$-reducible to several problems, including the Latin Square
Isotopy problem, isomorphism testing of several families of Steiner designs,
and isomorphism testing of conference graphs. As a corollary, we obtain that GI
is not $\textsf{AC}^{0}$-reducible to isomorphism testing of Latin square
graphs and strongly regular graphs arising from special cases of Steiner
$2$-designs. We accomplish this by showing that the generator-enumeration
technique for each of these problems can be implemented in
$\beta_{2}\textsf{FOLL}$, which cannot compute Parity (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an,

					<dc:title>The character correspondence in the stable range over a p-adic field</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Given a real irreducible dual pair there is an integral kernel operator which
maps the distribution character of an irreducible admissible representation of
the group with the smaller or equal rank to an invariant eigendistribution on
the group with the larger or equal rank. If the pair is in the stable range and
if the representation is unitary, then the resulting distribution is the
character of the representation obtained via Howe's correspondence. This
construction was transferred to the p-adic case and a conjecture was
formulated.
  In this note we verify a weaker version of this conjecture for dual pairs in
the stable range over a p-adic field.

					<dc:description>  We prove that the simplest gravitational symmetry reduced models describing
cosmology and black holes mechanics are invariant under the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
group. We consider the flat FRW cosmology filled with a massless scalar field
and the Schwarzschild black hole mechanics, construct their conserved charges
using the Eisenhart-Duval (ED) lift method and show that they form a
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger algebra. Our method illustrates how the ED lift and the more
standard approach analyzing the geometry of the field space are complementarity
in revealing different set of symmetries of these systems. We further identify
an infinite-dimensional symmetry for those two models, generated by conserved
charges organized in two copies of a Witt algebra. These extended charge
algebras provide a new algebraic characterization of these homogeneous
gravitational sectors. They guide the path to their quantization and open the
road to non-linear extensions of quantum cosmology and quantum black holes
models in terms of hydrodynamic equations in field space.

					<dc:description>  If $H$ is a subgroup of a compact group $G$, the probability that a random
element of $H$ commutes with a random element of $G$ is denoted by $Pr(H,G)$.
Let $\langle g\rangle$ stand for the monothetic subgroup generated by an
element $g\in G$ and let $K$ be a subgroup of $G$. We prove that $Pr(\langle
x\rangle,G)&gt;0$ for any $x\in K$ if and only if $G$ has an open normal subgroup
$T$ such that $K/C_K(T)$ is torsion. In particular, $Pr(\langle x\rangle,G)&gt;0$
for any $x\in G$ if and only if $G$ is virtually central-by-torsion, that is,
there is an open normal subgroup $T$ such that $G/Z(T)$ is torsion. We also
deduce a number of corollaries of this result.

					<dc:description>  To construct an $A_{\infty}$-form for a loop space in the category of
diffeological spaces, we have two minor problems. Firstly, the concatenation of
paths in the category of diffeological spaces needs a small technical trick
(see P.~I-Zemmour \cite{MR3025051}), which apparently restricts the number of
iterations of concatenations. Secondly, we do not know a natural decomposition
of an associahedron as a smooth simplicial or cubical complex. By resolving
these difficulties, we show that the smooth loop space of a nice diffeological
space is a h-unital smooth $A_{\infty}$-space. In appendix, we show an
alternative solution by modifying the concatenation to be stable without
assuming reflexivity for spaces nor stability for paths.

					<dc:title>Separating the memory of reionization from cosmology in the Ly$\alpha$

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It has been recently shown that the astrophysics of reionization can be
extracted from the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum by marginalizing the memory
of reionization over cosmological information. This impact of cosmic
reionization on the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum can survive cosmological
time scales because cosmic reionization, which is inhomogeneous, and subsequent
shocks from denser regions can heat the gas in low-density regions to $\sim
3\times10^4$ K and compress it to mean-density. Current approach of
marginalization over the memory of reionization, however, is not only
model-dependent, based on the assumption of a specific reionization model, but
also computationally expensive. Here we propose a simple analytical template
for the impact of cosmic reionization, thereby treating it as a broadband
systematic to be marginalized over for Bayesian inference of cosmological
information from the Ly$\alpha$ forest in a model-independent manner. This
template performs remarkably well with an error of $\leq 6 \%$ at large scales
$k \approx 0.19$ Mpc$^{-1}$ where the effect of the memory of reionization is
important, and reproduces the broadband effect of the memory of reionization in
the Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation function, as well as the expected bias of
cosmological parameters due to this systematic. The template can successfully
recover the morphology of forecast errors in cosmological parameter space as
expected when assuming a specific reionization model for marginalization
purposes, with a slight overestimation of tens of per cent for the forecast
errors on the cosmological parameters. We further propose a similar template
for this systematic on the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D power spectrum.

					<dc:description>  This work studies the threats of adversarial attack on multivariate
probabilistic forecasting models and viable defense mechanisms. Our studies
discover a new attack pattern that negatively impact the forecasting of a
target time series via making strategic, sparse (imperceptible) modifications
to the past observations of a small number of other time series. To mitigate
the impact of such attack, we have developed two defense strategies. First, we
extend a previously developed randomized smoothing technique in classification
to multivariate forecasting scenarios. Second, we develop an adversarial
training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same
time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such
adversarial simulation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm
that our attack schemes are powerful and our defense algorithms are more
effective compared with baseline defense mechanisms.

					<dc:description>  We discuss the role of monotonicity in enabling numerically tractable modular

variational systems of monotone systems can be embedded into positive systems.
Utilizing this embedding, we show how to solve a network stabilization problem
by enforcing monotonicity and exponential dissipativity of the network
sub-components. Such modular approach leads to a design algorithm based on a
sequence of linear programming problems.

					<dc:description>  Designers use third-party intellectual property (IP) cores and outsource
various steps in the integrated circuit (IC) design and manufacturing flow. As
a result, security vulnerabilities have been rising. This is forcing IC
designers and end users to re-evaluate their trust in ICs. If attackers get
hold of an unprotected IC, they can reverse engineer the IC and pirate the IP.
Similarly, if attackers get hold of a design, they can insert malicious
circuits or take advantage of &quot;backdoors&quot; in a design. Unintended design bugs
can also result in security weaknesses.
  This tutorial paper provides an introduction to the domain of hardware
security through two pedagogical examples of hardware security problems. The
first is a walk-through of the scan chain-based side channel attack. The second
is a walk-through of logic locking of digital designs. The tutorial material is
accompanied by open access digital resources that are linked in this article.

					<dc:description>  We perform a model-independent global fit to all germane and updated $b \to s
\ell \ell$ ($\ell=e,\,\mu$) data assuming new physics couplings to be complex.
Under the approximation that new physics universally affects muon and electron
sectors and that either one or two related operators contribute at a time, we
identify scenarios which provide a good fit to the data. It turns out that the
favored scenarios remain the same as obtained for the real fit. Further, the
magnitude of complex couplings can be as large as that of their real
counterparts and these are reflected in the predictions of the direct $CP$
asymmetry, $A_{\rm CP}$, in $B \to (K,\, K^*) \mu^+ \mu^-$ along with a number
of angular $CP$ asymmetries, $A_i$, in $B^0 \to K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay. The
sensitivities of these observables to various solutions are different in the
low and high-$q^2$ bins. We also determine observables which can serve as
unique identifier for a particular new physics solution. Moreover, we examine
correlations between $A_{\rm CP}$ and several $A_i$ observables. A precise
measurement of $A_{\rm CP}$ and $A_i$ observables can not only confirm the
existence of additional weak phases but can also enable unique determination of
Lorentz structure of possible new physics in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transition.

					<dc:description>  This study contributes to the recent discussions on indicating
interdisciplinarity, i.e., going beyond catch-all metrics of
interdisciplinarity. We propose a multi-dimensional and contextual framework to
improve the granularity and usability of the existing methodology for
quantifying the interdisciplinary knowledge flow (IKF) in which scientific
disciplines import and export knowledge from/to other disciplines. To
characterize the knowledge exchange between disciplines, we recognize three
dimensions under this framework, namely, broadness, intensity, and
heterogeneity. We show that each dimension covers a different aspect of IKF,
especially between disciplines with the largest volume of IKF, and can assist
in uncovering different types of interdisciplinarity. We apply this framework
in two use cases, one at the level of disciplines and one at the level of
journals, to show how it can offer a more holistic and detailed viewpoint on
the interdisciplinarity of scientific entities than unidimensional and
context-unaware indicators. We further compare our proposed framework, an
indicating process, with established indicators and discuss how such
information tools on interdisciplinarity can assist science policy practices
such as performance-based research funding systems and panel-based peer review
processes.

class of the exponential family of bandits is considered. The state-of-the-art
algorithms for the exponential family of bandits face computational challenges.
To mitigate these challenges, a novel framework is proposed, which views the
BAI problem as sequential hypothesis testing, and is amenable to tractable
analysis for the exponential family of bandits. Based on this framework, a BAI
algorithm is designed that leverages the canonical sequential probability ratio
tests. This algorithm has three features for both settings: (1) its sample
complexity is asymptotically optimal, (2) it is guaranteed to be $\delta-$PAC,
and (3) it addresses the computational challenge of the state-of-the-art
approaches. Specifically, these approaches, which are focused only on the
Gaussian setting, require Thompson sampling from the arm that is deemed the
best and a challenger arm. This paper analytically shows that identifying the
challenger is computationally expensive and that the proposed algorithm
circumvents it. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to support the
analysis.

					<dc:description>  A locally uniform random permutation is generated by sampling $n$ points
independently from some absolutely continuous distribution $\rho$ on the plane
and interpreting them as a permutation by the rule that $i$ maps to $j$ if the
$i$th point from the left is the $j$th point from below. As $n$ tends to
infinity, decreasing subsequences in the permutation will appear as curves in
the plane, and by interpreting these as level curves, a union of decreasing
subsequences give rise to a surface. We show that, under the correct scaling,
for any $r\ge0$, the largest union of $\lfloor r\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ decreasing
subsequences approaches a limit surface as $n$ tends to infinity, and the limit
surface is a solution to a specific variational problem. As a corollary, we
prove the existence of a limit shape for the Young diagram associated to the
random permutation under the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. In the special
case where $\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the diamond $|x|+|y|&lt;1$ we
conjecture that the limit shape is triangular, and assuming the conjecture is
true we find an explicit formula for the limit surfaces of a uniformly random
permutation and recover the famous limit shape of Vershik, Kerov and Logan,
Shepp.

					<dc:description>  Algorithms that adjust the reactive power injection of converter-connected
RES to minimize losses may compromise the converters' fault-ride-through
capability. This can become crucial for the reliable operation of the
distribution grids, as they could lose valuable resources to support grid
voltage at the time they need them the most. This paper explores how two novel
loss-minimizing algorithms can both achieve high reduction of the system losses
during normal operation and remain connected to support the voltage during
faults. The algorithms we propose are decentralized and model-free: they
require no communication and no knowledge of the grid topology or the grid
location of the converters. Using local information, they control the reactive
power injection to minimize the system losses. In this paper, we extend these
algorithms to ensure the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of the
converters, and we integrate them with state-of-the-art Wavelet-CNN-LSTM RES
forecasting methods that enhance their performance. We perform extensive
simulations on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform, where we
demonstrate that the algorithms we propose can achieve a substantial decrease
in power losses while remaining compliant with the grid codes for LVRT makes
them suitable for the implementation across the distribution system.

					<dc:description>  We analyze self-dual polyhedral cones and prove several properties about
their slack matrices. In particular, we show that self-duality is equivalent to
the existence of a positive semidefinite (PSD) slack. Beyond that, we show that
if the underlying cone is irreducible, then the corresponding PSD slacks are
not only doubly nonnegative matrices (DNN) but are extreme rays of the cone of
DNN matrices, which correspond to a family of extreme rays not previously
described. More surprisingly, we show that, unless the cone is simplicial, PSD
slacks not only fail to be completely positive matrices but they also lie
outside the cone of completely positive semidefinite matrices. Finally, we show
how one can use semidefinite programming to probe the existence of self-dual
cones with given combinatorics. Our results are given for polyhedral cones but
we also discuss some consequences for negatively self-polar polytopes.

					<dc:title>Tilting Uranus via Secular Spin-Orbit Resonance with Planet 9</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Lu, Tiger</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Laughlin, Gregory</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Uranus' startlingly large obliquity of 98 degrees has yet to admit a
satisfactory explanation. The most widely accepted hypothesis involving a giant
impactor that tipped Uranus onto its side encounters several difficulties with
regards to the Uranus' spin rate and its prograde satellite system. An
obliquity increase that was driven by capture of Uranus into a secular
spin-orbit resonance remains a possible alternative hypothesis that avoids many
of the issues associated with a giant impact. We propose that secular
spin-orbit resonance could have excited Uranus' obliquity to its present day
value if it was driven by the outward migration of an as-yet undetected outer
Solar System body commonly known as Planet Nine. We draw support for our
hypothesis from an analysis of 123 N-body simulations with varying parameters
for Planet Nine and its migration. We find that in multiple instances, a
simulated Planet Nine drives Uranus' obliquity past 98 degrees, with a
significant number falling within 10 percent of this value. We note a
significant caveat to our results in that a much faster than present-day
spin-axis precession rate for Uranus is required in all cases for it to reach
high obliquities. We conclude that while it was in principle possible for
Planet Nine (if it exists) to have been responsible for Uranus' obliquity, the
feasibility of such a result hinges on Uranus' primordial precession rate.

					<dc:description>  We consider representation learning for proteins with 3D structures. We build
3D graphs based on protein structures and develop graph networks to learn their
representations. Depending on the levels of details that we wish to capture,
protein representations can be computed at different levels, \emph{e.g.}, the
amino acid, backbone, or all-atom levels. Importantly, there exist hierarchical
relations among different levels. In this work, we propose to develop a novel
hierarchical graph network, known as ProNet, to capture the relations. Our
ProNet is very flexible and can be used to compute protein representations at
different levels of granularity. By treating each amino acid as a node in graph
modeling as well as harnessing the inherent hierarchies, our ProNet is more
effective and efficient than existing methods. We also show that, given a base
3D graph network that is complete, our ProNet representations are also complete
at all levels. Experimental results show that ProNet outperforms recent methods
on most datasets. In addition, results indicate that different downstream tasks
may require representations at different levels. Our code is publicly available
as part of the DIG library (\url{https://github.com/divelab/DIG}).

					<dc:description>  The strange metal (SM) state, characterized by a linear-in-temperature
resistivity, is often seen in the normal state of high temperature
superconductors. It is believed that the SM state is one of the keys to
understand the underlying mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity. Here we
report the first observation of the concurrent breakdown of the SM normal state
and superconductivity at a pressure-induced quantum critical point in an
iron-pnictide superconductor, Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5. We find that,
upon suppressing the superconducting state by applying pressure, the power
exponent changes from 1 to 2, and the corresponding coefficient A, the slope of
the temperature-linear resistivity per FeAs layer, gradually diminishes. At a
critical pressure (12.5 GPa), A and Tc go to zero concurrently,where a quantum
phase transition (QPT) from a superconducting state with a SM normal state to a
non-superconducting Fermi liquid state takes place. Scaling analysis on the
results obtained from the pressurized 1048 superconductor reveals that A and Tc
have a positive relation, which exhibits a similarity with that is seen in
other chemically-doped unconventional superconductors, regardless of the type
of the tuning method (doping or pressurizing), the crystal structure, the bulk
or film superconductors and the nature of dopant. These results suggest that
there is a simple but powerful organizational principle of connecting the SM
normal state with the high-Tc superconductivity.

					<dc:description>  We describe a class of &quot;neighboring-blocks&quot; stabilizer quantum error
correction codes and demonstrate that such class of codes can be implemented in
a resource-efficient manner using a single ancilla and circular near-neighbor
qubit connectivity. We propose an implementation for syndrome-measurement
circuits for codes from the class and illustrate its workings for cases of
3-qubit repetition code, Laflamme's 5-qubit code, and Shor's 9-qubit code. For
3-qubit repetition code and Laflamme's 5-qubit code suggested scheme has the
property that it uses only native two-qubit CNS gates, which potentially
reduces the amount of non-correctable errors due to the shorter gate time.
Elements of the scheme can be used to implement surface code with
near-neighbour connectivity using single ancilla, as demonstrated in an
example. We developed efficient decoding procedures for repetition codes and
the Laflamme's 5-qubit code using a minimum weight-perfect matching approach to
account for the specific order of measurements in our scheme. The analysis of
noise levels for which the scheme could show improvements in the fidelity of a
stored logical qubit in the 3-qubit repetition code and Laflamme's 5-qubit code
cases is provided. We complement our results by realizing the developed scheme
for a 3-qubit code using an IBM quantum processor and the Laflamme's 5-qubit
code using the state-vector simulator.

					<dc:description>  Let $\ell$ be a prime number and $q$ be a power of $\ell$. Given an odd prime
number $p$ and an imaginary quadratic extension $F$ of the rational function
field $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$, let $\lambda_p(F)$ denote the Iwasawa
$\lambda$-invariant of the constant $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$. We show
that for any number $r&gt;0$ and all large enough values of $q\not\equiv
1\mod{p}$, there is a positive proportion of imaginary quadratic fields
$F/\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ with the property that $\lambda_p(F)\geq r$. The main
result is proved as a consequence of recent unconditional theorems of
Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland on the distribution of class groups of imaginary
quadratic function fields.

microwave quantum memory lack complete combination of high efficiency, long
storage time, noiselessness and multi-qubit capacity. Here we report an
efficient microwave broadband multimode quantum memory. The memory stores two
spectral modes of single photon level microwave radiation in on-chip system of
eight coplanar superconducting resonators. Single mode storage shows a power
efficiency of up to $60\pm 3\%$ at single photon energy and more than $73\pm
3\%$ at higher intensity. The demonstrated efficiency is an order of magnitude
larger than the previously reported multimode microwave quantum memory. The
noiseless character of the storage is confirmed by coherent state quantum
process tomography. The demonstrated results pave the way to further increase
in efficiency and hence building a practical multimode microwave memory for
superconducting quantum circuits.

					<dc:description>  Fine-grained object retrieval aims to learn discriminative representation to
retrieve visually similar objects. However, existing top-performing works
usually impose pairwise similarities on the semantic embedding spaces or design
a localization sub-network to continually fine-tune the entire model in limited
data scenarios, thus resulting in convergence to suboptimal solutions. In this
paper, we develop Fine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning (FRPT), which steers a
frozen pre-trained model to perform the fine-grained retrieval task from the
perspectives of sample prompting and feature adaptation. Specifically, FRPT
only needs to learn fewer parameters in the prompt and adaptation instead of
fine-tuning the entire model, thus solving the issue of convergence to
suboptimal solutions caused by fine-tuning the entire model. Technically, a
discriminative perturbation prompt (DPP) is introduced and deemed as a sample
prompting process, which amplifies and even exaggerates some discriminative
elements contributing to category prediction via a content-aware inhomogeneous
sampling operation. In this way, DPP can make the fine-grained retrieval task
aided by the perturbation prompts close to the solved task during the original
pre-training. Thereby, it preserves the generalization and discrimination of
representation extracted from input samples. Besides, a category-specific
awareness head is proposed and regarded as feature adaptation, which removes
the species discrepancies in features extracted by the pre-trained model using
category-guided instance normalization. And thus, it makes the optimized
features only include the discrepancies among subcategories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our FRPT with fewer learnable parameters achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used fine-grained datasets.

					<dc:description>  Precision measurement of quark Yukawa couplings is a crucial aspect of Higgs
property study. Proposed as a future upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) provides opportunities to
probe quark Yukawa couplings with a high precision because of relatively low
rate from QCD background as compared with that of the Higgs processes at the
LHC. For this purpose, it is important to have a precision prediction of the
Higgs production rate at the LHeC. The leading production channel of the Higgs
boson at the LHeC is via weak boson fusion (WBF) which has the unique kinematic
feature of forward tagging jets. Since there is no color exchange between the
forward-backward objects in WBF processes, electroweak radiative corrections
become particularly important. In this paper, we focus on the electroweak
radiative corrections at next-to-leading order for Higgs boson production in
the WBF channel at the LHeC. In the two renormalization schemes we use, the
loop corrections are respectively at the level of 9% and 18% relative to the
leading order result, and the next-to-leading calculation in both schemes agree
up to a truncation error expected from the perturbative method. The size of the
EW correction exceeds that from QCD radiations and is shown to be important for
the study of Higgs phenomenology.

					<dc:creator>Antonir, Asaf Cohen</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Let $N_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ denote the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an
$n$ vertex planar graph. The problem of bounding this function for various
graphs $H$ has been extensively studied since the 70's. A special case that
received a lot of attention recently is when $H$ is the path on $2m+1$
vertices, denoted $P_{2m+1}$. Our main result in this paper is that $$
N_{\mathcal{P}}(n,P_{2m+1})=O(m^{-m}n^{m+1})\;.$$ This improves upon the
previously best known bound by a factor $e^{m}$, which is best possible up to
the hidden constant, and makes a significant step towards resolving conjectures
of Gosh et al. and of Cox and Martin. The proof uses graph theoretic arguments
together with (simple) arguments from the theory of convex optimization.

					<dc:description>  Synchronous Flooding (SF) protocols can enhance the wireless connectivity
between Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, existing SF solutions fail
to introduce sufficient security measures due to strict time synchronisation
requirements, making them vulnerable to malicious actions. Our paper presents a
design paradigm for encrypted SF communications. We describe a mechanism for
synchronising encryption parameters in a network-wide fashion. Our solution
operates with minimal overhead and without compromising communication
reliability. Evaluating our paradigm on a real-world, large-scale IoT testbed,
we have proven that a communication layer impervious to a range of attacks is
established without sacrificing the network performance.

					<dc:description>  Why do brains have inhibitory connections? Why do deep networks have negative
weights? We believe representing functions is the primary role of both (i) the
brain in natural intelligence, and (ii) deep networks in artificial
intelligence. Our answer to why there are inhibitory/negative weights is: to
learn more functions. We prove that, in the absence of negative weights, neural
networks with non-decreasing activation functions are not universal
approximators. While this may be an intuitive result to some, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no formal theory, in either machine learning or
neuroscience, that demonstrates why negative weights are crucial in the context
of representation capacity. Further, we provide insights on the geometric
properties of the representation space that non-negative deep networks cannot
represent. We expect these insights will yield a deeper understanding of more
sophisticated inductive priors imposed on the distribution of weights that lead
to more efficient biological and machine learning.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work, Transition Probability Matrix (TPM) is proposed as a new method
for extracting the features of nodes in the graph. The proposed method uses
random walks to capture the connectivity structure of a node's close
neighborhood. The information obtained from random walks is converted to
anonymous walks to extract the topological features of nodes. In the embedding
process of nodes, anonymous walks are used since they capture the topological
similarities of connectivities better than random walks. Therefore the obtained
embedding vectors have richer information about the underlying connectivity
structure. The method is applied to node classification and link prediction
tasks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the
state-of-the-art algorithms in the recent literature. Moreover, the extracted
information about the connectivity structure of similar networks is used to
link prediction and node classification tasks for a completely new graph.

					<dc:title>Counterfactual Fairness Is Basically Demographic Parity</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Making fair decisions is crucial to ethically implementing machine learning
algorithms in social settings. In this work, we consider the celebrated
definition of counterfactual fairness [Kusner et al., NeurIPS, 2017]. We begin
by showing that an algorithm which satisfies counterfactual fairness also
satisfies demographic parity, a far simpler fairness constraint. Similarly, we
show that all algorithms satisfying demographic parity can be trivially
modified to satisfy counterfactual fairness. Together, our results indicate
that counterfactual fairness is basically equivalent to demographic parity,
which has important implications for the growing body of work on counterfactual
fairness. We then validate our theoretical findings empirically, analyzing
three existing algorithms for counterfactual fairness against three simple
benchmarks. We find that two simple benchmark algorithms outperform all three
existing algorithms -- in terms of fairness, accuracy, and efficiency -- on
several data sets. Our analysis leads us to formalize a concrete fairness goal:
to preserve the order of individuals within protected groups. We believe
transparency around the ordering of individuals within protected groups makes
fair algorithms more trustworthy. By design, the two simple benchmark
algorithms satisfy this goal while the existing algorithms for counterfactual
fairness do not.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous robots combine skills to form increasingly complex behaviors,
called missions. While skills are often programmed at a relatively low
abstraction level, their coordination is architecturally separated and often
expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. State machines have been the
go-to language to model behavior for decades, but recently, behavior trees have
gained attention among roboticists. Although several implementations of
behavior trees are in use, little is known about their usage and scope in the
real world.How do concepts offered by behavior trees relate to traditional
languages, such as state machines? How are concepts in behavior trees and state
machines used in actual applications? This paper is a study of the key language
concepts in behavior trees as realized in domain-specific languages (DSLs),
internal and external DSLs offered as libraries, and their use in open-source
robotic applications supported by the Robot Operating System (ROS). We analyze
behavior-tree DSLs and compare them to the standard language for behavior
models in robotics:state machines. We identify DSLs for both behavior-modeling
languages, and we analyze five in-depth.We mine open-source repositories for
robotic applications that use the analyzed DSLs and analyze their usage. We
identify similarities between behavior trees and state machines in terms of
language design and the concepts offered to accommodate the needs of the
robotics domain. We observed that the usage of behavior-tree DSLs in
open-source projects is increasing rapidly. We observed similar usage patterns
at model structure and at code reuse in the behavior-tree and state-machine
models within the mined open-source projects. We contribute all extracted
models as a dataset, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop
behavior trees, associated tools, and analysis techniques.

					<dc:description>  When applying an external magnetic field to a superconductor, orbital and
Pauli paramagnetic pairbreaking effects govern the limit of the upper critical
magnetic field that can be supported before superconductivity breaks down.
Experimental studies have shown that many multiband superconductors exhibit
values of the upper critical magnetic field that violate the theoretically
predicted limit, giving rise to many studies treating the underlying mechanisms
that allow this. In this work we consider spin-splitting induced by an external
magnetic field in a superconductor with two relevant bands close to the Fermi
level, and show that the presence of interband superconducting pairing produces
high-field reentrant superconductivity violating the
Pauli-Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit for the value of the upper critical magnetic
field.

					<dc:description>  We develop a formalism for constructing particle-number-conserving Gaussian
fermionic projected entangled pair states [U(1)-GfPEPS] and show that these
states can describe ground states of band insulators and gapless fermions with
band touching points. When using them as variational Ans\&quot;{a}tze for two Dirac
fermion systems ($\pi$-flux model on the square lattice and $[0,\pi]$-flux
model on the kagome lattice), we find that the U(1)-GfPEPS, even with a
relatively small bond dimension, can accurately approximate the Dirac Fermi sea
ground states. By applying Gutzwiller projectors on top of these U(1)-GfPEPS,
we obtain PEPS representation of U(1)-Dirac spin liquid states for spin-1/2
systems. With state-of-the-art tensor network numerics, the critical exponent
in the spin-spin correlation function of the Gutzwiller-projected $\pi$-flux
state is estimated to be $\eta \approx 1.7$.

					<dc:title>Visualizing the (Causal) Effect of a Continuous Variable on a
  Time-To-Event Outcome</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Visualization is a key aspect of communicating the results of any study
aiming to estimate causal effects. In studies with time-to-event outcomes, the
most popular visualization approach is depicting survival curves stratified by
the variable of interest. This approach cannot be used when the variable of
interest is continuous. Simple workarounds, such as categorizing the continuous
covariate and plotting survival curves for each category, can result in
misleading depictions of the main effects. Instead, we propose a new graphic,
the survival area plot, to directly depict the survival probability over time
and as a function of a continuous covariate simultaneously. This plot utilizes
g-computation based on a suitable time-to-event model to obtain the relevant
estimates. Through the use of g-computation, those estimates can be adjusted
for confounding without additional effort, allowing a causal interpretation
under the standard causal identifiability assumptions. If those assumptions are
not met, the proposed plot may still be used to depict noncausal associations.
We illustrate and compare the proposed graphics to simpler alternatives using
data from a large German observational study investigating the effect of the
Ankle Brachial Index on survival. To facilitate the usage of these plots, we
additionally developed the contsurvplot R-package which includes all methods
discussed in this paper.

					<dc:description>  Teams are central to human accomplishment. Over the past half-century,
psychologists have identified the Big-Five cross-culturally valid personality
variables: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and
Agreeableness. The first four have shown consistent relationships with team
performance. Agreeableness (being harmonious, altruistic, humble, and
cooperative), however, has demonstrated a non-significant and highly variable
relationship with team performance. We resolve this inconsistency through
computational modelling. An agent-based model (ABM) is used to predict the
effects of personality traits on teamwork and a genetic algorithm is then used
to explore the limits of the ABM in order to discover which traits correlate
with best and worst performing teams for a problem with different levels of
uncertainty (noise). New dependencies revealed by the exploration are
corroborated by analyzing previously-unseen data from one the largest datasets
on team performance to date comprising 3,698 individuals in 593 teams working
on more than 5,000 group tasks with and without uncertainty, collected over a
10-year period. Our finding is that the dependency between team performance and
Agreeableness is moderated by task uncertainty. Combining evolutionary
computation with ABMs in this way provides a new methodology for the scientific
investigation of teamwork, making new predictions, and improving our
understanding of human behaviors. Our results confirm the potential usefulness
of computer modelling for developing theory, as well as shedding light on the
future of teams as work environments are becoming increasingly fluid and
uncertain.

					<dc:description>  Although the problem of hallucinations in neural machine translation (NMT)
has received some attention, research on this highly pathological phenomenon
lacks solid ground. Previous work has been limited in several ways: it often
resorts to artificial settings where the problem is amplified, it disregards
some (common) types of hallucinations, and it does not validate adequacy of
detection heuristics. In this paper, we set foundations for the study of NMT
hallucinations. First, we work in a natural setting, i.e., in-domain data
without artificial noise neither in training nor in inference. Next, we
annotate a dataset of over 3.4k sentences indicating different kinds of
critical errors and hallucinations. Then, we turn to detection methods and both
revisit methods used previously and propose using glass-box uncertainty-based
detectors. Overall, we show that for preventive settings, (i) previously used
methods are largely inadequate, (ii) sequence log-probability works best and
performs on par with reference-based methods. Finally, we propose
DeHallucinator, a simple method for alleviating hallucinations at test time
that significantly reduces the hallucinatory rate. To ease future research, we
release our annotated dataset for WMT18 German-English data, along with the
model, training data, and code.

					<dc:description>  As we are entering the era of constructing practical quantum computers,
suppressing the inevitable noise to accomplish reliable computational tasks
will be the primary goal. Leakage noise, as the amplitude population leaking
outside the qubit subspace, is a particularly damaging source of error that
error correction approaches cannot handle. However, the impact of this noise on
the performance of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a type of near-term
quantum algorithms that is naturally resistant to a variety of noises, is yet
unknown. Here, {we consider a typical scenario with the widely used
hardware-efficient ansatz and the emergence of leakage in two-qubit gates},
observing that leakage noise generally reduces the expressive power of VQAs.
Furthermore, we benchmark the influence of leakage noise on VQAs in real-world
learning tasks. Results show that, both for data fitting and data
classification, leakage noise generally has a negative impact on the training
process and final outcomes. Our findings give strong evidence that VQAs are
vulnerable to leakage noise in most cases, implying that leakage noise must be
effectively suppressed in order to achieve practical quantum computing
applications, whether for near-term quantum algorithms and long-term
error-correcting quantum computing.

					<dc:description>  We discuss the discovery prospects for kg-scale dark matter with a
Yukawa-like long-range interaction in Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector
(KAGRA). We consider the interaction range to be in the order of kilometers,
thus the dark matter may interact with multiple KAGRA mirrors simultaneously.
The induced signal strain is in many cases dominated by frequencies below about
130 Hz. Due to the geometry of the detector there is some strong directional
sensitivity. It turns out that KAGRA would be able to constrain such kind of
dark matter within a few years of operation. With our set of assumptions we
expect that KAGRA could detect a few events per year for 10 kg dark matter,
with a Yukawa interaction with a range of 10 km and an effective coupling
constant around $10^6$.

					<dc:description>  In the classic multi-stage Stern$-$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and
Segr\`e, the Majorana (Landau$-$Zener) and Rabi formulae diverge afar from the
experimental observation while the physical mechanism for electron-spin
collapse remains unidentified. Here, introducing the physical co-quantum
concept provides a plausible physical mechanism and predicts the experimental
observation in absolute units without fitting (i.e., no parameters adjusted)
with a p-value less than one per million, which is the probability that the
co-quantum theory happens to match the experimental observation purely by
chance. Further, the co-quantum concept is corroborated by statistically
reproducing exactly the wave function, density operator, and uncertainty
relation for electron spin in Stern$-$Gerlach experiments.

					<dc:description>  This work is concerned with epidemiological models defined on networks, which
highlight the prominent role of the social contact network of a given
population in the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, we address the
modelling and analysis of very large networks. As a basic epidemiological
model, we focus on a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed) model
governing the behaviour of infectious disease among a population of
individuals, which is partitioned into sub-populations. We study the long-time
behaviour of the dynamic for this model, also taking into account the
heterogeneity of the infections and the social network. By relying on the
theory of graphons, we address the natural question of the large population
limit and investigate the behaviour of the model as the size of the network
tends to infinitely. After establishing the existence and uniqueness of
solutions to the selected models, we discuss the use of the graphon-based limit
model as a generative model for a network with particular statistical
properties related to the distribution of connections. We also provide some
preliminary numerical tests.

However, it is hard to generate diverse, challenging, and realistic
unstructured terrains in simulation, which limits the way researchers evaluate
their locomotion policies. In this paper, we prototype the generation of a
terrain dataset via terrain authoring and active learning, and the learned
samplers can stably generate diverse high-quality terrains. We expect the
generated dataset to make a terrain-robustness benchmark for legged locomotion.
The dataset, the code implementation, and some policy evaluations are released

					<dc:description>  Quantum Bayesian Computation (QBC) is an emerging field that levers the
computational gains available from quantum computers to provide an exponential
speed-up in Bayesian computation. Our paper adds to the literature in two ways.
First, we show how von Neumann quantum measurement can be used to simulate
machine learning algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Deep
Learning (DL) that are fundamental to Bayesian learning. Second, we describe
data encoding methods needed to implement quantum machine learning including
the counterparts to traditional feature extraction and kernel embeddings
methods. Our goal then is to show how to apply quantum algorithms directly to
statistical machine learning problems. On the theoretical side, we provide
quantum versions of high dimensional regression, Gaussian processes (Q-GP) and
stochastic gradient descent (Q-SGD). On the empirical side, we apply a Quantum
FFT model to Chicago housing data. Finally, we conclude with directions for
future research.

					<dc:description>  We discuss how in $SO(10)$ grand unification an observable number density of
topologically stable intermediate mass ( $\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) monopoles survive
inflation driven by a Coleman-Weinberg potential and non-minimal coupling of
the inflaton field to gravity. The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is in excellent
agreement with the current observations, and the tensor to scalar ratio
$r\gtrsim 0.003$. The model also predicts the presence of intermediate scale
topologically stable cosmic strings, and their gravitational wave spectrum
reflects the amount of cosmic inflation experienced by the associated symmetry
breaking. The discovery of these primordial monopoles and the stochastic
gravitational wave background from the strings would provide important new
insights regarding the symmetry breaking patterns in the early universe.

					<dc:description>  Open Access (OA) facilitates access to articles. But, authors or funders
often must pay the publishing costs preventing authors who do not receive
financial support from participating in OA publishing and citation advantage
for OA articles. OA may exacerbate existing inequalities in the publication
system rather than overcome them. To investigate this, we studied 522,411
articles published by Springer Nature. Employing correlation and regression
analyses, we describe the relationship between authors affiliated with
countries from different income levels, their choice of publishing model, and
the citation impact of their papers. A machine learning classification method
helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the
publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for APC waivers
publish more in gold-OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for
an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the
assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in
gold-OA journals. We found a strong correlation between the journal rank and
the publishing model in gold-OA journals, whereas the OA option is mostly
avoided in hybrid journals. Also, results show that the countries' income
level, seniority, and experience with OA publications are the most predictive
factors for OA publishing in hybrid journals.

					<dc:description>  We consider a semi-classical heat engine with a $q$-deformed quantum
oscillator working substance and classical thermal baths. We investigate the
influence of the quantum statistical deformation parameter $q$ on the work and
efficiency of the engine. In usual heat engines, a Hamiltonian parameter is
varied during the work injection and extraction stages while the quantum
statistical character of the working substance remains fixed. We point out that
even if the Hamiltonian parameters are not changing, work can be harvested by
quantum statistical changes of the working substance. Work extraction from
thermal resources using quantum statistical mutations of the working substance
makes a semi-classical engine cycle without any classical analog. As a concrete
example of such a semi-classical heat engine with a profound quantum character,
we consider the Otto cycle and use the deformation parameter to define the
isentropic steps while keeping the Hamiltonian parameters constant. We verify
that our conclusion applies to both bosonic and fermionic oscillator
deformations.

					<dc:description>  Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect
severe medical events such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders.
Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot
be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously
estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning
model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw
photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested
subject-independently and compared to baseline in four datasets (BIDMC,
CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64
seconds). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean
absolute errors at optimal window size of 1.66 \pm 1.01, 1.59 \pm 1.08, 1.92
\pm 0.96 and 1.23 \pm 0.61 breaths per minute for each dataset. In remote
monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI datasets, we apply
transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU datasets as
pretraining datasets, reducing the MAE by up to 21$\%$. This shows that this
model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable
devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the
context of telemedicine and at home.

					<dc:description>  Fluctuations in Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest transmission towards
high-$z$ quasars are partially sourced from spatial fluctuations in the
ultraviolet background (UVB), the level of which are set by the mean free path
of ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$). The auto-correlation function of
Ly$\alpha$ forest flux characterizes the strength and scale of transmission
fluctuations and, as we show, is thus sensitive to $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$.
Recent measurements at $z \sim 6$ suggest a rapid evolution of
$\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ at $z&gt;5.0$ which would leave a signature in the
evolution of the auto-correlation function. For this forecast, we model mock
Ly$\alpha$ forest data with properties similar to the XQR-30 extended data set
at $5.4 \leq z \leq 6.0$. At each $z$ we investigate 100 mock data sets and an
ideal case where mock data matches model values of the auto-correlation
function. For ideal data with $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}=9.0$ cMpc at $z=6.0$, we
recover $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}=12^{+6}_{-3}$ cMpc. This precision is comparable
to direct measurements of $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ from the stacking of quasar
spectra beyond the Lyman limit. Hypothetical high-resolution data leads to a
$\sim40\%$ reduction in the error bars over all $z$. The distribution of mock
values of the auto-correlation function in this work is highly non-Gaussian for
high-$z$, which should caution work with other statistics of the high-$z$
Ly$\alpha$ forest against making this assumption. We use a rigorous statistical
method to pass an inference test, however future work on non-Gaussian methods
will enable higher precision measurements.

					<dc:description>  The limited over-the-air (OTA) pilot symbols in
multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems presents a major challenge for detecting transmitted data
symbols at the receiver, especially for machine learning-based approaches.
While it is crucial to explore effective ways to exploit pilots, one can also
take advantage of the data symbols to improve detection performance. Thus, this
paper introduces an online attention-based approach, namely RC-AttStructNet-DF,
that can efficiently utilize pilot symbols and be dynamically updated with the
detected payload data using the decision feedback (DF) mechanism. Reservoir
computing (RC) is employed in the time domain network to facilitate efficient
online training. The frequency domain network adopts the novel 2D multi-head
attention (MHA) module to capture the time and frequency correlations, and the
structural-based StructNet to facilitate the DF mechanism. The attention loss
is designed to learn the frequency domain network. The DF mechanism further
enhances detection performance by dynamically tracking the channel changes
through detected data symbols. The effectiveness of the RC-AttStructNet-DF
approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments in MIMO-OFDM and massive
MIMO-OFDM systems with different modulation orders and under various scenarios.

					<dc:description>  Video object detection (VID) is challenging because of the high variation of
object appearance as well as the diverse deterioration in some frames. On the
positive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with that
in a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate
features across different frames is pivotal to VID problem. Most of existing
aggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. However, these
detectors are usually computationally expensive due to their two-stage nature.
This work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above
concerns, which costs marginal overheads with significant gains in accuracy.
Concretely, different from traditional two-stage pipeline, we select important
regions after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality
candidates. Besides, we evaluate the relationship between a target frame and
reference frames to guide the aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments and
ablation studies to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its
superiority over other state-of-the-art VID approaches in both effectiveness
and efficiency. Our YOLOX-based model can achieve promising performance
(\emph{e.g.}, 87.5\% AP50 at over 30 FPS on the ImageNet VID dataset on a
single 2080Ti GPU), making it attractive for large-scale or real-time
applications. The implementation is simple, we have made the demo codes and
models available at \url{https://github.com/YuHengsss/YOLOV}.

					<dc:description>  With the advent of near-term quantum computers, the simulation of properties
of solids using quantum algorithms becomes possible. By an adequate description
of the system's Hamiltonian, variational methods enable to fetch the band
structure and other fundamental properties as transition probabilities. Here,
we use k$\cdot$p Hamiltonians to describe semiconductor structures of the III-V
family and obtain their band structures using a state vector solver, a
probabilistic simulator, and a real noisy-device simulator. The resulting band
structures are in good agreement with the ones obtained by direct
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. Simulation times depend on the optimizer,
circuit depth, and simulator used. Finally, with the optimized eigenstates, we
convey the inter-band absorption probability, demonstrating the possibility of
analyzing the fundamental properties of crystalline systems using quantum
computers.

					<dc:description>  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful tool for training
automated systems acting independently in a common environment. However, it can
lead to sub-optimal behavior when individual incentives and group incentives
diverge. Humans are remarkably capable at solving these social dilemmas. It is
an open problem in MARL to replicate such cooperative behaviors in selfish
agents. In this work, we draw upon the idea of formal contracting from
economics to overcome diverging incentives between agents in MARL. We propose
an augmentation to a Markov game where agents voluntarily agree to binding
state-dependent transfers of reward, under pre-specified conditions. Our
contributions are theoretical and empirical. First, we show that this
augmentation makes all subgame-perfect equilibria of all fully observed Markov
games exhibit socially optimal behavior, given a sufficiently rich space of
contracts. Next, we complement our game-theoretic analysis by showing that
state-of-the-art RL algorithms learn socially optimal policies given our
augmentation. Our experiments include classic static dilemmas like Stag Hunt,
Prisoner's Dilemma and a public goods game, as well as dynamic interactions
that simulate traffic, pollution management and common pool resource
management.

					<dc:description>  pystacked implements stacked generalization (Wolpert, 1992) for regression
and binary classification via Python's scikit-learn. Stacking combines multiple
supervised machine learners -- the &quot;base&quot; or &quot;level-0&quot; learners -- into a
single learner. The currently supported base learners include regularized
regression, random forest, gradient boosted trees, support vector machines, and
feed-forward neural nets (multi-layer perceptron). pystacked can also be used
with as a `regular' machine learning program to fit a single base learner and,
thus, provides an easy-to-use API for scikit-learn's machine learning
algorithms.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Analysis of PDEs</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the
Dirichlet problem for an elliptic equation with a drift $b$ satisfying
$\operatorname{div} b\le 0$ in $\Omega$. We assume $b$ belongs to some weak
Morrey class which includes in the 3D case, in particular, drifts having a
singularity along the axis $x_3$ with the asymptotic $b(x)\sim c/r$, where
$r=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$.

					<dc:description>  We present a multi-modal spectroscopic paradigm that enables independent
measurement of charge and spin degrees of freedom (DOF) in strongly correlated
materials. This spin-based technique probes symmetry-specific Hamiltonian
parameters by analyzing how the time delay between applied pulses ($\tau$)
affects the response. We demonstrate ways in which charge DOF that couple
through the quadrupolar interaction (inversion symmetric) can be independently
measured even in the presence of large magnetic noise (inversion asymmetric).
The method quantifies both the strength of the interactions and its
distribution (noise). We provide protocols to directly and independently
measure the distribution of interaction strengths, even when the average value
of the interaction is zero. By independently measuring distributions of
different forms of disorder, this methodology can elucidate which microscopic
symmetry drives a phase transition. We discuss potential applications to study
complex phase transitions in strongly interacting quantum materials.

					<dc:description>  We study the possibility of generating baryon asymmetry of the universe from
dark matter (DM) annihilations during non-standard cosmological epochs.
Considering the DM to be of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) type,
the generation of baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis route is studied where WIMP
DM annihilation produces a non-zero lepton asymmetry. Adopting a minimal
particle physics model to realise this along with non-zero light neutrino
masses, we consider three different types of non-standard cosmic history
namely, (i) fast expanding universe, (ii) early matter domination and (iii)
scalar-tensor theory of gravity. By solving the appropriate Boltzmann equations
incorporating such non-standard history, we find that the allowed parameter
space consistent with DM relic and observed baryon asymmetry gets enlarged with
the possibility of lower DM mass in some scenarios. While such lighter DM can
face further scrutiny at direct search experiments, the non-standard epochs
offer complementary probes on their own.

					<dc:description>  The notion of aggregator oblivious (AO) security for privacy preserving data
aggregation was formalized with a specific construction of AO-secure blinding
technique over a cyclic group by Shi et al. Some of proposals of data
aggregation protocols use the blinding technique of Shi et al. for BGN
cryptosystem, an additive homomorphic encryption. Previously, there have been
some security analysis on some of BGN based data aggregation protocols in the
context of integrity or authenticity of data. Even with such security analysis,
the BGN cryptosystem has been a popular building block of privacy preserving
data aggregation protocol. In this paper, we study the privacy issues in the
blinding technique of Shi et al. used for BGN cryptosystem. We show that the
blinding techniques for the BGN cryptosystem used in several protocols are not
privacy preserving against the recipient, the decryptor. Our analysis is based
on the fact that the BGN cryptosystem uses a pairing e:GxG--&gt;G_T and the
existence of the pairing makes the DDH problem on G easy to solve. We also
suggest how to prevent such privacy leakage in the blinding technique of Shi et
al. used for BGN cryptosystem.

					<dc:description>  In this article, we discuss a new software package of kinematic and vertex
fitting for the CMD-3 experiment at the VEPP-2000 electron-positron collider.
The authors describe in detail the fitting algorithm, parametrization of
four-momenta and trajectories of various particles and present the results of
testing the fitting package using events of Monte Carlo simulation of various
$e^+e^-$ annihilation processes. The authors also provide several examples of
the fitting package validation using Gaussian simulation. Although the package
discussed in this article is intended for the CMD-3 experiment, it can also be
used in other experiments. The authors consider the described package as their
first step towards a more universal and rigrous kinematic and vertex fitting
package that can be used in future $e^+e^-$ experiments, such as the Super
Charm-Tau factory.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we revisit the gravitational eikonal amplitudes of two
scattering spinning particles and inspect their scrambling power in the spin
spaces that is quantified through the tripartite information. We found that in
the non-relativistic limit and a special high-energy limit the leading
contribution is a quantity that is universal and theory independent. The
minimal coupling is singled out with minimal scrambling in a different high
momenta limit. We also inspected the initial state dependence of entanglement
generation and found that the spin coherent state with vanishing spin may not
necessarily be the hardest to entangle. Interestingly, among a family of mixed
states, the only P-rep state there known to be the best approximation of
classical mixed states was singled out as one with minimal entanglement
generated.

					<dc:description>  We introduce generalized Hessenberg varieties and establish basic facts. We
show that the Tymoczko action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the cohomology of
Hessenberg varieties extends to generalized Hessenberg varieties and that
natural morphisms among them preserve the action. By analyzing natural
morphisms and birational maps among generalized Hessenberg varieties, we give
an elementary proof of the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture. Moreover we present a
natural generalization of the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture that involves
generalized Hessenberg varieties and provide an elementary proof. As a
byproduct, we propose a generalized Stanley-Stembridge conjecture for weighted
graphs. Our investigation into the birational geometry of generalized
Hessenberg varieties enables us to modify them into much simpler varieties like
projective spaces or permutohedral varieties by explicit sequences of blowups
or projective bundle maps. Using this, we provide two algorithms to compute the
$S_n$-representations on the cohomology of generalized Hessenberg varieties. As
an application, we compute representations on the low degree cohomology of some
Hessenberg varieties.

					<dc:description>  Our recent research shows that the design philosophy of human factors science
in the intelligence age is expanding from &quot;user-centered design&quot; to
&quot;human-centered AI&quot;. The human-machine relationship presents a trans-era
evolution from &quot;human-machine interaction&quot; to &quot;human-machine/AI teaming&quot;. These
changes have raised new questions and challenges for human factors science. The
interdisciplinary field of human factors science includes any work that adopts
a human-centered approach, such as human factors, ergonomics, engineering
psychology, and human-computer interaction. These changes compell us to
re-examine current human factors science's paradigms and research agenda.
Existing research paradigms are primarily based on non-intelligent
technologies. In this context, this paper reviews the evolution of the
paradigms of human factors science. It summarizes the new conceptual models and
frameworks we recently proposed to enrich the research paradigms for human
factors science, including a human-agent teaming model, a human-agent joint
cognitive ecosystem framework, and an intelligent sociotechnical systems
framework. This paper further enhances these concepts and looks forward to the
application of these concepts. This paper also looks forward to the future
research agenda of human factors science in the areas of &quot;human-AI
interaction&quot;, &quot;intelligent human-machine interface&quot;, and &quot;human-machine/AI
teaming&quot;. It analyzes the role of the research paradigms on the future research
agenda. We believe that the research paradigms and agenda of human factors
science influence and promote each other. Human factors science in the
intelligence age needs diversified and innovative research paradigms, thereby
further promoting the research and application of human factors science.

					<dc:title>A Framework for Inherently Interpretable Optimization Models</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  With dramatic improvements in optimization software, the solution of
large-scale problems that seemed intractable decades ago are now a routine
task. This puts even more real-world applications into the reach of optimizers.
At the same time, solving optimization problems often turns out to be one of
the smaller difficulties when putting solutions into practice. One major
barrier is that the optimization software can be perceived as a black box,
which may produce solutions of high quality, but can create completely
different solutions when circumstances change leading to low acceptance of
optimized solutions. Such issues of interpretability and explainability have
seen significant attention in other areas, such as machine learning, but less
so in optimization. In this paper we propose an optimization framework that
inherently comes with an easily interpretable optimization rule, that explains
under which circumstances certain solutions are chosen. Focusing on decision
trees to represent interpretable optimization rules, we propose integer
programming formulations as well as a heuristic method that ensure
applicability of our approach even for large-scale problems. Computational
experiments using random and real-world data indicate that the costs of
inherent interpretability can be very small.

					<dc:description>  Data-enabled cities are recently accelerated and enhanced with automated
learning for improved Smart Cities applications. In the context of an Internet
of Things (IoT) ecosystem, the data communication is frequently costly,
inefficient, not scalable and lacks security. Federated Learning (FL) plays a
pivotal role in providing privacy-preserving and communication efficient
Machine Learning (ML) frameworks. In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of
FL in the context of a Smart Cities Street Light Monitoring application. FL is
evaluated against benchmarks of centralised and (fully) personalised machine
learning techniques for the classification task of the lampposts operation.
Incorporating FL in such a scenario shows minimal performance reduction in
terms of the classification task, but huge improvements in the communication
cost and the privacy preserving. These outcomes strengthen FL's viability and
potential for IoT applications.

					<dc:description>  Rather than refining individual candidate solutions for a general non-convex
optimization problem, by analogy to evolution, we consider minimizing the
average loss of a parametric distribution over hypotheses. In this setting, we
prove that Fisher-Rao natural gradient descent (FR-NGD) optimally approximates
the continuous-time replicator equation, which is an essential model for
evolutionary dynamics, by minimizing the mean-squared error of relative
fitness. We term this finding &quot;conjugate natural selection&quot; and demonstrate its
utility by numerically solving an example non-convex optimization problem over
a continuous strategy space. Next, by developing known connections between
discrete-time replicator dynamics and Bayes's rule, we show that FR-NGD of the
KL-divergence of modeled predictions from observations in continuous time
provides the optimal approximation of continuous Bayesian inference. We use
this result to demonstrate a novel method for estimating the parameters of a
stochastic processes.

conformal volume, respectively. We also give an optimal sharp extrinsic upper

					<dc:description>  In these proceedings, we present the measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and
triangular ($v_3$) flow of (multi-)strange hadrons and $\phi$ mesons in 19.6
and 14.6 GeV Au+Au collisions from STAR. The number of constituent quark (NCQ)
scaling of $v_2$ and $v_3$ holds well at $\sqrt{ s_{\mathrm{ NN }} } $ = 19.6
GeV, which indicates the collective flow is built up in the partonic stage. At
these energies, the anti-particles show better NCQ scaling than the particles
for both $v_2$ and $v_3$, which may be caused by the different contributions
from the produced and transported quarks.

					<dc:description>  The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) method are widely used for foreground subtraction in 21 cm
intensity mapping experiments. We show their equivalence, and point out that
the condition for completely clean separation of foregrounds and cosmic 21 cm
signal using the PCA/SVD is unrealistic. We propose a PCA-based foreground
subtraction method, dubbed &quot;Singular Vector Projection (SVP)&quot; method, which
exploits a priori information of the left and/or right singular vectors of the
foregrounds. We demonstrate with simulation tests that this new, semi-blind
method can reduce the error of the recovered 21 cm signal by orders of
magnitude, even if only the left and/or right singular vectors in the largest
few modes are exploited. The SVP estimators provide a new, effective approach
for 21 cm observations to remove foregrounds and uncover the physics in the
cosmic 21 cm signal.

					<dc:description>  Existing techniques for image-to-image translation commonly have suffered
from two critical problems: heavy reliance on per-sample domain annotation
and/or inability of handling multiple attributes per image. Recent
truly-unsupervised methods adopt clustering approaches to easily provide
per-sample one-hot domain labels. However, they cannot account for the
real-world setting: one sample may have multiple attributes. In addition, the
semantics of the clusters are not easily coupled to the human understanding. To
overcome these, we present a LANguage-driven Image-to-image Translation model,
dubbed LANIT. We leverage easy-to-obtain candidate attributes given in texts
for a dataset: the similarity between images and attributes indicates
per-sample domain labels. This formulation naturally enables multi-hot label so
that users can specify the target domain with a set of attributes in language.
To account for the case that the initial prompts are inaccurate, we also
present prompt learning. We further present domain regularization loss that
enforces translated images be mapped to the corresponding domain. Experiments
on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that LANIT achieves comparable or
superior performance to existing models.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we explore interactions between neutrinos and Dark Matter. In
particular, we study how the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos can be
modified by computing the most general potential generated by the galactic DM
background. We use on-shell techniques to compute this potential in a
completely model independent way and obtain an expression valid for any Dark
Matter mass and spin. Afterwards, we use this expression to analyse under what
circumstances such potential can be important at the phenomenological level,
and we find that under some assumptions only ultra light scalar Dark Matter
could be of any relevance to oscillation experiments.

					<dc:description>  Gravitational waves travel through the distributions of matter and dark
energy during propagation. For this reason, gravitational waves emitted from
binary compact objects serve as a useful tool especially to probe the nature of
dark energy. The geometrical optics approximation is a conventional way of
investigating wave propagation. However, the approximation becomes less
accurate as the wavelength approaches the curvature radius of the background,
which can occur in generic situations. In this paper, we suggest a formulation
for higher-order corrections of the geometrical optics expansion, applied to
Horndeski theory which accommodates many dark energy models. At the level of
the background, assuming that the derivative of the scalar field is
non-vanishing and timelike, we choose the time slices to coincide with the
contours of the scalar field. This choice of the background time slices is
advantageous as the sound cones of both scalar and tensor gravitational waves
are upright with respect to the background time slices whenever the scalar
field behaves as a perfect fluid. We then analyze the equations of motion for
scalar and tensor components of gravitational waves at the leading and
next-to-leading order in the geometrical optics expansion, deriving the
evolution equations for their amplitudes under certain conditions. In
particular, for Generalized Brans-Dicke theories, we find a simple description
of equations for gravitational waves in terms of an effective metric.

					<dc:subject>Physics - Classical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It is evident that the positions of 4 bodies in $d&gt;2$ dimensional space can
be identified with vertices of a tetrahedron. Square of volume of the
tetrahedron, weighted sum of squared areas of four facets and weighted sum of
squared edges are called the volume variables. A family of
translation-invariant potentials which depend on volume variables alone is
considered as well as solutions of the Newton equations which solely depend on
volume variables. For the case of zero angular momentum $L=0$ the corresponding
Hamiltonian, which describes these solutions, is derived. Three examples are
studied in detail: (I) the (super)integrable 4-body closed chain of harmonic
oscillators for $d&gt;2$ (the harmonic molecule), (II) a generic, two volume
variable dependent potential whose trajectories possess a constant moment of
inertia ($d&gt;1$), and (III) the 4-body anharmonic oscillator for $d \geq 1$.
This work is the second of the sequel: the first one [IJMPA 36, No. 18 (2021)]
was dedicated to study the 3-body classical problem in volume variables.

					<dc:description>  Kirchhoff showed that the number of spanning trees of a graph is the spectral
determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian divided by the number of vertices;
we reframe this result in the quantum graph setting. We prove that the spectral
determinant of the Laplace operator on a finite connected metric graph with
standard (Neummann-Kirchhoff) vertex conditions determines the number of
spanning trees when the lengths of the edges of the metric graph are
sufficiently close together. To obtain this result, we analyze an equilateral
quantum graph whose spectrum is closely related to spectra of discrete graph
operators and then use the continuity of the spectral determinant under
perturbations of the edge lengths.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we explore the effects of a quantum quench on the circuit
complexity for a quenched quantum field theory having weakly coupled quartic
interaction. We use the invariant operator method, under a perturbative
framework, for computing the ground state of this system}. We give the
analytical expressions for specific reference and target states using the
ground state of the system. Using a particular cost functional, we show the
analytical computation of circuit complexity for the quenched and interacting
field theory. Further, we give a numerical estimate of circuit complexity with
respect to the quench rate, $\delta t$ for two coupled oscillators. The
parametric variation of the unambiguous contribution of the circuit complexity
for an arbitrary number of oscillators has been studied with respect to the
dimensionless parameter $(t/\delta t$). We comment on the variation of circuit
complexity for different values of coupling strength, different number of
oscillators, and even in different dimensions.

					<dc:description>  We develop a method of variational optimization of the infinite projected

automatic differentiation of the honeycomb-lattice corner transfer matrix
renormalization group. We apply the approach to the antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg spin-1/2 and ferromagnetic Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice.
The developed formalism gives quantitatively accurate results for the main

terms in the evolution of mHz GW sources {during the inspiral stage of massive
binaries}. We use the accuracy of currently available analytical waveform
models as a benchmark {value, finding} the following trends: the largest
unmodelled phase contributions are likely environmental rather than PN for
binaries lighter than $\sim 10^7/(1+z)^2$~M$_{\odot}$, where $z$ is the
redshift. Binaries heavier than $\sim 10^8/(1+z)$~M$_{\odot}$ do not require
more accurate {inspiral} waveforms due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
For high-SNR sources, environmental {phase contributions} are relevant at low
redshift, while high-order vacuum templates are required at $z &gt; 4$. Led by
these findings, we argue that including environmental effects in waveform
models should be prioritised in order to maximize the science yield of future
mHz detectors.

					<dc:description>  Modeling symptom progression to identify informative subjects for a new
Huntington's disease clinical trial is problematic since time to diagnosis, a
key covariate, can be heavily censored. Imputation is an appealing strategy
where censored covariates are replaced with their conditional means, but
existing methods saw over 200% bias under heavy censoring. Calculating these
conditional means well requires estimating and then integrating over the
survival function of the censored covariate from the censored value to
infinity. To flexibly estimate the survival function, existing methods use the
semiparametric Cox model with Breslow's estimator. Then, for integration, the
trapezoidal rule is used, but the trapezoidal rule is not designed for improper
integrals and leads to bias. We propose calculating the conditional mean with
adaptive quadrature instead, which can handle the improper integral. Yet, even
with adaptive quadrature, the integrand (the survival function) is undefined
beyond the observed data, so we identify the &quot;Weibull extension&quot; as the best
method to extrapolate and then integrate. In simulation studies, we show that
replacing the trapezoidal rule with adaptive quadrature and adopting the
Weibull extension corrects the bias seen with existing methods. We further show
how imputing with corrected conditional means helps to prioritize patients for
future clinical trials.

					<dc:description>  Finding a Maximum Clique is a classic property test from graph theory; find
any one of the largest complete subgraphs in an Erd{\&quot;o}s-R{\'e}nyi $G(N,p)$
random graph. It is the simplest of many such problems in which algorithms
requiring only a small power of $N$ steps cannot reach solutions which
probabilistic arguments show must exist, exposing an inherently &quot;hard&quot; phase
within the solution space of the problem. Such &quot;hard&quot; phases are seen in many
NP-Complete problems, in the limit when $N \to \infty$. But optimization
problems arise and must be solved at finite N. We use this simplest case,
MaxClique, to explore the structure of the problem as a function of $N$ and
$K$, the clique size. It displays a complex phase boundary, a staircase of
steps at each of which $2 \log_2N$ and $K_{\text{max}}$, the maximum size of
clique that can be found, increase by $1$. Each of its boundaries have finite
width, and these widths allow local algorithms to find cliques beyond the
limits defined by the study of infinite systems. We explore the performance of
a number of extensions of traditional fast local algorithms, and find that much
of the &quot;hard&quot; space remains accessible at finite $N$.
  The &quot;hidden clique&quot; problem embeds a clique somewhat larger than those which
occur naturally in a $G(N,p)$ random graph. Since such a clique is unique, we
find that local searches which stop early, once evidence for the hidden clique
is found, may outperform the best message passing or spectral algorithms.

					<dc:description>  We analysed the parsec-scale linear polarization properties of 436 active
galactic nuclei (AGN) based on 15 GHz polarimetric Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) observations. We present polarization and total intensity images
averaged over at least five epochs since 1996 January 19 through 2019 August 4.
Stacking improves the image sensitivity down to $\sim$30 $\mu$Jy/beam and
effectively fills out the jet cross-section both in total intensity and linear
polarization. It delineates the long-term persistent magnetic field
configuration and its regularity by restoring spatial distributions of the
electric vector position angle (EVPA) and fractional polarization,
respectively. On average, about ten years of stacking period is needed to
reveal the stable and most-complete polarization distribution of a source. We
find that the degree of polarization significantly increases down and across
the jet towards its edges, typically manifesting U or W-shaped transverse
profiles, suggesting a presence of a large-scale helical magnetic field
associated with the outflow. In some AGN jets, mainly BL Lacs, we detect
quasi-constant fractional polarization profiles across the jet, accompanied by
EVPAs that closely follow the outflow. BL Lacs show higher fractional
polarization values in their cores and jets than those in quasars up to
hectoparsec de-projected scales, while on larger scales, they become
comparable. High-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac jets are found to be less polarized
than intermediate and low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. The spatial distribution
of the EVPAs in BL Lacs tend to align with the local jet direction, while
quasars show an excess of orthogonal polarization orientation.

					<dc:description>  Local foliations of area constrained Willmore surfaces on a 3-dimensional
Riemannian manifold were constructed by Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and Ikoma,
Machiodi and Mondino, the leaves of these foliations are, in particular,
critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in case they are contained in a totally
geodesic spacelike hypersurface. We generalize these foliations to the general
case of a non-totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface, constructing a unique
local foliation of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy. A
discrepancy when evaluating the so called small sphere limit of the Hawking
energy was found by Friedrich. He studied concentrations of area constrained
critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and obtained a result that apparently
differs from the well established small sphere limit of the Hawking energy of
Horowitz and Schmidt, this small sphere limit in principle must be satisfied by
any quasi local energy. We independently confirm the discrepancy and explain
the reasons for it to happen. We also prove that these surfaces are suitable to
evaluate the Hawking energy in the sense of Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and we
find an indication that these surfaces may induce an excess in the energy
measured.

					<dc:description>  Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (or ASD), is a neurological
disorder. Its main symptoms include difficulty in (verbal and/or non-verbal)
communication, and rigid/repetitive behavior. These symptoms are often
indistinguishable from a normal (control) individual, due to which this
disorder remains undiagnosed in early childhood leading to delayed treatment.
Since the learning curve is steep during the initial age, an early diagnosis of
autism could allow to take adequate interventions at the right time, which
might positively affect the growth of an autistic child. Further, the
traditional methods of autism diagnosis require multiple visits to a
specialized psychiatrist, however this process can be time-consuming. In this
paper, we present a learning based approach to automate autism diagnosis using
simple and small action video clips of subjects. This task is particularly
challenging because the amount of annotated data available is small, and the
variations among samples from the two categories (ASD and control) are
generally indistinguishable. This is also evident from poor performance of a
binary classifier learned using the cross-entropy loss on top of a baseline
encoder. To address this, we adopt contrastive feature learning in both self
supervised and supervised learning frameworks, and show that these can lead to
a significant increase in the prediction accuracy of a binary classifier on
this task. We further validate this by conducting thorough experimental
analyses under different set-ups on two publicly available datasets.

					<dc:title>Universal 1-loop divergences for integrable sigma models</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Levine, Nat</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We present a simple, new method for the 1-loop renormalization of integrable
$\sigma$-models. By treating equations of motion and Bianchi identities on an
equal footing, we derive 'universal' formulae for the 1-loop on-shell
divergences, generalizing case-by-case computations in the literature. Given a
choice of poles for the classical Lax connection, the divergences take a
theory-independent form in terms of the Lax currents (the residues of the
poles), assuming a 'completeness' condition on the zero-curvature equations. We
compute these divergences for a large class of theories with simple poles in
the Lax connection. We also show that $Z_T$ coset models of 'pure-spinor' type
and their recently constructed $\eta$- and $\lambda$-deformations are 1-loop
renormalizable, and 1-loop scale-invariant when the Killing form vanishes.

					<dc:description>  Chip-based optical amplifiers can significantly expand the functionalities of
photonic devices. In particular, optical-parametric amplifiers (OPAs), with
engineerable gain-spectra, are well-suited for nonlinear-photonic applications.
Chip-based OPAs typically require long waveguides that occupy a large
footprint, and high pump powers that cannot be easily produced with chip-scale
lasers. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a
microresonator-assisted regenerative OPA that benefits from the large
nonlinearity enhancement of microresonators and yields a high gain in a small
footprint. We achieve 30-dB parametric gain with only 9 mW of cw-pump power and
show that the gain spectrum can be engineered to cover telecom channels
inaccessible with Er-based amplifiers. We further demonstrate the amplification
of Kerr-soliton comb lines and the preservation of their phase properties.
Additionally, we demonstrate amplification by injection locking of
optical-parametric oscillators, which corresponds to a regenerative amplifier
pumped above the oscillation threshold. Novel dispersion engineering techniques
such as coupled cavities and higher-order-dispersion phase matching can further
extend the tunability and spectral coverage of our amplification schemes. The
combination of high gain, small footprint, low pump power, and flexible
gain-spectra engineering of our regenerative OPA is ideal for amplifying
signals from the nanowatt to microwatt regimes for portable or space-based
devices where ultralow electrical power levels are required and can lead to
important applications in on-chip optical- and microwave-frequency synthesis
and precise timekeeping.

					<dc:description>  The Mn3X family of compounds was the first in which a large anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) was predicted to arise from a purely antiferromagnetic structure,
due to the Berry curvature in momentum space. Nearly simultaneously with this
prediction, a large AHE was observed experimentally in one of the hexagonal
members of this family, Mn3Sn. Aligning antiferromagnetic domains, a necessary
step for observation of the AHE, is more challenging for the cubic members of
the Mn3X family, due to a combination of a smaller spontaneous ferromagnetic
moment and much stronger magnetic anisotropy. Here, we use a combination of
uniaxial stress and applied magnetic field to align domains of bulk
single-crystal Mn3Pt, and demonstrate for the first time a substantial AHE in a
bulk sample of a cubic member of the Mn3X family. The AHE remains locked in
with essentially no quantitative variation when the stress is ramped back to
zero, which shows that it is not a consequence of any stress-induced
ferromagnetic moment.

					<dc:description>  The formation and evolution of galaxies have proved sensitive to the
inclusion of stellar feedback, which is therefore crucial to any successful
galaxy model. We present INFERNO, a new model for hydrodynamic simulations of
galaxies, which incorporates resolved stellar objects with star-by-star
calculations of when and where the injection of enriched material, momentum,
and energy takes place. INFERNO treats early stellar kinematics to include
phenomena such as walkaway and runaway stars. We employ this innovative model
on simulations of a dwarf galaxy and demonstrate that our physically motivated
stellar feedback model can drive vigorous galactic winds. This is quantified by
mass and metal loading factors in the range of $10-100$, and an energy loading
factor close to unity. Outflows are established close to the disc, are highly
multi-phase, spanning almost $8$ orders of magnitude in temperature, and with a
clear dichotomy between mass ejected in cold, slow-moving
($T\lesssim5\times10^4\,{\rm K}$, $v&lt;100\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) gas and energy
ejected in hot, fast-moving ($T&gt;10^6\,{\rm K}$, $v&gt;100\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) gas.
In contrast to massive disc galaxies, we find a surprisingly weak impact of the
early stellar kinematics, with runaway stars having little to no effect on our
results, despite exploding in diffuse gas outside the dense star-forming gas,
as well as outside the galactic disc entirely. We demonstrate that this weak
impact in dwarf galaxies stems from a combination of strong feedback and a
porous interstellar medium, which obscure any unique signatures that runaway
stars provide.

					<dc:description>  This paper addresses a new semantic multi-robot planning problem in uncertain
and dynamic environments. Particularly, the environment is occupied with
non-cooperative, mobile, uncertain labeled targets. These targets are governed
by stochastic dynamics while their current and future positions as well as
their semantic labels are uncertain. Our goal is to control mobile sensing
robots so that they can accomplish collaborative semantic tasks defined over
the uncertain current/future positions and labels of these targets. We express
these tasks using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We propose a sampling-based
approach that explores the robot motion space, the mission specification space,
as well as the future configurations of the labeled targets to design optimal
paths. These paths are revised online to adapt to uncertain perceptual
feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses
semantic mission planning problems in uncertain and dynamic semantic
environments. We provide extensive experiments that demonstrate the efficiency
of the proposed method

					<dc:description>  A classical wave-particle entity (WPE) can be realized experimentally as a
droplet walking on the free surface of a vertically vibrating liquid bath, with
the droplet's horizontal walking motion guided by its self-generated wave
field. These self-propelled WPEs have been shown to exhibit analogs of several
quantum and optical phenomena. Using an idealized theoretical model that takes
the form of a Lorenz-like system, we theoretically and numerically explore the
dynamics of such a one-dimensional WPE in a sinusoidal potential. We find
steady states of the system that correspond to a stationary WPE as well as a
rich array of unsteady motions such as back-and-forth oscillating walkers,
runaway oscillating walkers and various types of irregular walkers. In the
parameter space formed by the dimensionless parameters of the applied
sinusoidal potential, we observe patterns of alternating unsteady behaviors
suggesting interference effects. Additionally, in certain regions of the
parameter space, we also identify multistability in the particle's long-term
behavior that depends on the initial conditions. We make analogies between the
identified behaviors in the WPE system and Bragg's reflection of light as well
as electron motion in crystals.

					<dc:description>  While general relativity predicts only two tensor modes for gravitational
wave polarization, general metric theories of gravity allows up to four
additional modes, including two vector and two scalar modes. Observing the
polarization modes of gravitational waves could provide a direct test of the
modified gravity. The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which
may be detected by space-based laser-interferometric detectors at design
sensitivity, will provide an opportunity to directly measure alternative
polarization. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the LISA-TianQin
network for detecting alternative polarizations of stochastic backgrounds, and
propose a method to separate different polarization modes. First, we generalize
the small antenna approximation to compute the overlap reduction functions for
SGWB with arbitrary polarization, which is suitable for any time-delay
interferometry combination. Then we analyze the detection capability of
LISA-TianQin for SGWB with different polarizations. Based on the LISA-TianQin
orbital characteristics, we propose a method to distinguish different
polarization modes from their mixed data. Compared with ground-based detectors,
the LISA-TianQin network is more capable of resolving polarizations of SGWB. In
particular, the LISA-TianQin network has the potential to resolve two scalar
modes that ground-based detectors cannot.

					<dc:description>  The pair correlations of the Thue--Morse sequence and system are revisited,
with focus on asymptotic results on various means. First, it is shown that all
higher-order correlations of the Thue--Morse sequence with general real weights
are effectively determined by a single value of the balanced $2$-point
correlation. As a consequence, we show that all odd-order correlations of the
balanced Thue--Morse sequence vanish, and that, for any even $n$, the $n$-point
correlations of the balanced Thue--Morse sequence have mean value zero, as do
their absolute values, raised to an arbitrary positive power. All these results
also apply to the entire Thue--Morse system. We finish by showing how the
correlations of the Thue--Morse system with general real weights can be derived
from the balanced $2$-point correlations.

					<dc:title>Firewall black holes and echoes from an action principle</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Abedi, Jahed</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It is often said that there is no gravity theory based on local action
principles giving rise to firewall black hole solutions. Additionally, Guo and
Mathur 2022 (2205.10921) have cast doubt on the observability of firewall
echoes due to closed trapped surface produced by backreaction of macroscopic
in-falling wave packets. In this paper, we bring Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
action as a toy model that serves as counterexample to these assertions.
Actions with Maxwell and dilaton fields emerge from several fundamental
theories, such as the low energy limit of (super) string theory or Kaluza-Klein
compactifications. In these systems, the black hole solution has two curvature
singularities. We will show that the outer singularity inside the event horizon
can cause significant change to the outside, close to the extremal limit,
making a macroscopic reflective barrier near the event horizon that would lead
to &quot;observable&quot; gravitational wave echoes in this toy model. Additionally, we
also call into question the argument by Guo et al. 2017 (1711.01617) claiming
that a very small fraction of the backscattered photons will be able to escape
back to infinity from the firewall using these black holes as counterexample.

					<dc:description>  In offline model-based optimization, we strive to maximize a black-box
objective function by only leveraging a static dataset of designs and their
scores. This problem setting arises in numerous fields including the design of
materials, robots, DNA sequences, and proteins. Recent approaches train a deep
neural network (DNN) on the static dataset to act as a proxy function, and then
perform gradient ascent on the existing designs to obtain potentially
high-scoring designs. This methodology frequently suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor
designs. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for
offline Infinite-width model-based optimization (BDI). BDI consists of two
mappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the
scores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the
high-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward
mapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the
static dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the
out-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of
the backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which
leads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an
infinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural
tangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates.
Experiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of BDI. The code is
available at https://github.com/GGchen1997/BDI.

					<dc:description>  Deep learning algorithms for predicting neuroimaging data have shown
considerable promise in various applications. Prior work has demonstrated that
deep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can
outperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most
prior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults.
Within the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large
longitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict
gender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results
demonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (&gt;97%) with
training epochs &gt;200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions
identified as the most discriminative in the task under study include
predominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender
predictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of
visual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust
gender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range.
This suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during
adolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral
and environmental factors.

					<dc:description>  Multimodal demonstrations provide robots with an abundance of information to
make sense of the world. However, such abundance may not always lead to good
performance when it comes to learning sensorimotor control policies from human
demonstrations. Extraneous data modalities can lead to state
over-specification, where the state contains modalities that are not only
useless for decision-making but also can change data distribution across
environments. State over-specification leads to issues such as the learned
policy not generalizing outside of the training data distribution. In this
work, we propose Masked Imitation Learning (MIL) to address state
over-specification by selectively using informative modalities. Specifically,
we design a masked policy network with a binary mask to block certain
modalities. We develop a bi-level optimization algorithm that learns this mask
to accurately filter over-specified modalities. We demonstrate empirically that
MIL outperforms baseline algorithms in simulated domains including MuJoCo and a
robot arm environment using the Robomimic dataset, and effectively recovers the
environment-invariant modalities on a multimodal dataset collected on a real
robot. Our project website presents supplemental details and videos of our
results at: https://tinyurl.com/masked-il

demonstrating their nonabelian exchange properties. Here, we present a
low-energy model describing localized edge states in a two-arm device. We study
parity-to-charge conversion based on coupling the superconductor bound states
to a quantum dot whose charge is read out by a sensor. The dynamics of the
system, including the readout device, is analyzed in full using a quantum-jump
approach. We show how the resulting signal and noise ratio differentiates

above, we devise a two-stage Transformer-based framework that Composes a lead
sheet first, and then Embellishes it with accompaniment and expressive touches.
Such a factorization also enables pretraining on non-piano data. Our objective
and subjective experiments show that Compose &amp; Embellish shrinks the gap in
structureness between a current state of the art and real performances by half,
and improves other musical aspects such as richness and coherence as well.

					<dc:description>  A $k$-bend path is a non-self-intersecting polyline in the plane made of at
most $k+1$ axis-parallel line segments. B$_k$-VPG is the class of graphs which
can be represented as intersection graphs of $k$-bend paths in the same plane.
In this paper, we show that all AT-free outerplanar graphs are B$_0$-VPG, i.e.,
intersection graphs of horizontal and vertical line segments in the plane. Our
proofs are constructive and give a polynomial time B$_0$-VPG drawing algorithm
for the class.
  Following a long line of improvements, Gon\c{c}alves, Isenmann, and Pennarun
[SODA 2018] showed that all planar graphs are B$_1$-VPG. Since there are planar
graphs which are not B$_0$-VPG, characterizing B$_0$-VPG graphs among planar
graphs becomes interesting. Chaplick et al.\ [WG 2012] had shown that it is
NP-complete to recognize B$_k$-VPG graphs within B$_{k+1}$-VPG. Hence
recognizing B$_0$-VPG graphs within B$_1$-VPG is NP-complete in general, but
the question is open when restricted to planar graphs. There are outerplanar
graphs and AT-free planar graphs which are not B$_0$-VPG. This piqued our
interest in AT-free outerplanar graphs.

					<dc:description>  The factor graph decentralized data fusion (FG-DDF) framework was developed
for analysis and exploitation of conditional independence in heterogeneous
Bayesian decentralized fusion problems, in which robots update and fuse pdfs
over different, but overlapping subsets of random states. This allows robots to
efficiently use smaller probabilistic models and sparse message passing to
accurately and scalably fuse relevant local parts of a larger global joint
state pdf while accounting for data dependencies between robots. Whereas prior
work required limiting assumptions about network connectivity and model
linearity, this paper relaxes these to explore the applicability and robustness
of FG-DDF in more general settings. We develop a new heterogeneous fusion rule
which generalizes the homogeneous covariance intersection algorithm for such
cases and test it in multi-robot tracking and localization scenarios with
non-linear motion/observation models under communication dropouts. Simulation
and hardware experiments show that, in practice, the FG-DDF continues to
provide consistent filtered estimates under these more practical operating
conditions, while reducing computation and communication costs by more than
95%, thus enabling the design of scalable real-world multi-robot systems.

					<dc:description>  Obstacle detection is a safety-critical problem in robot navigation, where
stereo matching is a popular vision-based approach. While deep neural networks
have shown impressive results in computer vision, most of the previous obstacle
detection works only leverage traditional stereo matching techniques to meet
the computational constraints for real-time feedback. This paper proposes a
computationally efficient method that employs a deep neural network to detect
occupancy from stereo images directly. Instead of learning the point cloud
correspondence from the stereo data, our approach extracts the compact obstacle
distribution based on volumetric representations. In addition, we prune the
computation of safety irrelevant spaces in a coarse-to-fine manner based on
octrees generated by the decoder. As a result, we achieve real-time performance
on the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson TX2). Our approach detects obstacles
accurately in the range of 32 meters and achieves better IoU (Intersection over
Union) and CD (Chamfer Distance) scores with only 2% of the computation cost of
the state-of-the-art stereo model. Furthermore, we validate our method's
robustness and real-world feasibility through autonomous navigation experiments
with a real robot. Hence, our work contributes toward closing the gap between
the stereo-based system in robot perception and state-of-the-art stereo models
in computer vision. To counter the scarcity of high-quality real-world indoor
stereo datasets, we collect a 1.36 hours stereo dataset with a mobile robot
which is used to fine-tune our model. The dataset, the code, and further
details including additional visualizations are available at

					<dc:description>  While reinforcement learning (RL) methods that learn an internal model of the
environment have the potential to be more sample efficient than their
model-free counterparts, learning to model raw observations from high
dimensional sensors can be challenging. Prior work has addressed this challenge
by learning low-dimensional representation of observations through auxiliary
objectives, such as reconstruction or value prediction. However, the alignment
between these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In
this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space
model and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This
objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for
model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly
on the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm
matches or improves the sample-efficiency of the best prior model-based and
model-free RL methods. While sample efficient methods typically are
computationally demanding, our method attains the performance of SAC in about
50% less wall-clock time.

					<dc:title>A Non-parametric Skill Representation with Soft Null Space Projectors

					<dc:description>  Over the last two decades, the robotics community witnessed the emergence of
various motion representations that have been used extensively, particularly in
behavorial cloning, to compactly encode and generalize skills. Among these,
probabilistic approaches have earned a relevant place, owing to their encoding
of variations, correlations and adaptability to new task conditions. Modulating
such primitives, however, is often cumbersome due to the need for parameter
re-optimization which frequently entails computationally costly operations. In
this paper we derive a non-parametric movement primitive formulation that
contains a null space projector. We show that such formulation allows for fast
and efficient motion generation with computational complexity O(n2) without
involving matrix inversions, whose complexity is O(n3). This is achieved by
using the null space to track secondary targets, with a precision determined by
the training dataset. Using a 2D example associated with time input we show
that our non-parametric solution compares favourably with a state-of-the-art
parametric approach. For demonstrated skills with high-dimensional inputs we
show that it permits on-the-fly adaptation as well.

					<dc:description>  Popular Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) entrust centralized infrastructure
providers (e.g., Infura) to run the consensus client logic on their behalf. As
a result, these wallets are light-weight and high-performant, but come with
security risks. A malicious provider can mislead the wallet, e.g., fake
payments and balances, or censor transactions. On the other hand, light
clients, which are not in popular use today, allow decentralization, but at
concretely inefficient and asymptotically linear bootstrapping complexity. This
poses a dilemma between decentralization and performance. In this paper, we
design, implement, and evaluate a new proof-of-stake (PoS) superlight client
with concretely efficient and asymptotically logarithmic bootstrapping
complexity. Our proofs of proof-of-stake (PoPoS) take the form of a Merkle tree
of PoS epochs. The verifier enrolls the provers in a bisection game, in which
the honest prover is destined to win once an adversarial Merkle tree is
challenged at sufficient depth. To evaluate our superlight protocol, we provide
a client implementation that is compatible with mainnet PoS Ethereum: compared
to the state-of-the-art light client construction of PoS Ethereum, our client
improves time-to-completion by 9x, communication by 180x, and energy usage by
30x (when bootstrapping after 10 years of consensus execution). We prove that
our construction is secure and show how to employ it for other PoS systems such
as Cardano (with full adaptivity), Algorand, and Snow White.

					<dc:description>  Spiking neural networks have significant potential utility in robotics due to
their high energy efficiency on specialized hardware, but proof-of-concept
implementations have not yet typically achieved competitive performance or
capability with conventional approaches. In this paper, we tackle one of the
key practical challenges of scalability by introducing a novel modular ensemble
network approach, where compact, localized spiking networks each learn and are
solely responsible for recognizing places in a local region of the environment
only. This modular approach creates a highly scalable system. However, it comes
with a high-performance cost where a lack of global regularization at
deployment time leads to hyperactive neurons that erroneously respond to places
outside their learned region. Our second contribution introduces a
regularization approach that detects and removes these problematic hyperactive
neurons during the initial environmental learning phase. We evaluate this new
scalable modular system on benchmark localization datasets Nordland and Oxford
RobotCar, with comparisons to standard techniques NetVLAD, DenseVLAD, and SAD,
and a previous spiking neural network system. Our system substantially
outperforms the previous SNN system on its small dataset, but also maintains
performance on 27 times larger benchmark datasets where the operation of the
previous system is computationally infeasible, and performs competitively with
the conventional localization systems.

					<dc:description>  When solid-state redox-driven phase transformations are associated with mass
loss, vacancies are produced that develop into pores. These pores can influence
the kinetics of certain redox and phase transformation steps. We investigated
the structural and chemical mechanisms in and at pores in a combined
experimental-theoretical study, using the reduction of iron oxide by hydrogen
as a model system. The redox product (water) accumulates inside the pores and
shifts the local equilibrium at the already reduced material back towards
re-oxidation into cubic-Fe1-xO (where x refers to Fe deficiency, space group
Fm3-m). This effect helps to understand the sluggish reduction of cubic-Fe1-xO
by hydrogen, a key process for future sustainable steelmaking.

					<dc:description>  Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer the knowledge of common
classes from source domain to target domain without any prior knowledge on the
label set, which requires to distinguish the unknown samples from the known
ones in the target domain. A main challenge of UniDA is that the unequal label
spaces of both domains causes the misalignment between two domains.To address
the above challenging problems, we propose a new uncertainty-guided UniDA
framework. Firstly, we introduce an empirical estimation of the probability of
a target sample belonging to the unknown class with exploiting the distribution
of target samples. Then, based on the estimation, we propose a novel neighbors
searching method in the linear subspace with a $\delta$-filter to estimate the
uncertainty score of a target sample and discover unknown samples. It fully
utilizes the relationship between a target sample and its neighbors in source
domain to avoid the influence of domain misalignment. Secondly, this paper well
balances the confidence of predictions for both known and unknown samples
through an uncertainty-guided margin loss based on the predictions of
discovered unknown samples, which can reduce the gap between intra-class
variance of known classes with respect to the unknown class. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly

					<dc:description>  This paper explores the difficulties in solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs use
physics as a regularization term in the objective function. However, a drawback
of this approach is the requirement for manual hyperparameter tuning, making it
impractical in the absence of validation data or prior knowledge of the
solution. Our investigations of the loss landscapes and backpropagated
gradients in the presence of physics reveal that existing methods produce
non-convex loss landscapes that are hard to navigate. Our findings demonstrate
that high-order PDEs contaminate backpropagated gradients and hinder
convergence. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method that
bypasses the calculation of high-order derivative operators and mitigates the
contamination of backpropagated gradients. Consequently, we reduce the
dimension of the search space and make learning PDEs with non-smooth solutions
feasible. Our method also provides a mechanism to focus on complex regions of
the domain. Besides, we present a dual unconstrained formulation based on
Lagrange multiplier method to enforce equality constraints on the model's
prediction, with adaptive and independent learning rates inspired by adaptive
subgradient methods. We apply our approach to solve various linear and
non-linear PDEs.

					<dc:description>  The ability of overparameterized deep networks to interpolate noisy data,
while at the same time showing good generalization performance, has been
recently characterized in terms of the double descent curve for the test error.
Common intuition from polynomial regression suggests that overparameterized
networks are able to sharply interpolate noisy data, without considerably
deviating from the ground-truth signal, thus preserving their generalization
ability. At present, a precise characterization of the relationship between
interpolation and generalization for deep networks is missing. In this work, we
quantify sharpness of fit of the training data interpolated by neural network
functions, by studying the loss landscape w.r.t.\ to the input variable locally
to each training point, over volumes around cleanly- and noisily-labelled
training samples, as we systematically increase the number of model parameters
and training epochs. Our findings show that loss sharpness in the input space
follows both model- and epoch-wise double descent, with worse peaks observed
around noisy labels. While small interpolating models sharply fit both clean
and noisy data, large interpolating models express a smooth loss landscape,
where noisy targets are predicted over large volumes around training data
points, in contrast to existing intuition.

					<dc:description>  Collaborative robots stand to have an immense impact on both human welfare in
domestic service applications and industrial superiority in advanced
manufacturing with dexterous assembly. The outstanding challenge is providing
robotic fingertips with a physical design that makes them adept at performing
dexterous tasks that require high-resolution, calibrated shape reconstruction
and force sensing. In this work, we present DenseTact 2.0, an optical-tactile
sensor capable of visualizing the deformed surface of a soft fingertip and
using that image in a neural network to perform both calibrated shape
reconstruction and 6-axis wrench estimation. We demonstrate the sensor accuracy
of 0.3633mm per pixel for shape reconstruction, 0.410N for forces, 0.387Nmm for
torques, and the ability to calibrate new fingers through transfer learning,
which achieves comparable performance with only 12% of the non-transfer
learning dataset size.

					<dc:description>  When two parties, Alice and Bob, share correlated quantum systems and Alice
performs local measurements, Alice's updated description of Bob's state can
provide evidence of nonclassical correlations. This simple scenario, famously
introduced by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR), can be modified by allowing
Bob to also have a classical or quantum system as an input. In this case, Alice
updates her knowledge of the channel (rather than of a state) in Bob's lab. In
this paper, we provide a unified framework for studying the nonclassicality of
various such generalizations of the EPR scenario. We do so using a resource
theory wherein the free operations are local operations and shared randomness
(LOSR). We derive a semidefinite program for studying the pre-order of EPR
resources and discover possible conversions between the latter. Moreover, we
study conversions between post-quantum resources both analytically and
numerically.

					<dc:description>  We show that the analytic structure of the dynamical xc kernels of
semiconductors and insulators can be sensed in terms of its poles which mark
physically relevant frequencies of the system where the counter-phase motion of
discrete collective excitations occurs: if excited, the collective modes
counterbalance each other, making the system to exhibit none at all or
extremely weak density response. This property can be employed to construct
simple and practically relevant approximations of the dynamical xc kernel for
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Such kernels have simple
analytic structure, are able to reproduce dominant excitonic features of the
absorption spectra of monolayer semiconductors and bulk solids, and promise
high potential for future uses in efficient real-time calculations with TDDFT.

					<dc:description>  State-of-the-art object detectors are commonly evaluated based on accuracy
metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP). In this paper, inspired by the
fact that mAP is not a direct safety indicator, we propose a straightforward
safety metric, especially for 3D object detectors in Autonomous Driving
contexts, by combining the Intersection-over-Ground-Truth (IoGT) measure and a
distance ratio. Subsequently, we formulate a safety-aware loss function by
amending IoGT to commonly used accuracy-oriented loss functions. Our
experiments using models from the MMDetection3D library, the nuScenes dataset,
and an in-house simulation dataset demonstrate that the object detector trained
with our loss function significantly reduces unsafe predictions while staying
performant on accuracy and maintaining good stability in the learning process.

					<dc:description>  The rate of particle creation in a resonantly oscillating cavity is known to
be approximately constant at large evolution times. Employing the
Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, we show that nonlinear interactions
generate nonzero quantum averages and significantly enhance this rate. To
illustrate this phenomenon, we consider a massless scalar field with a quartic
interaction in a one-dimensional cavity with perfectly reflecting walls
oscillating at twice the fundamental frequency.

					<dc:description>  Barkhausen noise in disordered ferromagnets is typically understood to
originate primarily from jerky field-driven motion of domain walls. We study
the magnetization reversal process in disordered permalloy thin films using
micromagnetic simulations, and find that the magnetization reversal process
consists of gradual formation of immobile 360$^{\circ}$ domain walls via a
sequence of localized magnetization rotation events. The density of
360$^{\circ}$ domain walls formed within the sample as well as the statistical
properties of the Barkhausen jumps are controlled by the disorder strength.

					<dc:description>  The performance of local feature descriptors degrades in the presence of
large rotation variations. To address this issue, we present an efficient
approach to learning rotation invariant descriptors. Specifically, we propose
Rotated Kernel Fusion (RKF) which imposes rotations on each convolution kernel
and improves the inherent nature of CNN. Since RKF can be processed by the
subsequent re-parameterization, no extra computational costs will be introduced
in the inference stage. Moreover, we present Multi-oriented Feature Aggregation
(MOFA) which ensembles features extracted from multiple rotated versions of
input images and can provide auxiliary information for the training of RKF by
leveraging the knowledge distillation strategy. We refer to the distilled RKF
model as DRKF. Besides the evaluation on a rotation-augmented version of the
public dataset HPatches, we also contribute a new dataset named DiverseBEV
which consists of bird's eye view images with large viewpoint changes and
camera rotations. Extensive experiments show that our method can outperform
other state-of-the-art techniques when exposed to large rotation variations.

and the PFH spectral invariants by using closed-open morphisms and open-closed

by prefixing a 0-bit to each Dyck word of length $2k$ and used to reinterpret
the Hamilton cycles in the odd graph $O_k$ and the middle-levels graph $M_k$
found by M\&quot;utze et al.) represent in $O_k$ (resp., $M_k$) the cycles of an
$n$- (resp., $2n$-) 2-factor and its cyclic (resp., dihedral) vertex classes,
and are equivalent to Dyck-nest signatures. A sequence is obtained by updating
these signatures according to the depth-first order of a tree of restricted
growth strings (RGS's), reducing the RGS-generation of Dyck words by collapsing
to a single update the time-consuming $i$-nested castling used to reach each
non-root Dyck word or Dyck nest. This update is universal, for it does not
depend on $k$.

					<dc:description>  Using a sample of $(10.09\pm0.04)\times10^{9}$ $J/\psi$ decays collected with
the BESIII detector, partial wave analyses of the decay $J/\psi\to\gamma
K^{0}_{S} K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ are performed within the
$K^{0}_{S}K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass region below $1.6\mathrm{\ Ge\kern
-0.1em V}/c^2$. The covariant tensor amplitude method is used in both mass
independent and mass dependent approaches. Both analysis approaches exhibit
dominant pseudoscalar and axial vector components, and show good consistency
for the other individual components. Furthermore, the mass dependent analysis
reveals that the $K^{0}_{S}K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass spectrum for the
pseudoscalar component can be well described with two isoscalar resonant states
using relativistic Breit-Wigner model, ${\it i.e.}$, the $\eta(1405)$ with a
mass of $1391.7\pm0.7_{-0.3}^{+11.3}\mathrm{\ Me\kern -0.1em V}/c^2$ and a
width of $60.8\pm1.2_{-12.0}^{+5.5}\mathrm{\ Me\kern -0.1em V}$, and the
$\eta(1475)$ with a mass of $1507.6\pm1.6_{-32.2}^{+15.5}\mathrm{\ Me\kern
-0.1em V}/c^2$ and a width of $115.8\pm2.4_{-10.9}^{+14.8}\mathrm{\ Me\kern
-0.1em V}$. The first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic,
respectively. Alternate models for the pseudoscalar component are also tested,
but the description of the $K^{0}_{S}K^{0}_{S}\pi^{0}$ invariant mass spectrum
deteriorates significantly.

					<dc:description>  Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries, particularly for
older persons. Imbalance can result from the body's internal causes (illness),
or external causes (active or passive perturbation). Active perturbation
results from applying an external force to a person, while passive perturbation
results from human motion interacting with a static obstacle. This work
proposes a metric that allows for the monitoring of the person's torso and its
correlation to active and passive perturbations. We show that large changes in
the torso sway can be strongly correlated to active perturbations. We also show
that we can reasonably predict the future path and expected change in torso
sway by conditioning the expected path and torso sway on the past trajectory,
torso motion, and the surrounding scene. This could have direct future
applications to fall prevention. Results demonstrate that the torso sway is
strongly correlated with perturbations. And our model is able to make use of
the visual cues presented in the panorama and condition the prediction
accordingly.

					<dc:description>  Vision transformers (ViT) have shown promise in various vision tasks while
the U-Net based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) remains dominant in
diffusion models. We design a simple and general ViT-based architecture (named
U-ViT) for image generation with diffusion models. U-ViT is characterized by
treating all inputs including the time, condition and noisy image patches as
tokens and employing long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. We
evaluate U-ViT in unconditional and class-conditional image generation, as well
as text-to-image generation tasks, where U-ViT is comparable if not superior to
a CNN-based U-Net of a similar size. In particular, latent diffusion models
with U-ViT achieve record-breaking FID scores of 2.29 in class-conditional
image generation on ImageNet 256x256, and 5.48 in text-to-image generation on
MS-COCO, among methods without accessing large external datasets during the
training of generative models. Our results suggest that, for diffusion-based
image modeling, the long skip connection is crucial while the down-sampling and
up-sampling operators in CNN-based U-Net are not always necessary. We believe
that U-ViT can provide insights for future research on backbones in diffusion
models and benefit generative modeling on large scale cross-modality datasets.

					<dc:description>  We are investigating the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equation, and we
find previously unknown anomalous terms in Hamiltonian, Dissipation, and
Helicity, which survive this limit and define the turbulent statistics.
  We find various topologically nontrivial configurations of the confined
Clebsch field responsible for vortex sheets and lines. In particular, a stable
vortex sheet family is discovered, but its anomalous dissipation vanishes as
$\sqrt{\nu}$.
  Topologically stable stationary singular flows, which we call Kelvinons, are
introduced. They have a conserved velocity circulation $\Gamma_\alpha$ around
the loop $C$ and another one $\Gamma_\beta$ for an infinitesimal closed loop
$\tilde C$ encircling $C$, leading to a finite helicity. The anomalous
dissipation has a finite limit, which we computed analytically.
  The Kelvinon is responsible for asymptotic PDF tails of velocity circulation,
\textbf{perfectly matching numerical simulations}.
  The loop equation for circulation PDF as functional of the loop shape is
derived and studied. This equation is \textbf{exactly} equivalent to the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation in loop space, with viscosity $\nu$ playing the role of
Planck's constant.
  Kelvinons are fixed points of the loop equation at WKB limit $\nu \rightarrow
0$. The anomalous Hamiltonian for the Kelvinons contains a large parameter
$\log \frac{|\Gamma_\beta|}{\nu}$. The leading powers of this parameter can be
summed up, leading to familiar asymptotic freedom, like in QCD. In particular,
the so-called multifractal scaling laws are, as in QCD, modified by the powers
of the logarithm.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we propose closed-form analytical expressions to determine the
minimum number of driver nodes that is needed to control a specific class of
networks. We consider swarm signaling networks with regular out-degree
distribution where a fraction $p$ of the links is unavailable. We further apply
our method to networks with bi-modal out-degree distributions. Our
approximations are validated through intensive simulations. Results show that
our approximations have high accuracy when compared with simulation results for
both types of out-degree distribution.

					<dc:description>  Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) represent a gold standard when developing
policy guidelines. However, RCTs are often narrow, and lack data on broader
populations of interest. Causal effects in these populations are often
estimated using observational datasets, which may suffer from unobserved
confounding and selection bias. Given a set of observational estimates (e.g.
from multiple studies), we propose a meta-algorithm that attempts to reject
observational estimates that are biased. We do so using validation effects,
causal effects that can be inferred from both RCT and observational data. After
rejecting estimators that do not pass this test, we generate conservative
confidence intervals on the extrapolated causal effects for subgroups not
observed in the RCT. Under the assumption that at least one observational
estimator is asymptotically normal and consistent for both the validation and
extrapolated effects, we provide guarantees on the coverage probability of the
intervals output by our algorithm. To facilitate hypothesis testing in settings
where causal effect transportation across datasets is necessary, we give
conditions under which a doubly-robust estimator of group average treatment
effects is asymptotically normal, even when flexible machine learning methods
are used for estimation of nuisance parameters. We illustrate the properties of
our approach on semi-synthetic and real world datasets, and show that it
compares favorably to standard meta-analysis techniques.

					<dc:description>  Seamlessly integrating rules in Learning-from-Demonstrations (LfD) policies
is a critical requirement to enable the real-world deployment of AI agents.
Recently, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has been shown to be an effective
language for encoding rules as spatio-temporal constraints. This work uses
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a means of integrating STL specification into
a vanilla LfD policy to improve constraint satisfaction. We propose augmenting
the MCTS heuristic with STL robustness values to bias the tree search towards
branches with higher constraint satisfaction. While the domain-independent
method can be applied to integrate STL rules online into any pre-trained LfD
algorithm, we choose goal-conditioned Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
as the offline LfD policy. We apply the proposed method to the domain of
planning trajectories for General Aviation aircraft around a non-towered
airfield. Results using the simulator trained on real-world data showcase 60%
improved performance over baseline LfD methods that do not use STL heuristics.

					<dc:description>  Searching in a denied environment is challenging for swarm robots as no
assistance from GNSS, mapping, data sharing, and central processing is allowed.
However, using olfactory and auditory signals to cooperate like animals could
be an important way to improve the collaboration of swarm robots. In this
paper, an Olfactory-Auditory augmented Bug algorithm (OA-Bug) is proposed for a
swarm of autonomous robots to explore a denied environment. A simulation
environment is built to measure the performance of OA-Bug. The coverage of the
search task using OA-Bug can reach 96.93%, with the most significant
improvement of 40.55% compared with a similar algorithm, SGBA. Furthermore,
experiments are conducted on real swarm robots to prove the validity of OA-Bug.
Results show that OA-Bug can improve the performance of swarm robots in a
denied environment.

					<dc:description>  Resonances are sensitive to the properties of the medium created in heavy ion
collision. They also provide insight into the properties of the hadronic phase.
Studying the dependence of the yield of resonances on transverse spherocity and
multiplicity allows us to understand the resonance production mechanism with
event topology and system size, respectively. The results reported pertains to
{\Lambda}(1520) . The data from EPOS3 is used for the present analysis.

					<dc:description>  A Transformer-based deep direct sampling method is proposed for electrical
impedance tomography, a well-known severely ill-posed nonlinear boundary value
inverse problem. A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the
learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed
images. An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question:
whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a
mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep
neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse
problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a
partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions
as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels,
the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method
achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator
learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. This research shall
strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language
processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be
modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which
ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.

					<dc:description>  We tackle the problem of generating audio samples conditioned on descriptive
text captions. In this work, we propose AaudioGen, an auto-regressive
generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs.
AudioGen operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of
text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio
travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task
(e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further
complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise,
reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint,
limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio
requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long
sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an
augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to
internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets
containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity
of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of
multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining
a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. We apply classifier-free guidance to
improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen
outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. Finally, we explore the
ability of the proposed method to generate audio continuation conditionally and
unconditionally. Samples: https://felixkreuk.github.io/audiogen

					<dc:title>Gaussian Processes for Glitch-robust Gravitational-wave Astronomy</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Ashton, Gregory</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Interferometric gravitational-wave observatories have opened a new era in
astronomy. The rich data produced by an international network enables detailed
analysis of the curved space-time around black holes. With nearly one hundred
signals observed so far and thousands expected in the next decade, their
population properties enable insights into stellar evolution and the expansion
of our Universe. However, the detectors are afflicted by transient noise
artefacts known as &quot;glitches&quot; which contaminate the signals and bias
inferences. Of the 90 signals detected to date, 18 were contaminated by
glitches. This feasibility study explores a new approach to transient
gravitational-wave data analysis using Gaussian processes, which model the
underlying physics of the glitch-generating mechanism rather than the explicit
realisation of the glitch itself. We demonstrate that if the Gaussian process
kernel function can adequately model the glitch morphology, we can recover the
parameters of simulated signals. Moreover, we find that the Gaussian processes
kernels used in this work are well-suited to modelling long-duration glitches
which are most challenging for existing glitch-mitigation approaches. Finally,
we show how the time-domain nature of our approach enables a new class of
time-domain tests of General Relativity, performing a re-analysis of the
inspiral-merger-ringdown test on the first observed binary black hole merger.
Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the Gaussian processes as an
alternative to the traditional framework but does not yet establish them as a
replacement. Therefore, we conclude with an outlook on the steps needed to
realise the full potential of the Gaussian process approach.

					<dc:description>  In legged logomotion, online trajectory optimization techniques generally
depend on heuristic-based contact planners in order to have low computation
times and achieve high replanning frequencies. In this work, we propose
ContactNet, a fast acyclic contact planner based on a multi-output regression
neural network. ContactNet ranks discretized stepping regions, allowing to
quickly choose the best feasible solution, even in complex environments. The
low computation time, in the order of 1 ms, makes possible the execution of the
contact planner concurrently with a trajectory optimizer in a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in
simulation in different complex scenarios with the quadruped robot Solo12.

					<dc:description>  Pair density wave states have been found on the surface of the Kagome
superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By treating the high-temperature charge orderings
as static backgrounds, we notice that all pair density waves reported have the
same wavevector in the low-temperature effective 2D Brillouin zone. On the
surface, they break the same symmetry. With this non-degenerate pair density
wave, we illustrate the resulting necessity for the possible vestigial
charge-4e phase to carry a non-zero center-of-mass momentum. We propose STM
experiments to distinguish various vestigial phases.

					<dc:title>Robust phase-controlled gates for scalable atomic quantum processors

					<dc:creator>Whitlock, Shannon</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Atomic Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A simple scheme is presented for realizing robust optically controlled
quantum gates for scalable atomic quantum processors by driving the qubits with
optical standing waves. Atoms localized close to the antinodes of the standing
wave can realize phase-controlled quantum operations that are potentially more
than an order of magnitude less sensitive to the local optical phase and atomic
motion than corresponding travelling wave configurations. The scheme is
compatible with robust optimal control techniques and spatial qubit addressing
in atomic arrays to realize phase controlled operations without the need for
tight focusing and precise positioning of the control lasers. This will be
particularly beneficial for quantum gates involving Doppler sensitive optical
frequency transitions and provides an all optical route to scaling up atomic
quantum processors.

					<dc:description>  The adoption of video conferencing and video communication services,
accelerated by COVID-19, has driven a rapid increase in video data traffic. The
demand for higher resolutions and quality, the need for immersive video
formats, and the newest, more complex video codecs increase the energy
consumption in data centers and display devices. In this paper, we explore and
compare the energy consumption across optimized state-of-the-art video codecs,
SVT-AV1, VVenC/VVdeC, VP9, and x.265. Furthermore, we align the energy usage
with various objective quality metrics and the compression performance for a
set of video sequences across different resolutions. The results indicate that
from the tested codecs and configurations, SVT-AV1 provides the best tradeoff
between energy consumption and quality. The reported results aim to serve as a
guide towards sustainable video streaming while not compromising the quality of
experience of the end user.

					<dc:description>  Generating dexterous grasping has been a long-standing and challenging
robotic task. Despite recent progress, existing methods primarily suffer from
two issues. First, most prior arts focus on a specific type of robot hand,
lacking the generalizable capability of handling unseen ones. Second, prior
arts oftentimes fail to rapidly generate diverse grasps with a high success
rate. To jointly tackle these challenges with a unified solution, we propose
GenDexGrasp, a novel hand-agnostic grasping algorithm for generalizable
grasping. GenDexGrasp is trained on our proposed large-scale multi-hand
grasping dataset MultiDex synthesized with force closure optimization. By
leveraging the contact map as a hand-agnostic intermediate representation,
GenDexGrasp efficiently generates diverse and plausible grasping poses with a
high success rate and can transfer among diverse multi-fingered robotic hands.
Compared with previous methods, GenDexGrasp achieves a three-way trade-off
among success rate, inference speed, and diversity. Code is available at
https://github.com/tengyu-liu/GenDexGrasp.

					<dc:description>  Quantum measurements are basic tools for extracting information from quantum
systems. The complete information content in a quantum system consists of
complementary elements that are inaccessible simultaneously, and each
measurement provides only a restricted view of it. We introduce the notion of
\emph{view operator} to characterize the combined view provided by a
measurement set, which not only allows one to (partly) reconstruct unknown
quantum systems directly from measurement outcomes, but also is a powerful tool
for demonstrating the complementarity principle.
  Specifically, inspired by the operational invariant information measure of
quantum systems proposed by Brukner and Zeilinger [Phy. Rev. Lett. {\bf83},
3354 (1999)], we derive a general exclusion relation depicting the tradeoff
between the information of quantum systems gainable in different measurements,
which is tight for arbitrary complete set of mutually unbiased measurements
(CMUMs). On the way, we also explore implications of the view operator for the
uncertainty principle. Notably, we obtain a conservation law of linear entropic
uncertainty for CMUMs as well as the first R\'{e}nyi entropic uncertainty

					<dc:description>  Mixed quantum-classical spin systems have been proposed in spin chain theory
and, more recently, in magnon spintronics. However, current models of
quantum-classical dynamics beyond mean-field approximations typically suffer
from long-standing consistency issues, and, in some cases, invalidate
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Here, we present a fully Hamiltonian theory
of quantum-classical spin dynamics that appears to be the first to ensure an
entire series of consistency properties, including positivity of both the
classical and the quantum density, so that Heisenberg's principle is satisfied
at all times. We show how this theory may connect to recent energy-balance
considerations in measurement theory and we present its Poisson bracket
structure explicitly. After focusing on the simpler case of a classical Bloch
vector interacting with a quantum spin observable, we illustrate the extension
of the model to systems with several spins, and restore the presence of orbital
degrees of freedom.

					<dc:title>Spectral stability of near-extremal spacetimes</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Yang, Huan</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Zhang, Jun</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It has been suggested that the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rotating
black holes is unstable against additional potential terms in the perturbation
equation, as the operator associated with the equation is non-self-adjoint. We
point out that a bi-linear form has been constructed previously to allow a
perturbation analysis of the spectrum, which was applied to study the
quasinormal modes of weakly charged Kerr-Newman black holes [Phys. Rev. D 91,
044025 (2015)]. The proposed spectral instability should be restated as
instability against potential terms that have infinitesimal ``energy&quot; norm that
is specifically defined by the type of inner products introduced by Jaramillo
et al. and preserving the physical meaning of energy. We argue that it is
necessary to address the stability of all previous mode analysis results to
reveal their susceptibility to energetically infinitesimal perturbations. In
particular, for near extremal Kerr spacetime, we show that the spectrum of
zero-damping modes, which have slow decay rates, is unstable (with order unity
fractional change in decay rates) with fine-tuned modification of the
potential. The decay rates are, however, always positive with energetically
infinitesimal perturbations. If finite potential modifications are allowed near
the black hole, it is possible to find superradiantly unstable modes, i.e., a
``black hole bomb&quot; without an explicit outer shell. For the zero-damping modes
in near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\&quot;{o}m-de Sitter black holes, which are
relevant for the breakdown of strong cosmic censorship, we find that the
corresponding spectrum is stable under energetically infinitesimal
perturbations.

					<dc:title>3/2 magic-angle quantization rule of flat bands in twisted bilayer
  graphene and relationship with the Quantum Hall effect</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Navarro-Labastida, Leonardo A.</dc:creator>

					<dc:description>  Flat band electronic modes in twisted graphene bilayers are responsible for
superconducting and other highly correlated electron-electron phases. Although
some hints were known of a possible connection between the quantum Hall effect
and zero flat band modes, it was not clear how such connection appears. Here
the electronic behavior in twisted bilayer graphene is studied using the chiral
model Hamiltonian. As a result, it is proved that for high-order magic angles,
the zero flat band modes converge into coherent Landau states with a dispersion
$\sigma^2=1/3\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a coupling parameter that incorporates
the twist angle and energetic scales. Then it is proved that the square of the
hamiltonian, which is a $2\times 2$ matrix operator, turns out to be equivalent
to a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The interlayer currents
between graphene's bipartite lattices are identified with the angular momentum
term while the confinement potential is an effective quadratic potential. From
there it is proved a limiting quantization rule for high-order magic angles,
i.e., $\alpha_{m+1}-\alpha_{m}=3/2$ where $m$ is the order of the angle. All
these results are in very good agreement with numerical calculations.

					<dc:description>  Point cloud registration is a crucial problem in computer vision and
robotics. Existing methods either rely on matching local geometric features,
which are sensitive to the pose differences, or leverage global shapes, which
leads to inconsistency when facing distribution variances such as partial
overlapping. Combining the advantages of both types of methods, we adopt a
coarse-to-fine pipeline that concurrently handles both issues. We first reduce
the pose differences between input point clouds by aligning global features;
then we match the local features to further refine the inaccurate alignments
resulting from distribution variances. As global feature alignment requires the
features to preserve the poses of input point clouds and local feature matching
expects the features to be invariant to these poses, we propose an
SE(3)-equivariant feature extractor to simultaneously generate two types of
features. In this feature extractor, representations that preserve the poses
are first encoded by our novel SE(3)-equivariant network and then converted
into pose-invariant ones by a pose-detaching module. Experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method increases the recall rate by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods when facing both pose differences and distribution
variances.

					<dc:description>  As a promising learning paradigm integrating computation and communication,
federated learning (FL) proceeds the local training and the periodic sharing
from distributed clients. Due to the non-i.i.d. data distribution on clients,
FL model suffers from the gradient diversity, poor performance, bad
convergence, etc. In this work, we aim to tackle this key issue by adopting
importance sampling (IS) for local training. We propose importance sampling
federated learning (ISFL), an explicit framework with theoretical guarantees.
Firstly, we derive the convergence theorem of ISFL to involve the effects of
local importance sampling. Then, we formulate the problem of selecting optimal
IS weights and obtain the theoretical solutions. We also employ a water-filling
method to calculate the IS weights and develop the ISFL algorithms. The
experimental results on CIFAR-10 fit the proposed theorems well and verify that
ISFL reaps better performance, sampling efficiency, as well as explainability
on non-i.i.d. data. To the best of our knowledge, ISFL is the first non-i.i.d.
FL solution from the local sampling aspect which exhibits theoretical
compatibility with neural network models. Furthermore, as a local sampling
approach, ISFL can be easily migrated into other emerging FL frameworks.

					<dc:description>  High-temperature cuprate superconductors-based van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles
hindering progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of
Josephson junctions (JJ) realized by the vdW devices. Here we report the new
method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+d,
crucially improving the JJ characteristics, pushing them up to those of the
intrinsic JJs in bulk samples. The method combines a cryogenic stacking using a
solvent-free stencil mask technique and covering interface by the insulating
hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high-vacuum condition down to
10-6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected
from water molecules during the in-situ metal deposition only when fully
encapsulated. Comparing the current-voltage curves of encapsulated and
unencapsulated interfaces, we reveal that the encapsulated interfaces'
characteristics are crucially improved so that the corresponding JJs
demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting
transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, we show that the
encapsulated heterostructures are more stable in time.

					<dc:description>  Perfect tensors describe highly entangled quantum states that have attracted
particular attention in the fields of quantum information theory and quantum
gravity. In loop quantum gravity, the natural question arises whether SU(2)
invariant tensors, which are fundamental ingredients of the basis states of
spacetime, can also be perfect. In this work, we present a number of general
constraints for the layout of such invariant perfect tensors (IPTs) and further
describe a systematic and constructive approach to check the existence of an
IPT of given valence. We apply our algorithm to show that no qubit encoding of
valence 6 can be described by an IPT and close a gap to prove a no-go theorem
for invariant perfect qubit encodings. We also provide two alternative proofs
for the non-existence of 4-valent qubit IPTs which has been shown in [1,2].

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study the broadband emission of Mrk 501 using multi-wavelength
observations from 2017 to 2020 performed with a multitude of instruments,
involving, among others, MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, GASP-WEBT, and OVRO.
Mrk 501 showed an extremely low broadband activity, which may help to unravel
its baseline emission. Nonetheless, significant flux variations are detected at
all wavebands, with the highest occurring at X-rays and very-high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-rays. A significant correlation ($&gt;$3$\sigma$) between X-rays and VHE
$\gamma$-rays is measured, supporting leptonic scenarios to explain the
variable parts of the emission, also during low activity. This is further
supported when we extend our data from 2008 to 2020, and identify, for the
first time, significant correlations between Swift-XRT and Fermi-LAT. We
additionally find correlations between high-energy $\gamma$-rays and radio,
with the radio lagging by more than 100 days, placing the $\gamma$-ray emission
zone upstream of the radio-bright regions in the jet. Furthermore, Mrk 501
showed a historically low activity in X-rays and VHE $\gamma$-rays from
mid-2017 to mid-2019 with a stable VHE flux ($&gt;$0.2 TeV) of 5% the emission of
the Crab Nebula. The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of this
2-year-long low-state, the potential baseline emission of Mrk 501, can be
characterized with one-zone leptonic models, and with (lepto)-hadronic models
fulfilling neutrino flux constraints from IceCube. We explore the time
evolution of the SED towards the low-state, revealing that the stable baseline
emission may be ascribed to a standing shock, and the variable emission to an
additional expanding or traveling shock.

					<dc:title>Exploring the limits of MEG spatial resolution with multipolar
  expansions</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Wens, Vincent</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Medical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The advent of scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on optically pumped
magnetometers (OPMs) may represent a step change in the field of human
electrophysiology. Compared to cryogenic MEG based on superconducting quantum
interference devices, scalp MEG promises significantly higher spatial
resolution imaging but it also comes with numerous challenges regarding how to
optimally design OPM arrays. In this context, we sought to provide a systematic
description of MEG spatial resolution as a function of the number of sensors,
sensor-to-brain distance, sensor type, and signal-to-noise ratio. To that aim,
we present an analytical theory based on MEG multipolar expansions that
enables, once supplemented with experimental input and simulations,
quantitative assessment of the limits of MEG spatial resolution in terms of two
qualitatively distinct regimes. In the regime of asymptotically high-density
MEG, we provide a mathematically rigorous description of how magnetic field
smoothness constraints spatial resolution to a slow, logarithmic divergence. In
the opposite regime of low-density MEG, it is sensor density that constraints
spatial resolution to a faster increase following a square-root law. The
transition between these two regimes controls how MEG spatial resolution
saturates as sensors approach sources of neural activity. This two-regime model
of MEG spatial resolution integrates known observations (e.g., the difficulty
of improving spatial resolution by increasing sensor density, the gain brought
by moving sensors on scalp, or the usefulness of multi-component sensors) and
gathers them under a unifying theoretical framework that highlights the
underlying physics and reveals properties inaccessible to simulations. We
propose that this framework may find useful applications to benchmark the
design of future OPM-based scalp MEG systems.

					<dc:description>  We derive a set of no-go theorems and yes-go examples for the parity-odd
primordial trispectrum of curvature perturbations. We work at tree-level in the
decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation and assume scale
invariance and a Bunch-Davies vacuum. We show that the parity-odd scalar
trispectrum vanishes in the presence of any number of scalar fields with
arbitrary mass and any parity-odd scalar correlator vanishes in the presence of
any number of spinning fields with massless de Sitter mode functions, in
agreement with the findings of Liu, Tong, Wang and Xianyu [1]. The same is true
for correlators with an odd number of conformally-coupled external fields. We
derive these results using both the (boostless) cosmological bootstrap, in
particular the Cosmological Optical Theorem, and explicit perturbative
calculations. We then discuss a series of yes-go examples by relaxing the above
assumptions one at the time. In particular, we provide explicit results for the
parity-odd trispectrum for (i) violations of scale invariance in single-clock
inflation, (ii) the modified dispersion relation of the ghost condensate
(non-Bunch-Davies vacuum), and (iii) interactions with massive spinning fields.
Our results establish the parity-odd trispectrum as an exceptionally sensitive
probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.

					<dc:description>  The critical analysis of the new experimental data obtained by the ATLAS
Collaboration group at 13 TeV is presented and the problem of the tension
between data of the ATLAS and TOTEM Collaboration is considered.
  The analysis of new effects discovered on the basis of experimental data at
13 TeV \cite{osc13,fd13} and associated with the specific properties of the
hadron potential at large distances is carried out
  taking account of all sets of experimental data on elastic $pp$-scattering
obtained by the TOTEM and ATLAS Collaborations in a wide momentum transfer
region. It also gives quantitative descriptions of all examined experimental
data with a minimum of fitting parameters. It is shown that the new features
determined at a high statistical level give an important contribution to the
differential cross sections and allow the research into hadron interactions at
large distances.

					<dc:description>  We demonstrate that some quantum teleportation protocols exhibit measurement
induced phase transitions in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Namely, Kitaev-Yoshida
and Gao-Jafferis-Wall protocols have a phase transition if we apply them at a
large projection rate or at a large coupling rate respectively. It is
well-known that at small rates they allow teleportation to happen only within a
small time-window. We show that at large rates, the system goes into a new
steady state, where the teleportation can be performed at any moment. In dual
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity these phase transitions correspond to the formation
of an eternal traversable wormhole. In the Kitaev-Yoshida case this novel type
of wormhole is supported by continuous projections.

					<dc:description>  We study many-body ground states for the partial integer fillings of the
$N=1$ Landau level in graphene, by constructing a model that accounts for the
lattice scale corrections to the Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, in
contrast to the $N=0$ Landau level, this model contains not only pure delta
function interactions but also some of its derivatives. Due to this we find
several important differences with respect to the $N=0$ Landau level. For
example at quarter filling when only a single component is filled, there is a
degeneracy lifting of the quantum hall ferromagnets and ground states with
entangled spin and valley degrees of freedom can become favourable. Moreover at
half-filling of the $N=1$ Landau level, we have found a new phase that is
absent in the $N=0$ Landau level, that combines characteristics of the
Kekul\'{e} state and an antiferromagnet. We also find that according to the
parameters extracted in a recent experiment, at half-filling of the $N=1$
Landau level graphene is expected to be in a delicate competition between an AF
and a CDW state, but we also discuss why the models for these recent
experiments might be missing some important terms.

					<dc:description>  While there have been advancements in autonomous driving control and traffic
simulation, there have been little to no works exploring their unification with
deep learning. Works in both areas seem to focus on entirely different
exclusive problems, yet traffic and driving are inherently related in the real
world. In this paper, we present Traffic-Aware Autonomous Driving (TrAAD), a
generalizable distillation-style method for traffic-informed imitation learning
that directly optimizes for faster traffic flow and lower energy consumption.
TrAAD focuses on the supervision of speed control in imitation learning
systems, as most driving research focuses on perception and steering. Moreover,
our method addresses the lack of co-simulation between traffic and driving
simulators and provides a basis for directly involving traffic simulation with
autonomous driving in future work. Our results show that, with information from
traffic simulation involved in the supervision of imitation learning methods,
an autonomous vehicle can learn how to accelerate in a fashion that is
beneficial for traffic flow and overall energy consumption for all nearby
vehicles.

					<dc:description>  Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status are
important prognostic markers for glioma. Currently, they are determined using
invasive procedures. Our goal was to develop artificial intelligence-based
methods to non-invasively determine these molecular alterations from MRI. For
this purpose, pre-operative MRI scans of 2648 patients with gliomas (grade
II-IV) were collected from Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM; n =
835) and publicly available datasets viz. Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS; n =
378), LGG 1p/19q (n = 159), Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP; n = 41),
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 461), and the Erasmus Glioma Database (EGD;
n = 774). A 2.5D hybrid convolutional neural network was proposed to
simultaneously localize the tumor and classify its molecular status by
leveraging imaging features from MR scans and prior knowledge features from
clinical records and tumor location. The models were tested on one internal
(TCGA) and two external (WUSM and EGD) test sets. For IDH, the best-performing
model achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of
0.925, 0.874, 0.933 and areas under the precision-recall curves (AUPRC) of
0.899, 0.702, 0.853 on the internal, WUSM, and EGD test sets, respectively. For
1p/19q, the best model achieved AUROCs of 0.782, 0.754, 0.842, and AUPRCs of
0.588, 0.713, 0.782, on those three data-splits, respectively. The high
accuracy of the model on unseen data showcases its generalization capabilities
and suggests its potential to perform a 'virtual biopsy' for tailoring
treatment planning and overall clinical management of gliomas.

					<dc:description>  As charge carrier of the macroscopic superconductivity, the Cooper pair is a
composite particle of two paired electrons, which has both center-of-mass and
inner-pair degrees of freedom. In most cases, these two different degrees of
freedom can be well described by the macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau theory and the
microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, respectively. Near the
superconducting phase transition where the Cooper pair is fragile and unstable
because of the small binding energy, there are non-trivial couplings between
these two different degrees of freedom due to such as finite energy and/or
momentum transfer. The non-trivial couplings make the original derivation of
the Ginzburg-Landau theory from the BCS theory fail in principle as where these
two different degrees of freedom should not be decoupled. In this manuscript,
we will present a renormalization formalism for an extended Ginzburg-Landau
action for the superconducting phase transition where there is finite energy
transfer between the center-of-mass and the inner-pair degrees of freedom of
Cooper pairs. This renormalization formalism will provide a theoretical tool to
study the unusual effects of the inner-pair time-retarded physics on the
superconducting phase transition.

					<dc:title>A convolution inequality, yielding a sharper Berry-Esseen theorem for
  summands Zolotarev-close to normal</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Mattner, Lutz</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The classical Berry-Esseen error bound, for the normal approximation to the
law of a sum of independent and identically distributed random variables, is
here improved by replacing the standardised third absolute moment by a weak
norm distance to normality. We thus sharpen and simplify two results of Ulyanov
(1976) and of Senatov (1998), each of them previously optimal, in the line of
research initiated by Zolotarev (1965) and Paulauskas (1969).
  Our proof is based on a seemingly incomparable normal approximation theorem
of Zolotarev (1986), combined with our main technical result:
  The Kolmogorov distance (supremum norm of difference of distribution
functions) between a convolution of two laws and a convolution of two Lipschitz
laws is bounded homogeneously of degree 1 in the pair of the Wasserstein
distances (L$^1$ norms of differences of distribution functions) of the
corresponding factors, and also, inessentially for the present application, in
the pair of the Lipschitz constants.
  Side results include a short introduction to $\zeta$ norms on the real line,
simpler inequalities for various probability distances, slight improvements of
the theorem of Zolotarev (1986) and of a lower bound theorem of Bobkov,
Chistyakov and G\&quot;otze (2012), an application to sampling from finite
populations, auxiliary results on rounding and on winsorisation, and
computations of a few examples.
  The introductory section in particular is aimed at analysts in general rather
than specialists in probability approximations.

					<dc:description>  A nuclear physics example of statistical bootstrap is used on the MARATHON
data nucleon structure function ratio, $\frac{F_2^n}{F_2^p}$, in the quark
momentum fraction $x_B\rightarrow0$ and $x_B\rightarrow1$ regions. The
extrapolated $F_2$ ratio value as quark momentum fraction $x_B\rightarrow 1$
approaches 0.4 and this value is compared to theoretical predictions. The
extrapolated ratio when $x_B\rightarrow 0$ favors the simple model of isospin
symmetry with the complete dominance of seaquarks at low momentum fraction. At
high-$x_B$, the proton quark distribution function ratio $d/u$ is derived from
the $x\rightarrow 1$ ratio $\frac{F_2^n}{F_2^p}\rightarrow 0.4$ and found to be
$d/u \rightarrow 1/6$. Our extrapolated values for both the
$\frac{F_2^n}{F_2^p}$ ratio and the $d/u$ parton distribution function ratio
most closely match perturbative QCD values from quark counting and helicity
conservation arguments but still differ by roughly $7\%$. The mismatch to
theoretical predictions may be ameliorated if two compatible models act
simultaneously in the nucleon wavefunction. One such example is nucleon
wavefunctions composed of a linear combination of a quark-diquark state and a
3-valence quark correlated state with coefficients that combine to give the
extrapolated $F_2$ ratio of $0.4$.

					<dc:description>  In large-scale metric localization, an incorrect result during retrieval will
lead to an incorrect pose estimate or loop closure. Re-ranking methods propose
to take into account all the top retrieval candidates and re-order them to
increase the likelihood of the top candidate being correct. However,
state-of-the-art re-ranking methods are inefficient when re-ranking many
potential candidates due to their need for resource intensive point cloud
registration between the query and each candidate. In this work, we propose an
efficient spectral method for geometric verification (named SpectralGV) that
does not require registration. We demonstrate how the optimal inter-cluster
score of the correspondence compatibility graph of two point clouds represents
a robust fitness score measuring their spatial consistency. This score takes
into account the subtle geometric differences between structurally similar
point clouds and therefore can be used to identify the correct candidate among
potential matches retrieved by global similarity search. SpectralGV is
deterministic, robust to outlier correspondences, and can be computed in
parallel for all potential candidates. We conduct extensive experiments on 5
large-scale datasets to demonstrate that SpectralGV outperforms other
state-of-the-art re-ranking methods and show that it consistently improves the
recall and pose estimation of 3 state-of-the-art metric localization
architectures while having a negligible effect on their runtime. The
open-source implementation and trained models are available at:

					<dc:description>  Robots operating in human-centered environments, such as retail stores,
restaurants, and households, are often required to distinguish between similar
objects in different contexts with a high degree of accuracy. However,
fine-grained object recognition remains a challenge in robotics due to the high
intra-category and low inter-category dissimilarities. In addition, the limited
number of fine-grained 3D datasets poses a significant problem in addressing
this issue effectively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-modal Vision
Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach to improve
the performance of fine-grained visual classification (FGVC). To address the
shortage of FGVC 3D datasets, we generated two synthetic datasets. The first
dataset consists of 20 categories related to restaurants with a total of 100
instances, while the second dataset contains 120 shoe instances. Our approach
was evaluated on both datasets, and the results indicate that it outperforms
both CNN-only and ViT-only baselines, achieving a recognition accuracy of 94.50
% and 93.51 % on the restaurant and shoe datasets, respectively. Additionally,
we have made our FGVC RGB-D datasets available to the research community to
enable further experimentation and advancement. Furthermore, we successfully
integrated our proposed method with a robot framework and demonstrated its
potential as a fine-grained perception tool in both simulated and real-world
robotic scenarios.

					<dc:description>  Cooperative multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) algorithms have recently
attracted wide attention and are regarded as a general scheme for the
multi-agent system. Credit assignment plays an important role in MAPG and can
induce cooperation among multiple agents. However, most MAPG algorithms cannot
achieve good credit assignment because of the game-theoretic pathology known as
\textit{centralized-decentralized mismatch}. To address this issue, this paper
presents a novel method, \textit{\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent
\underline{P}olarization \underline{P}olicy \underline{G}radient} (MAPPG).
MAPPG takes a simple but efficient polarization function to transform the
optimal consistency of joint and individual actions into easily realized
constraints, thus enabling efficient credit assignment in MAPG. Theoretically,
we prove that individual policies of MAPPG can converge to the global optimum.
Empirically, we evaluate MAPPG on the well-known matrix game and differential
game, and verify that MAPPG can converge to the global optimum for both
discrete and continuous action spaces. We also evaluate MAPPG on a set of
StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and demonstrate that MAPPG outperforms the
state-of-the-art MAPG algorithms.

					<dc:description>  Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV) can change the threshold behavior
predicted by special relativity and cause threshold anomalies which affect the
propagation of cosmic photons. In this work, we focus on the threshold anomaly
effect on cosmic photon attenuations by extragalactic background light~(EBL)
and discuss how to identify LIV from observations of very high energy~(VHE)
photons propagated from long distance in the universe. We point out that the
Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), one of the most sensitive
gamma-ray detector arrays currently operating at TeV and PeV energies, is an
ideal facility for performing such LIV searching. We apply the proposed
strategy to discuss the newly observed gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A to
demonstrate the predictive ability of our suggestions.

					<dc:description>  In real life, success is often contingent upon multiple critical steps that
are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical
steps can be challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning
(RL) methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we
present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to identify
critical steps in any task. This algorithm, which we call contrastive
introspection (ConSpec ), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec
learns a set of prototypes for the critical steps in a task and delivers an
intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these prototypes. The
prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit assignment: (1) They
enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2) They do so in a
readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution generalization when
sensory features are altered. We show that ConSpec improves learning in both
tasks with explicit critical steps (e.g. when a key must be collected to open a
door) and tasks with no immediately obvious critical steps (e.g. continuous
control tasks). In summary, ConSpec is a modular component that can be added to
any existing RL algorithm to improve performance.

					<dc:title>Face Super-Resolution with Progressive Embedding of Multi-scale Face

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The face super-resolution (FSR) task is to reconstruct high-resolution face
images from low-resolution inputs. Recent works have achieved success on this
task by utilizing facial priors such as facial landmarks. Most existing methods
pay more attention to global shape and structure information, but less to local
texture information, which makes them cannot recover local details well. In
this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional network based framework
for face super-resolution, which progressively introduces both global shape and
local texture information. We take full advantage of the intermediate outputs
of the recurrent network, and landmarks information and facial action units
(AUs) information are extracted in the output of the first and second steps
respectively, rather than low-resolution input. Moreover, we introduced AU
classification results as a novel quantitative metric for facial details
restoration. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art FSR methods in terms of image quality and facial
details restoration.

					<dc:description>  The growing interest in accessible software reflects in computing educators'
and education researchers' efforts to include accessibility in core computing
education. We integrated accessibility in a junior/senior-level Android app
development course at a large private university in India. The course
introduced three accessibility-related topics using various interventions:
Accessibility Awareness (a guest lecture by a legal expert), Technical
Knowledge (lectures on Android accessibility guidelines and testing practices
and graded components for implementing accessibility in programming
assignments), and Empathy (an activity that required students to blindfold
themselves and interact with their phones using a screen-reader). We evaluated
their impact on student learning using three instruments: (A) A pre/post-course
questionnaire, (B) Reflective questions on each of the four programming
assignments, and (C) Midterm and Final exam questions. Our findings demonstrate
that: (A) significantly more ($p&lt;.05$) students considered disabilities when
designing an app after taking this course, (B) many students developed empathy
towards the challenges persons with disabilities face while using inaccessible
apps, and (C) all students could correctly identify at least one accessibility
issue in the user interface of a real-world app given its screenshot, and 90%
of them could provide a correct solution to fix it.

					<dc:description>  This article discusses variants of Weber's class number problem in the spirit
of arithmetic topology to connect the results of Sinnott--Kisilevsky and
Kionke. Let $p$ be a prime number. We first prove the $p$-adic convergence of
class numbers in a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of a global field and a similar
result in a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-cover of a compact 3-manifold. Secondly, we
establish an explicit formula for the $p$-adic limit of the $p$-power-th cyclic
resultants of a polynomial using roots of unity of orders prime to $p$, the
$p$-adic logarithm, and the Iwasawa invariants. Finally, we give thorough
investigations of torus knots, twist knots, and elliptic curves; we complete
the list of the cases with $p$-adic limits being in $\mathbb{Z}$ and find the
cases such that the base $p$-class numbers are small and $\nu$'s are
arbitrarily large.

					<dc:description>  Amodal Instance Segmentation (AIS) aims to segment the region of both visible
and possible occluded parts of an object instance. While Mask R-CNN-based AIS
approaches have shown promising results, they are unable to model high-level
features coherence due to the limited receptive field. The most recent
transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision tasks, even
better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we present
AISFormer, an AIS framework, with a Transformer-based mask head. AISFormer
explicitly models the complex coherence between occluder, visible, amodal, and
invisible masks within an object's regions of interest by treating them as
learnable queries. Specifically, AISFormer contains four modules: (i) feature
encoding: extract ROI and learn both short-range and long-range visual
features. (ii) mask transformer decoding: generate the occluder, visible, and
amodal mask query embeddings by a transformer decoder (iii) invisible mask
embedding: model the coherence between the amodal and visible masks, and (iv)
mask predicting: estimate output masks including occluder, visible, amodal and
invisible. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on three
challenging benchmarks i.e. KINS, D2SA, and COCOA-cls to evaluate the
effectiveness of AISFormer. The code is available at:

					<dc:description>  It has been reported that the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory
(LHAASO) observed very high energy photons from GRB 221009A, with the highest
energy reaching 18~TeV. We find that observation of such high energy photons is
quite nontrivial since extragalactic background light could absorb these
photons severely and the flux is too weak to be observed. Therefore we discuss
a potential mechanism for us to observe these photons, and suggest that Lorentz
invariance violation induced threshold anomaly of the process \(\gamma\gamma\to
e^-e^+\) provides a candidate to explain this phenomenon.

					<dc:description>  Meeting both scalability and performance portability requirements is a
challenge for any HPC application, especially for adaptively refined ones. In
Octo-Tiger, an astrophysics application for the simulation of stellar mergers,
we approach this with existing solutions: We employ HPX to obtain fine-grained
tasks to easily distribute work and finely overlap communication and
computation. For the computations themselves, we use Kokkos to turn these tasks
into compute kernels capable of running on hardware ranging from a few CPU
cores to powerful accelerators. There is a missing link, however: while the
fine-grained parallelism exposed by HPX is useful for scalability, it can
hinder GPU performance when the tasks become too small to saturate the device,
causing low resource utilization. To bridge this gap, we investigate multiple
different GPU work aggregation strategies within Octo-Tiger, adding one new
strategy, and evaluate the node-level performance impact on recent AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs, achieving noticeable speedups.

					<dc:description>  Diverse and realistic traffic scenarios are crucial for evaluating the AI
safety of autonomous driving systems in simulation. This work introduces a
data-driven method called TrafficGen for traffic scenario generation. It learns
from the fragmented human driving data collected in the real world and then can
generate realistic traffic scenarios. TrafficGen is an autoregressive
generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture. In each autoregressive
iteration, it first encodes the current traffic context with the attention
mechanism and then decodes a vehicle's initial state followed by generating its
long trajectory. We evaluate the trained model in terms of vehicle placement
and trajectories and show substantial improvements over baselines. TrafficGen
can be also used to augment existing traffic scenarios, by adding new vehicles
and extending the fragmented trajectories. We further demonstrate that
importing the generated scenarios into a simulator as interactive training
environments improves the performance and the safety of driving policy learned
from reinforcement learning. More project resource is available at

					<dc:description>  We introduce a new wave phenomenon, which can be observed in continuum and
discrete systems, where a trapped mode exists under certain conditions, namely,
the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves. This is zeroing of the
non-localized propagating component of the wave-field in a neighbourhood of an
inclusion. In other words, it is a tendency for non-stationary waves to
propagate avoiding a neighbourhood of an inclusion. The anti-localization is
caused by a destructive interference of the harmonics involved into the
representation of the solution in the form of a Fourier integral. The
anti-localization is associated with the waves from the pass-band, whereas the
localization related with a trapped mode is due to poles inside the stop-band.
In the framework of a simple illustrative problem considered in the paper, we
have demonstrated that the anti-localization exists for all cases excepting the
boundary of the domain in the parameter space where the wave localization
occurs. Thus, the anti-localization can be observed in the absence of the
localization as well as together with the localization. We also investigate the
influence of the anti-localization on the wave-field in whole.

					<dc:description>  We show that quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements can be used to realize
measurement-based imaginary time evolution. In our proposed scheme, repeated
weak QND measurements are used to estimate the energy of a given Hamiltonian.
Based on this estimated energy, adaptive unitary operations are applied such
that only the targeted energy eigenstates are fixed points of the evolution. In
this way, the system is deterministically driven towards the desired state. The
nonlinear nature of the QND measurement, which allows for producing
interactions between systems, is explicitly derived in terms of measurement
operators. We show that for suitable interaction times, single qubit QND
Hamiltonians can be converted to effective multi-qubit imaginary time
operations. We illustrate our techniques with the example of preparing a four
qubit cluster state, which is prepared using only collective single qubit QND
measurements and single qubit adaptive operations.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we present a spherical Fast Multipole Method (sFMM) for ray
tracing simulation of gravitational lensing (GL) on a curved sky. The sFMM is a
non-trivial extension of the Fast Multiple Method (FMM) to sphere $\mathbb
S^2$, and it can accurately solve the Poisson equation with time complexity of
$O(N)\log(N)$, where $N$ is the number of particles. It is found that the time
complexity of the sFMM is near $O(N)$ and the computational accuracy can reach
$10^{-10}$ in our test. In addition, compared with the Fast Spherical Harmonic
Transform (FSHT), the sFMM is not only faster but more accurate, as it has the
ability to reserve high-frequency components of the density field. These merits
make the sFMM an optimum method to simulate the gravitational lensing on a
curved sky, which is the case for upcoming large-area sky surveys, such as the
Vera Rubin Observatory and the China Space Station Telescope.

					<dc:description>  We explore the spin and charge currents arising on the surface of a
topological insulator and in a 2D Rashba metal due to magnetization gradients.
For topological insulators a single interconversion coefficient controls the
generation of both quantities. This coefficient is quantized to a value
proportional to the vorticity of the Dirac point. As we show here, this effect
is a hallmark of parity anomaly at finite density. Moreover, it unveils a
robust route to disentangle and detect the protected states of a topological
insulator on a given surface. Rashba metals also exhibit quantization
phenomena, which however are not as robust against weak disorder. We find that
the interconversion coefficients exhibit anomalies and a nontrivial interplay
upon varying the chemical potential, the strength of the spin-orbit coupling,
and a pairing gap. Our results have implications for the binding between
magnetic skyrmions and superconducting vortices, the emergence of Majorana zero
modes, and pave the way for superconducting diode effects mediated by
out-of-plane magnetization gradients.

					<dc:description>  The Santa Claus problem is a fundamental problem in fair division: the goal
is to partition a set of heterogeneous items among heterogeneous agents so as
to maximize the minimum value of items received by any agent. In this paper, we
study the online version of this problem where the items are not known in
advance and have to be assigned to agents as they arrive over time. If the
arrival order of items is arbitrary, then no good assignment rule exists in the
worst case. However, we show that, if the arrival order is random, then for $n$
agents and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of
$1-\varepsilon$ when the optimal assignment gives value at least $\Omega(\log n
/ \varepsilon^2)$ to every agent (assuming each item has at most unit value).
We also show that this result is almost tight: namely, if the optimal solution
has value at most $C \ln n / \varepsilon$ for some constant $C$, then there is
no $(1-\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm even for random arrival order.

					<dc:description>  Many current NLP systems are built from language models trained to optimize
unsupervised objectives on large amounts of raw text. Under what conditions
might such a procedure acquire meaning? Our systematic experiments with
synthetic data reveal that, with languages where all expressions have
context-independent denotations (i.e., languages with strong transparency),
both autoregressive and masked language models successfully learn to emulate
semantic relations between expressions. However, when denotations are changed
to be context-dependent with the language otherwise unmodified, this ability
degrades. Turning to natural language, our experiments with a specific
phenomenon -- referential opacity -- add to the growing body of evidence that
current language models do not represent natural language semantics well. We
show this failure relates to the context-dependent nature of natural language
form-meaning mappings.

					<dc:description>  We consider a specific random graph which serves as a disordered medium for a
particle performing biased random walk. Take a two-sided infinite horizontal
ladder and pick a random spanning tree with a certain edge weight $c$ for the
(vertical) rungs. Now take a random walk on that spanning tree with a bias
$\beta&gt;1$ to the right. In contrast to other random graphs considered in the
literature (random percolation clusters, Galton-Watson trees) this one allows
for an explicit analysis based on a decomposition of the graph into independent
pieces.
  We give an explicit formula for the speed of the biased random walk as a
function of both the bias $\beta$ and the edge weight $c$. We conclude that the
speed is a continuous, unimodal function of $\beta$ that is positive if and
only if $\beta &lt; \beta_c^{(1)}$ for an explicit critical value $\beta_c^{(1)}$
depending on $c$. In particular, the phase transition at $\beta_c^{(1)}$ is of
second order.
  We show that another second order phase transition takes place at another
critical value $\beta_c^{(2)}&lt;\beta_c^{(1)}$ that is also explicitly known: For
$\beta&lt;\beta_c^{(2)}$ the times the walker spends in traps have second moments
and (after subtracting the linear speed) the position fulfills a central limit
theorem. We see that $\beta_c^{(2)}$ is smaller than the value of $\beta$ which
achieves the maximal value of the speed. Finally, concerning linear response,
we confirm the Einstein relation for the unbiased model ($\beta=1$) by proving
a central limit theorem and computing the variance.

					<dc:description>  Characterizing self-interference is essential to the design and evaluation of
in-band full-duplex communication systems. Until now, little has been
understood about this coupling in full-duplex systems operating at millimeter
wave (mmWave) frequencies, and it has been shown that the highly-idealized
models proposed for such do not align with practice. This work presents the
first spatial and statistical model of mmWave self-interference backed by
measurements, enabling engineers to draw realizations that exhibit the
large-scale and small-scale spatial characteristics observed in our nearly 6.5
million measurements taken at 28 GHz. Core to our model is its use of system
and model parameters having real-world meaning, which facilitates its extension
to systems beyond our own phased array platform through proper
parameterization. We demonstrate this by collecting nearly 13 million
additional measurements to show that our model can generalize to two other
system configurations. We assess our model by comparing it against actual
measurements to confirm its ability to align spatially and in distribution with
real-world self-interference. In addition, using both measurements and our
model of self-interference, we evaluate an existing beamforming-based
full-duplex mmWave solution to illustrate that our model can be reliably used
to design new solutions and validate the performance improvements they may
offer.

					<dc:description>  Surface roughness plays a critical role and has effects in, e.g. fluid
dynamics or contact mechanics. For example, to evaluate fluid behavior at
different roughness properties, real-world or numerical experiments are
performed. Numerical simulations of rough surfaces can speed up these studies
because they can help collect more relevant information. However, it is hard to
simulate rough surfaces with deterministic or structured components in current
methods. In this work, we present a novel approach to simulate rough surfaces
with a Gaussian process (GP) and a noise model because GPs can model structured
and periodic elements. GPs generalize traditional methods and are not
restricted to stationarity so they can simulate a wider range of rough
surfaces. In this paper, we summarize the theoretical similarities of GPs with
auto-regressive moving-average processes and introduce a linear process view of
GPs. We also show examples of ground and honed surfaces simulated by a
predefined model. The proposed method can also be used to fit a model to
measurement data of a rough surface. In particular, we demonstrate this to
model turned profiles and surfaces that are inherently periodic.

					<dc:description>  The pretasks are mainly built on mutual information estimation, which
requires data augmentation to construct positive samples with similar semantics
to learn invariant signals and negative samples with dissimilar semantics in
order to empower representation discriminability. However, an appropriate data
augmentation configuration depends heavily on lots of empirical trials such as
choosing the compositions of data augmentation techniques and the corresponding
hyperparameter settings. We propose an augmentation-free graph contrastive
learning method, invariant-discriminative graph contrastive learning (iGCL),
that does not intrinsically require negative samples. iGCL designs the
invariant-discriminative loss (ID loss) to learn invariant and discriminative
representations. On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly
minimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive
samples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that
the representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the
different dimensions of representations to be independent of each other. This
prevents representations from collapsing to a point or subspace. Our
theoretical analysis explains the effectiveness of ID loss from the
perspectives of the redundancy reduction criterion, canonical correlation
analysis, and information bottleneck principle. The experimental results
demonstrate that iGCL outperforms all baselines on 5 node classification
benchmark datasets. iGCL also shows superior performance for different label
ratios and is capable of resisting graph attacks, which indicates that iGCL has
excellent generalization and robustness. The source code is available at
https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN/tree/master/iGCL.

					<dc:description>  Photonic integrated circuits are facilitating the development of optical
neural networks, which have the potential to be both faster and more energy
efficient than their electronic counterparts since optical signals are
especially well-suited for implementing matrix multiplications. However,
accurate programming of photonic chips for optical matrix multiplication
remains a difficult challenge. Here, we describe both simple analytical models
and data-driven models for offline training of optical matrix multipliers. We
train and evaluate the models using experimental data obtained from a
fabricated chip featuring a Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh implementing
3-by-3 matrix multiplication. The neural network-based models outperform the
simple physics-based models in terms of prediction error. Furthermore, the
neural network models are also able to predict the spectral variations in the
matrix weights for up to 100 frequency channels covering the C-band. The use of
neural network models for programming the chip for optical matrix
multiplication yields increased performance on multiple machine learning tasks.

					<dc:description>  Precise measurements of the boron-to-carbon and boron-to-oxygen ratios by
DAMPE show clear hardenings around $100$ GeV/n, which provide important
implications on the production, propagation, and interaction of Galactic cosmic
rays. In this work we investigate a number of models proposed in literature in
light of the DAMPE findings. These models can roughly be classified into two
classes, driven by propagation effects or by source ones. Among these models
discussed, we find that the re-acceleration of cosmic rays, during their
propagation, by random magnetohydrodynamic waves may not reproduce sufficient
hardenings of B/C and B/O, and an additional spectral break of the diffusion
coefficient is required. The other models can properly explain the hardenings
of the ratios. However, depending on simplifications assumed, the models differ
in their quality in reproducing the data in a wide energy range. The models
with significant re-acceleration effect will under-predict low-energy
antiprotons but over-predict low-energy positrons, and the models with
secondary production at sources over-predict high-energy antiprotons. For all
models high-energy positron excess exists.

					<dc:description>  Motivated by the compound ${\rm LiHo}_x{\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm F}_4$, we consider
the Ising chain with random couplings and in the presence of simultaneous
random transverse and longitudinal fields, and study its low-energy properties
at zero temperature by the strong disorder renormalization group approach. In
the absence of longitudinal fields, the system exhibits a quantum-ordered and a
quantum-disordered phase separated by a critical point of infinite disorder.
When the longitudinal random field is switched on, the ordered phase vanishes
and the trajectories of the renormalization group are attracted to two
disordered fixed points: one is characteristic of the classical random field
Ising chain, the other describes the quantum disordered phase. The two
disordered phases are separated by a separatrix that starts at the infinite
disorder fixed point and near which there are strong quantum fluctuations.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the returns to adolescent friendships on earnings in
adulthood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health, we document that individuals make investments to accumulate
friends in addition to educational investments. Because both education and
friendships are jointly determined in adolescence, OLS estimates of their
returns are biased. To estimate the causal returns to friendships, we implement
a novel procedure that assumes the returns to schooling range from 5 to 15% (as
the literature has documented), and instrument for friendships using homophily
(similarity) measures among peers to obtain bounds on the returns to
friendships. We find that having one more friend in adolescence increases
earnings between 7 and 14%, which is substantially larger than the OLS
estimates: measurement error and omitted variables lead to significant downward
bias. We also find suggestive evidence that although some friendships generate
larger returns in the labor market (close friendships, friendships with high
SES individuals), most friendships appear to have positive returns. Individuals
with more friendships in adolescence obtain more schooling and become more
social and connected adults, in turn making them more likely to work and to
work in higher paying occupations where social skills are rewarded.

					<dc:description>  The low-level sensory and motor signals in deep reinforcement learning, which
exist in high-dimensional spaces such as image observations or motor torques,
are inherently challenging to understand or utilize directly for downstream
tasks. While sensory representations have been extensively studied, the
representations of motor actions are still an area of active exploration. Our
work reveals that a space containing meaningful action representations emerges
when a multi-task policy network takes as inputs both states and task
embeddings. Moderate constraints are added to improve its representation
ability. Therefore, interpolated or composed embeddings can function as a
high-level interface within this space, providing instructions to the agent for
executing meaningful action sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the
proposed action representations are effective for intra-action interpolation
and inter-action composition with limited or no additional learning.
Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior task adaptation ability compared to
strong baselines in Mujoco locomotion tasks. Our work sheds light on the
promising direction of learning action representations for efficient,
adaptable, and composable RL, forming the basis of abstract action planning and
the understanding of motor signal space. Project page:

					<dc:description>  The influence of neutrino flavor oscillations on the propagation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities is studied in neutrino-beam
driven magnetoplasmas. Using the neutrino MHD model, a general dispersion
relation is derived which manifests the resonant interactions of MHD waves, not
only with the neutrino beam, but also with the neutrino flavor oscillations. It
is found that the latter contribute to the wave dispersion and enhance the
magnitude of the instability of oblique magnetosonic waves. However, the
shear-Alfv{\'e}n wave remains unaffected by the neutrino beam and neutrino
flavor oscillations. Such an enhancement of the magnitude of the instability of
magnetosonic waves can be significant for relatively long-wavelength
perturbations in the regimes of high neutrino number density and/or strong
magnetic field, giving a convincing mechanism for type-II core-collapse
supernova explosion.

					<dc:description>  We extend our recently proposed Deep Learning-aided many-body dispersion
(DNN-MBD) model to quadrupole polarizability (Q) terms using a generalized
Random Phase Approximation (RPA) formalism, thus enabling the inclusion of van
der Waals contributions beyond dipole. The resulting DNN-MBDQ model only relies
on ab initio-derived quantities as the introduced quadrupole polarizabilities
are recursively retrieved from dipole ones, in turn modelled via the
Tkatchenko-Scheffler method. A transferable and efficient deep-neuronal network
(DNN) provides atom in molecule volumes, while a single range-separation
parameter is used to couple the model to Density Functional Theory (DFT). Since
it can be computed at a negligible cost, the DNN-MBDQ approach can be coupled
with DFT functionals such as PBE,PBE0 and B86bPBE (dispersionless). The
DNN-MBQ-corrected functionals reach chemical accuracy while exhibiting lower
errors compared to their dipole-only counterparts.

					<dc:description>  Fix an integer $d\geq 1$. Solomon counts index-$n$ submodules of the free
module $R^d$ for any Dedekind domain $R$ that admits a Dedekind zeta function.
The proof involves the Hermite normal form for matrices. We propose another
normal form in the case where $R=\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]$, which unlike the Hermite
normal form, recovers the Smith normal form. We use our normal form to give a
uniform approach to Solomon's result and a refinement of it due to
Petrogradsky, which counts finite-index submodules $M$ of $R^d$ such that
$R^d/M$ has a given module structure. Our normal form and Hermite's can be
interpreted as reduced Gr\&quot;obner bases with respect to two different monomial
orders. Counting with our normal form gives rise to a ``total distance''
statistics $W$ and certain ``spiral shifting'' operators $g_1,\dots,g_d$ on the
set $X=\mathbb{N}^d$ of $d$-tuples of nonnegative integers. These combinatorial
structures are of independent interest. We show that these operators commute,
and collectively act on $X$ freely and transitively, which in particular gives
a nontrivial self-bijection on $\mathbb{N}^d$. We give a formula on how $g_j$
interacts with the $W$-statistics on $X$, leading to a rational formula for the
generating function for $W$-statistics over any forward orbit in $X$ under
these operators.

					<dc:description>  For readability assessment, traditional methods mainly employ machine
learning classifiers with hundreds of linguistic features. Although the deep
learning model has become the prominent approach for almost all NLP tasks, it
is less explored for readability assessment. In this paper, we propose a
BERT-based model with feature projection and length-balanced loss (BERT-FP-LBL)
for readability assessment. Specially, we present a new difficulty knowledge
guided semi-supervised method to extract topic features to complement the
traditional linguistic features. From the linguistic features, we employ
projection filtering to extract orthogonal features to supplement BERT
representations. Furthermore, we design a new length-balanced loss to handle
the greatly varying length distribution of data. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performances on two English benchmark datasets and one dataset
of Chinese textbooks, and also achieves the near-perfect accuracy of 99\% on
one English dataset. Moreover, our proposed model obtains comparable results
with human experts in consistency test.

					<dc:description>  We investigate relativistic star solutions in Mass-Varying Massive Gravity
(MVMG) with a diagonal metric. Contrary to the intuition that there is no
fundamental difference between diagonal metric and non-diagonal metric
solutions regarding relativistic stars, we find that with a diagonal metric,
well-behaved relativistic star solutions may not exist except for trivial ones
in which the graviton mass is a constant, whereas non-trivial relativistic star
solutions had been found in MVMG with a non-diagonal metric. The reason is that
with a diagonal metric, the field equations constitute a system of
differential-algebraic equations of differential index-2 with two extra
constraints that have a significant influence on the system, rendering the
relativistic star solution with a non-trivial graviton mass configuration
impossible in most cases.

					<dc:description>  Telepresence aims to create an immersive but virtual experience of the audio
and visual scene at the far end for users at the near end. In this
contribution, we propose an array-based binaural rendering system that converts
the array microphone signals into the head-related transfer function (HRTF)
filtered output signals for headphone-rendering. The proposed approach is
formulated in light of a model-matching principle (MMP) and is capable of
delivering more immersive experience than the conventional
localization-beamforming-HRTF filtering (LBH) approach. The MMP-based rendering
system can be realized via multichannel inverse filtering (MIF) and
multichannel deep filtering (MDF). In this study, we adopted the MDF approach
and used the LBH as well as MIF as the baselines. The all-neural system jointly
captures the spatial information (spatial rendering), preserves ambient sound
(enhancement), and reduces noise (enhancement) before generating binaural
outputs. Objective and subjective tests are employed to compare the proposed
telepresence system with two baselines.

$-1 &lt; q &lt; 1$. We show that $M_q(H_{\mathbb{R}}) \not \simeq

					<dc:description>  The ultrafast and element-specific response of magnetic systems containing
ferromagnetic 3d transition metals and 4d/5d heavy metals is of interest from
both a fundamental as well as an applied research perspective. However, to date
no consensus about the main microscopic processes describing the interplay
between intrinsic 3d and induced 4d/5d magnetic moments upon femtosecond laser
excitation exist. In this work, we study the ultrafast response of CoFeB/Pt
bilayers with resonant, core-hole spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet
spectral range using high harmonic radiation. We show that the combination of
magnetic scattering simulations and analysis of the energy- and time-dependent
magnetic asymmetries allows to accurately disentangle the element-specific
response in spite of overlapping Co and Fe M$_{2,3}$ as well as Pt O$_{2,3}$
and N$_7$ resonances. We find a considerably smaller demagnetization time
constant as well as much larger demagnetization amplitudes of the induced
moment of Pt compared to the intrinsic moment of CoFeB. Our results are in
agreement with enhanced spin-flip probabilities due to the higher spin-orbit
coupling localized at the heavy metal Pt compared to Fe and Co, as well as with
the recently formulated hypothesis of a strong sensitivity to the average spin
orientation between intrinsic and induced magnetic moments following a laser
generated incoherent magnon population.

					<dc:description>  We integrate a long-lived memory qubit into a mixed-species trapped-ion
quantum network node. Ion-photon entanglement first generated with a network
qubit in Sr-88 is transferred to Ca-43 with 0.977(7) fidelity, and mapped to a
robust memory qubit. We then entangle the network qubit with another photon,
which does not affect the memory qubit. We perform quantum state tomography to
show that the fidelity of ion-photon entanglement decays ~100 times slower on
the memory qubit. Dynamical decoupling further extends the storage time; we
measure an ion-photon entanglement fidelity of 0.81(4) after 10s.

					<dc:description>  The cell nucleus is enveloped by a complex membrane, whose wrinkling has been
implicated in disease and cellular aging. The biophysical dynamics and spectral
evolution of nuclear wrinkling during multicellular development remain poorly
understood due to a lack of direct quantitative measurements. Here, we combine
live-imaging experiments, theory, and simulations to characterize the onset and
dynamics of nuclear wrinkling during egg development in the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster, when nurse cell nuclei increase in size and display
stereotypical wrinkling behavior. A spectral analysis of three-dimensional
high-resolution data from several hundred nuclei reveals a robust asymptotic
power-law scaling of angular fluctuations consistent with renormalization and
scaling predictions from a nonlinear elastic shell model. We further
demonstrate that nuclear wrinkling can be reversed through osmotic shock and
suppressed by microtubule disruption, providing tunable physical and biological
control parameters for probing mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope.
Our findings advance the biophysical understanding of nuclear membrane
fluctuations during early multicellular development.

					<dc:title>Optimizing Higgs Boson Reconstruction Efficiency with Small-R (R = 0.4)
  and Large-R (R = 1.0) Jets</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Kadan, Sophie</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Experiment</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Many Beyond the Standard Model searches at ATLAS employ jets to simplify
event reconstruction. These jets cluster particle shower products into
calculable objects, which are then used to obtain information about parent
particles. Large-R (R = 1.0) jets combine these products into one jet that
spans 2 radians, while small-R (R = 0.4) jets are used to further refine
individual b-quark trajectories. Optimizing the use of jets is crucial for
making precision measurements of Higgs bosons with high transverse momenta, and
this paper uses b-quarks produced in the Wino chargino LSP decay to identify
parameters that best do so. Monte Carlo simulation found that parameters such
as the distance between Higgs bosons and the distance between b-jets were
relevant in selecting the most accurate small-R reconstructions. Truth data
analysis corroborated the paper's findings, especially for charginos with
higher mass. These parameters were then used to refine small-R jet selection,
increasing reconstruction efficiency across chargino masses. Further analysis
into large-R jet selection would enhance these results, especially at higher
chargino masses. A neural network would also prove useful for exploring the
effects of combinations of parameters across chargino masses.

					<dc:description>  Universal sound separation consists of separating mixes with arbitrary sounds
of different types, and permutation invariant training (PIT) is used to train
source agnostic models that do so. In this work, we complement PIT with
adversarial losses but find it challenging with the standard formulation used
in speech source separation. We overcome this challenge with a novel
I-replacement context-based adversarial loss, and by training with multiple
discriminators. Our experiments show that by simply improving the loss (keeping
the same model and dataset) we obtain a non-negligible improvement of 1.4 dB
SI-SNRi in the reverberant FUSS dataset. We also find adversarial PIT to be
effective at reducing spectral holes, ubiquitous in mask-based separation
models, which highlights the potential relevance of adversarial losses for
source separation.

					<dc:description>  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a prevalent learning paradigm
for solving stochastic games. In most MARL studies, agents in a game are
defined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the
agents remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the
agent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing.
Many multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This
question arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the
kindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of
imperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that
needs to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection
reinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically
infer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to
accomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed
to deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the
agents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive
identifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the
need to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After
identifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies
one of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the
proposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card-shedding game, and the
results show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other
state-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par
performance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the
danger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification. The code
to reproduce all the reported results is available online at
https://github.com/MR-BENjie/IDRL.

					<dc:description>  On a smooth manifold with distributions ${\cal D}_1$ and ${\cal D}_2$ having
trivial intersection, we consider the integral of their mutual curvature, as a
functional of Riemannian metrics that make the distributions orthogonal. The
mutual curvature is defined as the sum of sectional curvatures of planes
spanned by all pairs of vectors from an orthonormal basis, such that one vector
of the pair belongs to ${\cal D}_1$ and the second vector belongs to ${\cal
D}_2$. As such, it interpolates between the sectional curvature of a plane
field (if both distributions are one-dimensional), and the mixed scalar
curvature of a Riemannian almost product structure (if both distributions
together span the tangent bundle). We derive Euler-Lagrange equations for the
functional, formulated in terms of extrinsic geometry of distributions, i.e.,
their second fundamental forms and integrability tensors. We give examples of
critical metrics for distributions defined on domains of Riemannian
submersions, twisted products and $f$-$K$-contact manifolds.

					<dc:description>  AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, K, Rb) are recently discovered superconducting systems
($T_{\rm c}\sim0.9-2.5$ K) in which the vanadium atoms adopt the kagome
structure. Intriguingly, these systems enter a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase
($T_{\rm CDW}\sim80-100$ K), and further evidence shows that the time-reversal
symmetry is broken in the CDW phase. Concurrently, the anomalous Hall effect
has been observed in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ inside the novel CDW phase.
Here, we report a comprehensive study of a high-quality RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ single
crystal with magnetotransport measurements. Our data demonstrate the emergence
of anomalous Hall effect in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when the charge-density-wave state
develops. The magnitude of anomalous Hall resistivity at the low temperature
limit is comparable to the reported values in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.
The magnetoresistance channel further reveals a rich spectrum of quantum
oscillation frequencies, many of which have not been reported before. In
particular, a large quantum oscillation frequency (2235 T), which occupies
$\sim$56% of the Brillouin zone area, has been recorded. For the quantum
oscillation frequencies with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, we further
perform field-angle dependent measurements and our data indicate
two-dimensional Fermi surfaces in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results provide
indispensable information for understanding the anomalous Hall effect and band
structure in kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

					<dc:description>  In extensive air shower experiments, the number of muons crossing a detector
at a given position, as well as their arrival time, arrival direction, and
energy, are determined by a more fundamental 3-dimensional distribution linked
to the hadronic core of the shower. Muons are produced high up in the
atmosphere after the decay of mesons in the hadronic cascade. The distributions
of production depth, energy, and transverse momentum of muons are enough to
fully predict the muon component of air showers in any particular observational
condition. By using air-shower simulations with the state-of-the-art hadronic
interaction models, the mentioned distributions at production are analyzed as a
function of zenith angle, primary mass, and hadronic interaction model, and
their level of universality is studied and assessed in an exhaustive manner for
the first time.

					<dc:description>  We study quasi-particle dynamics in a quasi-periodic Ising model with
temporally fluctuating transverse fields. Specifically, we calculate the
dynamical exponents of the standard deviation of a quasi-particle spreading
under a field chosen randomly from binary values $\pm h$ at every time
interval. We find that the short-time behavior of the dynamical exponents
depends on the interval of the temporally fluctuating fields. We also reveal
how the quasi-particle dynamics affects the relaxation of spin-spin correlation
functions. The dynamics can be explained via the overlap between the
eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian with $\pm h$.

					<dc:description>  Provenance encodes information that connects datasets, their generation
workflows, and associated metadata (e.g., who or when executed a query). As
such, it is instrumental for a wide range of critical governance applications
(e.g., observability and auditing). Unfortunately, in the context of database
systems, extracting coarse-grained provenance is a long-standing problem due to
the complexity and sheer volume of database workflows. Provenance extraction
from query event logs has been recently proposed as favorable because, in
principle, can result in meaningful provenance graphs for provenance
applications. Current approaches, however, (a) add substantial overhead to the
database and provenance extraction workflows and (b)~extract provenance that is
noisy, omits query execution dependencies, and is not rich enough for upstream
applications. To address these problems, we introduce OneProvenance: an
efficient provenance extraction system from query event logs. OneProvenance
addresses the unique challenges of log-based extraction by (a)~identifying
query execution dependencies through efficient log analysis, (b) extracting
provenance through novel event transformations that account for query
dependencies, and (c)~introducing effective filtering optimizations. Our
thorough experimental analysis shows that OneProvenance can improve extraction
by up to ~18X compared to state-of-the-art baselines; our optimizations reduce
the extraction noise and optimize performance even further. OneProvenance is
deployed at scale by Microsoft Purview and actively supports customer
provenance extraction needs (https://bit.ly/3N2JVGF).

					<dc:description>  Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous
content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that
there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in
security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared
interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable
steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure
is perfectly secure under \citet{cachin_perfect}'s information theoretic-model
of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we
show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally
efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These
insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography
algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency;
additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical
validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three
modern baselines -- arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping --
using GPT-2 and WaveRNN as communication channels. We find that the minimum
entropy coupling-based approach yields superior encoding efficiency, despite
its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it
may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of
minimum entropy coupling.

					<dc:description>  The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) graph is a recently
introduced random graph model with community structure and power-law
distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs
with similar properties as the well-known LFR one, and its main parameter can
be tuned to mimic its counterpart in the LFR model, the mixing parameter. In
this paper, we introduce hypergraph counterpart of the ABCD model, h-ABCD,
which produces random hypergraph with distributions of ground-truth community
sizes and degrees following power-law. As in the original ABCD, the new model
h-ABCD can produce hypergraphs with various levels of noise. More importantly,
the model is flexible and can mimic any desired level of homogeneity of
hyperedges that fall into one community. As a result, it can be used as a
suitable, synthetic playground for analyzing and tuning hypergraph community
detection algorithms.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Yang et al. (2023) recently addressed the open problem of solving Variational
Inequalities (VIs) with equality and inequality constraints through a
first-order gradient method. However, the proposed primal-dual method called
ACVI is applicable when we can compute analytic solutions of its subproblems;
thus, the general case remains an open problem. In this paper, we adopt a
warm-starting technique where we solve the subproblems approximately at each
iteration and initialize the variables with the approximate solution found at
the previous iteration. We prove its convergence and show that the gap function
of the last iterate of this inexact-ACVI method decreases at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ when the operator is $L$-Lipschitz and
monotone, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates.
Interestingly, we show that often in numerical experiments, this technique
converges faster than its exact counterpart. Furthermore, for the cases when
the inequality constraints are simple, we propose a variant of ACVI named
P-ACVI and prove its convergence for the same setting. We further demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed methods through numerous experiments. We also
relax the assumptions in Yang et al., yielding, to our knowledge, the first
convergence result that does not rely on the assumption that the operator is
$L$-Lipschitz. Our source code is provided at
$\texttt{https://github.com/mpagli/Revisiting-ACVI}$.

					<dc:description>  Predictive coding has emerged as an influential normative model of neural
computation, with numerous extensions and applications. As such, much effort
has been put into mapping PC faithfully onto the cortex, but there are issues
that remain unresolved or controversial. In particular, current implementations
often involve separate value and error neurons and require symmetric forward
and backward weights across different brain regions. These features have not
been experimentally confirmed. In this work, we show that the PC framework in
the linear regime can be modified to map faithfully onto the cortical hierarchy
in a manner compatible with empirical observations. By employing a
disentangling-inspired constraint on hidden-layer neural activities, we derive
an upper bound for the PC objective. Optimization of this upper bound leads to
an algorithm that shows the same performance as the original objective and maps
onto a biologically plausible network. The units of this network can be
interpreted as multi-compartmental neurons with non-Hebbian learning rules,
with a remarkable resemblance to recent experimental findings. There exist
prior models which also capture these features, but they are phenomenological,
while our work is a normative derivation. The network we derive does not
involve one-to-one connectivity or signal multiplexing, which the
phenomenological models required, indicating that these features are not
necessary for learning in the cortex. The normative nature of our algorithm in
the simplified linear case allows us to prove interesting properties of the
framework and analytically understand the computational role of our network's
components. The parameters of our network have natural interpretations as
physiological quantities in a multi-compartmental model of pyramidal neurons,
providing a concrete link between PC and experimental measurements carried out
in the cortex.

					<dc:description>  One-shot coreset selection aims to select a representative subset of the
training data, given a pruning rate, that can later be used to train future
models while retaining high accuracy. State-of-the-art coreset selection
methods pick the highest importance examples based on an importance metric and
are found to perform well at low pruning rates. However, at high pruning rates,
they suffer from a catastrophic accuracy drop, performing worse than even
random sampling. This paper explores the reasons behind this accuracy drop both
theoretically and empirically. We first propose a novel metric to measure the
coverage of a dataset on a specific distribution by extending the classical
geometric set cover problem to a distribution cover problem. This metric helps
explain why coresets selected by SOTA methods at high pruning rates perform
poorly compared to random sampling because of worse data coverage. We then
propose a novel one-shot coreset selection method, Coverage-centric Coreset
Selection (CCS), that jointly considers overall data coverage upon a
distribution as well as the importance of each example. We evaluate CCS on five
datasets and show that, at high pruning rates (e.g., 90%), it achieves
significantly better accuracy than previous SOTA methods (e.g., at least 19.56%
higher on CIFAR10) as well as random selection (e.g., 7.04% higher on CIFAR10)
and comparable accuracy at low pruning rates. We make our code publicly

					<dc:description>  In this work, we present a dense tracking and mapping system named
Vox-Fusion, which seamlessly fuses neural implicit representations with
traditional volumetric fusion methods. Our approach is inspired by the recently
developed implicit mapping and positioning system and further extends the idea
so that it can be freely applied to practical scenarios. Specifically, we
leverage a voxel-based neural implicit surface representation to encode and
optimize the scene inside each voxel. Furthermore, we adopt an octree-based
structure to divide the scene and support dynamic expansion, enabling our
system to track and map arbitrary scenes without knowing the environment like
in previous works. Moreover, we proposed a high-performance multi-process
framework to speed up the method, thus supporting some applications that
require real-time performance. The evaluation results show that our methods can
achieve better accuracy and completeness than previous methods. We also show
that our Vox-Fusion can be used in augmented reality and virtual reality
applications. Our source code is publicly available at

					<dc:description>  This paper studies the stability of weak dispersive shock profiles for a
quantum hydrodynamics system in one space dimension with nonlinear viscosity
and dispersive (quantum) effects due to a Bohm potential. It is shown that, if
the shock amplitude is sufficiently small, then the profiles are spectrally
stable. This analytical result is consistent with numerical estimations of the
location of the spectrum (Lattanzio, Zhelyazov, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci.
31, 2021). The proof is based on energy estimates at the spectral level, on the
choice of an appropriate weighted energy function for the perturbations
involving both the dispersive potential and the nonlinear viscosity, and on the
montonicity of the dispersive profiles in the small-amplitude regime.

					<dc:description>  As part of the second phase of Advanced Virgo upgrade program, instrumented
baffles are being constructed to be installed around the end mirrors in the
main arms, in continuation of what has been implemented for the input mode
cleaner end mirror during phase I. These baffles will be equipped with
photosensors, allowing for real-time monitoring of the stray light around the
mirrors. In this paper, we present optical simulations of the light
distribution in the detector main cavities to assess the ability of the sensors
to effectively monitor misalignment and defects on the mirrors surface and to
play a role in the pre-alignment of the interferometer.

					<dc:description>  Phonons offer the possibility to connect the microwave and optical domains
while being efficiently transduced with electronic and optical signals. Here,
we present a multimodal optomechanical platform, consisting of a
mechanical-optical-mechanical resonator configuration. The mechanical modes,
with frequencies at 265 MHz and 6.8 GHz, can be simultaneously excited into a
phonon lasing regime as supported by a stability analysis of the system. Both
the MHz and the GHz modes enter a self-sustained oscillation regime, leading to
the intermodulation of two frequency combs in the optical field. We
characterize this platform experimentally, demonstrating previously unexplored
dynamical regimes. These results suggest the possibility to control multiple
mechanical degrees of freedom via a single optical mode, with implications in
GHz phononic devices, signal processing, and optical comb sensing applications.

					<dc:description>  Recently, the so-called ``consistent thermodynamics'' of the Lorentzian
Reissner-Nordstr\&quot;{o}m (RN)-NUT-AdS$_4$ spacetimes has been pursued by a lot of
efforts via different means. Among these attempts, we had proposed a novel idea
that ``The NUT charge is a thermodynamical multi-hair&quot; to successfully tackle
with the subject. In this paper, we will adopt this strategy to reconsider the
mass formulae of the RN-NUT-AdS$_4$ solutions but written in an alternative
form, which had not been studied before in any existing literatures and could
be a most appropriate ansatz for the higher dimensional multiply NUTty-charged
AdS spacetimes without any constraint condition. Here, we shall discuss two
different possible cases for the Christodoulou-Ruffini-like squared-mass
formula and the first law as well as the Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula by
considering two different choices for the secondary hair: $J_n = Mn$ and $J_N =
MN$, respectively. For the sake of generality, we have introduced a
dimensionless constant $w$ into the constant factor $\Xi$ in the solution
expression so that when $w = 1$, all obtained results can reproduce those ones
delivered in our previous work.

					<dc:description>  Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very
close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought
general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole
and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show
that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which
stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar
orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly
turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the
black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the
infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises
rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a
few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole
mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature
$\sim (1-2)\times 10^{6}$ K ($\sim 100-200$ eV). The debris evolution and
observational features of eTDEs are qualitatively different from ordinary TDEs,
making eTDEs a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for
lower-mass black holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes
are extreme. Their detection offers a view of an exotic relativistic phenomenon
previously inaccessible.

					<dc:description>  We show how factoring the RNN-T's output distribution can significantly
reduce the computation cost and power consumption for on-device ASR inference
with no loss in accuracy. With the rise in popularity of neural-transducer type
models like the RNN-T for on-device ASR, optimizing RNN-T's runtime efficiency
is of great interest. While previous work has primarily focused on the
optimization of RNN-T's acoustic encoder and predictor, this paper focuses the
attention on the joiner. We show that despite being only a small part of RNN-T,
the joiner has a large impact on the overall model's runtime efficiency. We
propose to utilize HAT-style joiner factorization for the purpose of skipping
the more expensive non-blank computation when the blank probability exceeds a
certain threshold. Since the blank probability can be computed very efficiently
and the RNN-T output is dominated by blanks, our proposed method leads to a
26-30% decoding speed-up and 43-53% reduction in on-device power consumption,
all the while incurring no accuracy degradation and being relatively simple to
implement.

					<dc:description>  We compare numerical relativity (NR) data on the scattering of equal-mass,
non-spinning binary black holes to various analytical predictions based on
post-Minkowskian (PM) results. While the usual sequence of PM-expanded
scattering angles shows a rather poor convergence towards NR data, we find that
a reformulation of PM information in terms of Effective-One-Body radial
potentials leads to remarkable agreement with NR data, especially when using
the radiation-reacted 4PM information. Using Firsov's inversion formula we
directly extract, for the first time, from NR simulations a (radiation-reacted)
gravitational potential describing the scattering of equal-mass, non-spinning
binary black holes. We urge the NR community to compute more sequences of
scattering simulations, so as to extend this knowledge to a wider region of
parameter space.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoor
adversaries intend to maliciously control the predictions of attacked DNNs by
injecting hidden backdoors that can be activated by adversary-specified trigger
patterns during the training process. One recent research revealed that most of
the existing attacks failed in the real physical world since the trigger
contained in the digitized test samples may be different from that of the one
used for training. Accordingly, users can adopt spatial transformations as the
image pre-processing to deactivate hidden backdoors. In this paper, we explore
the previous findings from another side. We exploit classical spatial
transformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as
trigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor
attack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the
embedded backdoor of attacked DNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted,
verifying the effectiveness of our attack under both digital and physical
settings and its resistance to existing backdoor defenses.

					<dc:description>  Single-photon atom gradiometry is a powerful experimental technique that can
be employed to search for the oscillation of atomic transition energies induced
by ultralight scalar dark matter (ULDM). In the sub-Hz regime the background is
expected to be dominated by gravity gradient noise (GGN), which arises as a
result of mass fluctuations around the experiment. In this work we model the
GGN as surface Rayleigh waves, and we construct a likelihood-based analysis
that consistently folds GGN into the sensitivity estimates of vertical atom
gradiometers in the frequency window between 1 mHz and 1 Hz. We show that in
certain geological settings GGN can be significantly mitigated when operating a
multigradiometer configuration, which consists of three or more atom
interferometers in the same baseline. Multigradiometer experiments, such as
future versions of AION and MAGIS-100, have the potential to probe regions of
scalar ULDM parameter space in the sub-Hz regime that have not been excluded by
existing experiments.

					<dc:description>  Imagine you are managing a football team and have a fixed budget for
salaries. Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated this
question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league
football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several
seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest
scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then
investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across
nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the
budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our results
indicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.

					<dc:description>  Recent research has demonstrated the capability of behavior signals captured
by smartphones and wearables for longitudinal behavior modeling. However, there
is a lack of a comprehensive public dataset that serves as an open testbed for
fair comparison among algorithms. Moreover, prior studies mainly evaluate
algorithms using data from a single population within a short period, without
measuring the cross-dataset generalizability of these algorithms. We present
the first multi-year passive sensing datasets, containing over 700 user-years
and 497 unique users' data collected from mobile and wearable sensors, together
with a wide range of well-being metrics. Our datasets can support multiple
cross-dataset evaluations of behavior modeling algorithms' generalizability
across different users and years. As a starting point, we provide the benchmark
results of 18 algorithms on the task of depression detection. Our results
indicate that both prior depression detection algorithms and domain
generalization techniques show potential but need further research to achieve
adequate cross-dataset generalizability. We envision our multi-year datasets
can support the ML community in developing generalizable longitudinal behavior
modeling algorithms.

					<dc:description>  We introduce and benchmark a systematically improvable route for
excited-state calculations, state-specific configuration interaction
($\Delta$CI), \alert{which is a particular realization of multiconfigurational
self-consistent field and multireference configuration interaction.} Starting
with a reference built from optimized configuration state functions, separate
CI calculations are performed for each targeted state (hence state-specific
orbitals and determinants). Accounting for single and double excitations
produces the $\Delta$CISD model, which can be improved with second-order
Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory ($\Delta$CISD+EN2) or a posteriori Davidson
corrections ($\Delta$CISD+Q). These models were gauged against a vast and
diverse set of 294 reference excitation energies. We have found that $\Delta$CI
is significantly more accurate than standard ground-state-based CI, whereas
close performances were found between $\Delta$CISD and EOM-CC2, and between
$\Delta$CISD+EN2 and EOM-CCSD. For larger systems, $\Delta$CISD+Q delivers more
accurate results than EOM-CC2 and EOM-CCSD. The $\Delta$CI route can handle
challenging multireference problems, singly- and doubly-excited states, from
closed- and open-shell species, with overall comparable accuracy, and thus
represents a promising alternative to more established methodologies. In its
current form, however, it is only reliable for relatively low-lying excited
states.

					<dc:description>  Phase transition is a core content of black hole thermodynamics. This study
adopted the Kramer's escape rate method for describing the Brownian motion of
particles in an external field to investigate the intensity of the phase
transition between small and large black hole states. Some existing studies
mostly focused on the formal analysis of the thermodynamic phase transition of
black holes, but they neglected the detailed description of the phase
transition process. Our results show that the phase transition between small
and large black holes for charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes presents
serious asymmetric features, and the overall process is dominated by the
transition from a small black hole to a large black hole. This study filled a
research gap of a stochastic process analysis on the issue of the first-order
phase transition rate in the AdS black hole.

					<dc:description>  Gravitational atoms produced from the superradiant extraction of rotational
energy of spinning black holes can reach energy densities significantly higher
than that of dark matter, turning black holes into powerful potential detectors
for ultralight bosons. These structures are formed by coherently oscillating
bosons, which induce oscillating metric perturbations deflecting photon
geodesics passing through their interior. The deviation of nearby geodesics can
be further amplified near critical bound photon orbits. We discuss the prospect
of detecting this deflection using photon ring autocorrelations with the Event
Horizon Telescope and its next-generation upgrade, which can probe a large
unexplored region of the cloud mass parameter space when compared with previous
constraints.

					<dc:description>  Approximate integer programming is the following: For a convex body $K
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, either determine whether $K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ is
empty, or find an integer point in the convex body scaled by $2$ from its
center of gravity $c$. Approximate integer programming can be solved in time
$2^{O(n)}$ while the fastest known methods for exact integer programming run in
time $2^{O(n)} \cdot n^n$. So far, there are no efficient methods for integer
programming known that are based on approximate integer programming. Our main
contribution are two such methods, each yielding novel complexity results.
  First, we show that an integer point $x^* \in (K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n)$ can be
found in time $2^{O(n)}$, provided that the remainders of each component $x_i^*
\mod{\ell}$ for some arbitrarily fixed $\ell \geq 5(n+1)$ of $x^*$ are given.
The algorithm is based on a cutting-plane technique, iteratively halving the
volume of the feasible set. The cutting planes are determined via approximate
integer programming. Enumeration of the possible remainders gives a
$2^{O(n)}n^n$ algorithm for general integer programming. This matches the
current best bound of an algorithm by Dadush (2012) that is considerably more
involved. Our algorithm also relies on a new asymmetric approximate
Carath\'eodory theorem that might be of interest on its own.
  Our second method concerns integer programming problems in equation-standard
form $Ax = b, 0 \leq x \leq u, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ . Such a problem can be
reduced to the solution of $\prod_i O(\log u_i +1)$ approximate integer
programming problems. This implies, for example that knapsack or subset-sum
problems with polynomial variable range $0 \leq x_i \leq p(n)$ can be solved in
time $(\log n)^{O(n)}$. For these problems, the best running time so far was
$n^n \cdot 2^{O(n)}$.

					<dc:description>  We consider the path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equation, in which both the
drift and the diffusion coefficients are allowed to depend on the whole
trajectory of the process up to the current time t, and depend on the
corresponding marginal distributions. We prove the strong well-posedness of the
equation in the L^p setting, p greater or equal than 2, locally in time, as
well as the propagation of chaos properties. Then, we introduce an interpolated
Euler scheme, a key object to simulate numerically the process, and we prove
the convergence, with an explicit rate, of this scheme towards the strong
solution in the L^p norm. As applications we give results for two mean-field
equations arising in biology and neuroscience.

					<dc:title>Proximal Gradient Methods Beyond Monotony</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>De Marchi, Alberto</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We address composite optimization problems, which consist in minimizing the
sum of a smooth and a merely lower semicontinuous function, without any
convexity assumptions. Numerical solutions of these problems can be obtained by
proximal gradient methods, which often rely on a line search procedure as
globalization mechanism. We consider an adaptive nonmonotone proximal gradient
scheme based on an averaged merit function and establish asymptotic convergence
guarantees under weak assumptions, delivering results on par with the monotone
strategy. Global worst-case rates for the iterates and a stationarity measure
are also derived. Finally, a numerical example indicates the potential of
nonmonotonicity and spectral approximations.

					<dc:description>  We propose methods to produce energetic meson beams such as charged and
neutral Kaons, which are boosted to be collimated and with relatively long life
time. The first type of methods is based on asymmetric electron positron
collisions with a center of mass energy of, e.g., 1020 MeV, and Kaons can be
produced at a rate of $10^{4-5}/s$. The electron and positron beams are either
asymmetric in energy, e.g., 10 GeV electron beam with 26 MeV positron beam, or
asymmetric in space, e.g., 10 GeV electron and positron beams collisions
separated with a angle around 0.05 radius. Such proposals should be able to be
achieved with a reasonable budget. The other type of method is relying on TeV
positron on target experiment, where Kaon beams can be achieved at around
$10^{7}$ per bunch crossing. Such Kaon beams are clean with small
contamination, and can have great physics potential on, e.g., hyperon searches
through Kaon nuclei collision, Kaon rare decay measurement, and Kaon proton or
Kaon lepton collisions. The same technique with very asymmetric electron
positron collisions can also be extended to other final states such as pions
and tau leptons.

					<dc:description>  Superconductivity and the normal-state properties of NbN films can be tuned
in a wide range, supplying a suitable platform to investigate the systematical
evolution of the superconducting performances. Herein, we report the upper
critical field of NbN films in both the vertical ($B\perp$ film) and parallel
($B\parallel$ film) orientations over a wide temperature range. Eight samples
with the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ ranging from 2.5 K to 9.8 K
are studied. Meanwhile, the normal-state resistivity is tuned by more than six
times by changing the conditions of the film growth. It is found that the
magnitudes of the upper critical field in both field directions
($B_{c2}^{\perp}$ and $B_{c2}^{\parallel}$) exceed the paramagnetic limiting
field $B_p$. The temperature dependent $B_{c2}^{\perp}$ can be described by the
extended Werthamer--Helfand--Hohenberg (WHH) model considering the Pauli spin
paramagnetism. Meanwhile, the $B_{c2}^{\parallel}$-$T$ data shows the feature
of two-dimensional superconductivity in the temperature range near $T_c$. The
evolution of the obtained Maki parameter with other parameters, such as the
slope of the upper critical field near $T_c$ and the normal-state resistivity,
are discussed to reveal the characteristics of the Pauli paramagnetic effect in
this system.

					<dc:description>  In Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), various pretext tasks are designed for
learning feature representations through contrastive loss. However, previous
studies have shown that this loss is less tolerant to semantically similar
samples due to the inherent defect of instance discrimination objectives, which
may harm the quality of learned feature embeddings used in downstream tasks. To
improve the discriminative ability of feature embeddings in SSL, we propose a
new loss function called Angular Contrastive Loss (ACL), a linear combination
of angular margin and contrastive loss. ACL improves contrastive learning by
explicitly adding an angular margin between positive and negative augmented
pairs in SSL. Experimental results show that using ACL for both supervised and
unsupervised learning significantly improves performance. We validated our new
loss function using the FSDnoisy18k dataset, where we achieved 73.6% and 77.1%
accuracy in sound event classification using supervised and self-supervised
learning, respectively.

					<dc:description>  Recent studies have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks during the training process. Specifically, the
adversaries intend to embed hidden backdoors in DNNs so that malicious model
predictions can be activated through pre-defined trigger patterns. In this
paper, we explore the backdoor mechanism from the angle of the model structure.
We select the skip connection for discussions, inspired by the understanding
that it helps the learning of model `shortcuts' where backdoor triggers are
usually easier to be learned. Specifically, we demonstrate that the attack
success rate (ASR) decreases significantly when reducing the outputs of some
key skip connections. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet
effective backdoor removal method by suppressing the skip connections in
critical layers selected by our method. We also implement fine-tuning on these
layers to recover high benign accuracy and to further reduce ASR. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.

					<dc:description>  Recent studies revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) are exposed to
backdoor threats when training with third-party resources (such as training
samples or backbones). The backdoored model has promising performance in
predicting benign samples, whereas its predictions can be maliciously
manipulated by adversaries based on activating its backdoors with pre-defined
trigger patterns. Currently, most of the existing backdoor attacks were
conducted on the image classification under the targeted manner. In this paper,
we reveal that these threats could also happen in object detection, posing
threatening risks to many mission-critical applications ($e.g.$, pedestrian
detection and intelligent surveillance systems). Specifically, we design a
simple yet effective poison-only backdoor attack in an untargeted manner, based
on task characteristics. We show that, once the backdoor is embedded into the
target model by our attack, it can trick the model to lose detection of any
object stamped with our trigger patterns. We conduct extensive experiments on
the benchmark dataset, showing its effectiveness in both digital and
physical-world settings and its resistance to potential defenses.

					<dc:description>  The linear and nonlinear characteristics of the electron cyclotron drift
instability (ECDI) have been studied through the particle-in-cell (PIC) and
continuum Vlasov simulation methods in connection with the effects of the
azimuthal length (in the $E \times B$ direction) on the simulations. Simulation
results for a long azimuthal length (17.82 cm $= 627\;v_d/\omega_{ce}$, where
$\omega_{ce}$ is the electron cyclotron frequency and $v_d$ is the $E\times B$
drift of the electrons) are reported, for which a high resolution is achieved
in Fourier space. For simulations with a long azimuthal length, the linear
growth rates of the PIC simulations show a considerable discrepancy with the
theory, whereas the linear growth rate of the Vlasov simulations remains close
to the theory. In the nonlinear regime, the inverse cascade is shown in both
PIC and Vlasov simulations with a sufficiently large azimuthal length. In
simulations with a short azimuthal length, however, the inverse cascade is
barely observed. Instead, the PIC simulations with a short azimuthal length
(0.5625 cm $=19.8\;v_d/\omega_{ce}$) show an essentially continuous nonlinear
dispersion, similar to what is predicted by the ion-sound turbulence theory. It
is shown that, in the PIC and Vlasov simulations, the inverse cascade coincides
with the formation and merging of electron structures in phase space. This
process, however, terminates differently in the PIC simulations compared with
the Vlasov simulations. Larger amplitudes of ECDI fluctuations are observed in
the PIC simulations compared with the Vlasov simulations, leading to an
intensified electron heating and anomalous current. This suggests that the
statistical noise of PIC simulations might contribute to the extreme electron
heating that has been observed in previous studies.

					<dc:description>  Collaborative autonomous multi-agent systems covering a specified area have
many potential applications, such as UAV search and rescue, forest fire
fighting, and real-time high-resolution monitoring. Traditional approaches for
such coverage problems involve designing a model-based control policy based on
sensor data. However, designing model-based controllers is challenging, and the
state-of-the-art classical control policy still exhibits a large degree of
sub-optimality. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)
approach for the multi-agent efficient domain coverage problem involving agents
with second-order dynamics. Our approach is based on the Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization Algorithm (MAPPO). Our proposed network architecture
includes the incorporation of LSTM and self-attention, which allows the trained
policy to adapt to a variable number of agents. Our trained policy
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art classical control policy. We
demonstrate our proposed method in a variety of simulated experiments.

					<dc:description>  Learning long-horizon tasks such as navigation has presented difficult
challenges for successfully applying reinforcement learning to robotics. From
another perspective, under known environments, sampling-based planning can
robustly find collision-free paths in environments without learning. In this
work, we propose Control Transformer that models return-conditioned sequences
from low-level policies guided by a sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)
planner. We demonstrate that our framework can solve long-horizon navigation
tasks using only local information. We evaluate our approach on
partially-observed maze navigation with MuJoCo robots, including Ant, Point,
and Humanoid. We show that Control Transformer can successfully navigate
through mazes and transfer to unknown environments. Additionally, we apply our
method to a differential drive robot (Turtlebot3) and show zero-shot sim2real
transfer under noisy observations.

					<dc:description>  We present the first implementation of spin-orbit coupling effects in fully
internally contracted second-order quasidegenerate N-electron valence
perturbation theory (SO-QDNEVPT2). The SO-QDNEVPT2 approach enables the
computations of ground- and excited-state energies and oscillator strengths
combining the description of static electron correlation with an efficient
treatment of dynamic correlation and spin-orbit coupling. In addition to
SO-QDNEVPT2 with the full description of one- and two-body spin-orbit
interactions at the level of two-component Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian, our
implementation also features a simplified approach that takes advantage of
spin-orbit mean-field approximation (SOMF-QDNEVPT2). The accuracy of these
methods is tested for the group 14 and 16 hydrides, 3d and 4d transition metal
ions, and two actinide dioxides (neptunyl and plutonyl dications). The
zero-field splittings of group 14 and 16 molecules computed using SO-QDNEVPT2
and SOMF-QDNEVPT2 are in a good agreement with the available experimental data.
For the 3d transition metal ions, the SO-QDNEVPT2 method is significantly more
accurate than SOMF-QDNEVPT2, while no substantial difference in the performance
of two methods is observed for the 4d ions. Finally, we demonstrate that for
the actinide dioxides the results of SO-QDNEVPT2 and SOMF-QDNEVPT2 are in a
good agreement with the data from previous theoretical studies of these
systems. Overall, our results demonstrate that SO-QDNEVPT2 and SOMF-QDNEVPT2
are promising multireference methods for treating spin-orbit coupling with a
relatively low computational cost.

					<dc:description>  Vision Transformer (ViT) is a pioneering deep learning framework that can
address real-world computer vision issues, such as image classification and
object recognition. Importantly, ViTs are proven to outperform traditional deep
learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Relatively
recently, a number of ViT mutations have been transplanted into the field of
medical imaging, thereby resolving a variety of critical classification and
segmentation challenges, especially in terms of brain imaging data. In this
work, we provide a novel multimodal deep learning pipeline, MultiCrossViT,
which is capable of analyzing both structural MRI (sMRI) and static functional
network connectivity (sFNC) data for the prediction of schizophrenia disease.
On a dataset with minimal training subjects, our novel model can achieve an AUC
of 0.832. Finally, we visualize multiple brain regions and covariance patterns
most relevant to schizophrenia based on the resulting ViT attention maps by
extracting features from transformer encoders.

					<dc:description>  Electric charge transport of hadronic matter at finite temperature and
magnetic field is studied within the linear sigma model. Anisotropic transport
coefficients associated with the charge transport are estimated both in the
weak and strong regimes of the magnetic field using the transport theory
approach. In a weakly magnetized medium, the magnetic field effects are
incorporated through the Lorentz force term in the Boltzmann equation. Strong
magnetic field puts further constraints on the motion of charged particles
through Landau quantization. Magnetic field-dependent thermal relaxation time
is obtained from interaction rates of hadrons with the S-matrix approach by
considering the Landau level kinematics of the charged hadrons. Mean-field
effects are embedded in the analysis through the temperature-dependent hadron
masses. Further, the hadronic medium response to a time-varying external
electric field is studied in weak and strong magnetic field regimes. It is seen
that electromagnetic responses of the hadronic matter have a strong dependence
on the mean-field effects, sigma mass, the strength of the external fields, and
its evolution in the medium.

					<dc:description>  Histological staining is the gold standard for tissue examination in clinical
pathology and life-science research, which visualizes the tissue and cellular
structures using chromatic dyes or fluorescence labels to aid the microscopic
assessment of tissue. However, the current histological staining workflow
requires tedious sample preparation steps, specialized laboratory
infrastructure, and trained histotechnologists, making it expensive,
time-consuming, and not accessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning
techniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by
digitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks,
providing rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical
staining methods. These techniques, broadly referred to as virtual staining,
were extensively explored by multiple research groups and demonstrated to be
successful in generating various types of histological stains from label-free
microscopic images of unstained samples; similar approaches were also used for
transforming images of an already stained tissue sample into another type of
stain, performing virtual stain-to-stain transformations. In this Review, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research advances in deep
learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques. The basic concepts
and the typical workflow of virtual staining are introduced, followed by a
discussion of representative works and their technical innovations. We also
share our perspectives on the future of this emerging field, aiming to inspire
readers from diverse scientific fields to further expand the scope of deep
learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques and their
applications.

					<dc:description>  Popular industrial robotic problems such as spray painting and welding
require (i) conditioning on free-shape 3D objects and (ii) planning of multiple
trajectories to solve the task. Yet, existing solutions make strong assumptions
on the form of input surfaces and the nature of output paths, resulting in
limited approaches unable to cope with real-data variability. By leveraging on
recent advances in 3D deep learning, we introduce a novel framework capable of
dealing with arbitrary 3D surfaces, and handling a variable number of unordered
output paths (i.e. unstructured). Our approach focuses on predicting smaller
path segments, which can be later concatenated to reconstruct long-horizon
paths. We extensively validate the proposed method in the context of robotic
spray painting by releasing PaintNet, the first public dataset of expert
demonstrations on free-shape 3D objects collected in a real industrial
scenario. A thorough experimental analysis demonstrates the capabilities of our
model to promptly predict smooth output paths that cover up to 95% of the
surface of previously unseen object instances. Furthermore, we show how models
learned from PaintNet capture relevant features which serve as a reliable
starting point to improve data and time efficiency when dealing with new object
categories.

					<dc:title>Solvable random matrix ensemble with a logarithmic weakly confining

					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This work identifies a solvable (in the sense that spectral correlation
functions can be expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials), rotationally
invariant random matrix ensemble with a logarithmic weakly confining potential.
The ensemble, which can be interpreted as a transformed Jacobi ensemble, is in
the thermodynamic limit characterized by a Lorentzian eigenvalue density. It is
shown that spectral correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the
nonclassical Gegenbauer polynomials $C_n^{(-1/2)}(x)$ with $n \ge 2$, which
have been proven to form a complete orthogonal set with respect to the proper
weight function. A procedure to sample matrices from the ensemble is outlined
and used to provide a numerical verification for some of the analytical
results. This ensemble is pointed out to potentially have applications in
quantum many-body physics.

					<dc:description>  We describe the SNAD Viewer, a web portal for astronomers which presents a
centralized view of individual objects from the Zwicky Transient Facility's
(ZTF) data releases, including data gathered from multiple publicly available
astronomical archives and data sources. Initially built to enable efficient
expert feedback in the context of adaptive machine learning applications, it
has evolved into a full-fledged community asset that centralizes public
information and provides a multi-dimensional view of ZTF sources. For users, we
provide detailed descriptions of the data sources and choices underlying the
information displayed in the portal. For developers, we describe our
architectural choices and their consequences such that our experience can help
others engaged in similar endeavors or in adapting our publicly released code
to their requirements. The infrastructure we describe here is scalable and
flexible and can be personalized and used by other surveys and for other
science goals. The Viewer has been instrumental in highlighting the crucial
roles domain experts retain in the era of big data in astronomy. Given the
arrival of the upcoming generation of large-scale surveys, we believe similar
systems will be paramount in enabling an optimal exploitation of the scientific
potential enclosed in current terabyte and future petabyte-scale data sets. The
Viewer is publicly available online at https://ztf.snad.space

					<dc:description>  Out-of-distribution detection is crucial to the safe deployment of machine
learning systems. Currently, unsupervised out-of-distribution detection is
dominated by generative-based approaches that make use of estimates of the
likelihood or other measurements from a generative model. Reconstruction-based
methods offer an alternative approach, in which a measure of reconstruction
error is used to determine if a sample is out-of-distribution. However,
reconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful
tuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent
dimension - to produce good results. In this work, we exploit the view of
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as denoising autoencoders where
the bottleneck is controlled externally, by means of the amount of noise
applied. We propose to use DDPMs to reconstruct an input that has been noised
to a range of noise levels, and use the resulting multi-dimensional
reconstruction error to classify out-of-distribution inputs. We validate our
approach both on standard computer-vision datasets and on higher dimension
medical datasets. Our approach outperforms not only reconstruction-based
methods, but also state-of-the-art generative-based approaches.

					<dc:description>  Massively parallel Fourier transforms are widely used in computational
sciences, and specifically in computational fluid dynamics which involves
unbounded Poisson problems. In practice the latter is usually the most
time-consuming operation due to its inescapable all-to-all communication
pattern. The original flups library tackles that issue with an implementation
of the distributed Fourier transform tailor-made for successive resolutions of
unbounded Poisson problems. However the proposed implementation lacks of
flexibility as it only supports cell-centered data layout and features a plain
communication strategy. This work extends the library along two directions.
First, flups implementation is generalized to support a node-centered data
layout. Second, three distinct approaches are provided to handle the
communications: one all-to-all, and two non-blocking implementations relying on
manual packing and MPI_Datatype to communicate over the network. The proposed
software is validated against analytical solutions for unbounded,
semi-unbounded, and periodic domains. The performance of the approaches is then
compared against accFFT, another distributed FFT implementation, using a
periodic case. Finally the performance metrics of each implementation are
analyzed and detailed on various top-tier European facilities up to 49,152
cores. This work brings flups up to a fully production-ready and performant
distributed FFT library, featuring all the possible types of FFTs and with
flexibility in the data-layout. The code is available under a BSD-3 license at
github.com/vortexlab-uclouvain/flups.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose a new dynamic average consensus algorithm that is robust to
information-sharing noise arising from differential-privacy design. Not only is
dynamic average consensus widely used in cooperative control and distributed
tracking, it is also a fundamental building block in numerous distributed
computation algorithms such as multi-agent optimization and distributed Nash
equilibrium seeking. We propose a new dynamic average consensus algorithm that
is robust to persistent and independent information-sharing noise added for the
purpose of differential-privacy protection. In fact, the algorithm can ensure
both provable convergence to the exact average reference signal and rigorous
epsilon-differential privacy (even when the number of iterations tends to
infinity), which, to our knowledge, has not been achieved before in average
consensus algorithms. Given that channel noise in communication can be viewed
as a special case of differential-privacy noise, the algorithm can also be used
to counteract communication imperfections. Numerical simulation results confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  functional theory using a low rank approximation of the dielectric matrix</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Materials Science</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Computational Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We present an efficient preconditioning technique for accelerating the fixed
point iteration in real-space Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The preconditioner uses a low rank approximation of the
dielectric matrix (LRDM) based on G\^ateaux derivatives of the residual of
fixed point iteration along appropriately chosen direction functions. We
develop a computationally efficient method to evaluate these G\^ateaux
derivatives in conjunction with the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration
procedure, an approach widely used in large-scale Kohn-Sham DFT calculations.
Further, we propose a variant of LRDM preconditioner based on adaptive
accumulation of low-rank approximations from previous SCF iterations, and also
extend the LRDM preconditioner to spin-polarized Kohn-Sham DFT calculations. We
demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the LRDM preconditioner against
other widely used preconditioners on a range of benchmark systems with sizes
ranging from $\sim$ 100-1100 atoms ($\sim$ 500--20,000 electrons). The
benchmark systems include various combinations of
metal-insulating-semiconducting heterogeneous material systems, nanoparticles
with localized $d$ orbitals near the Fermi energy, nanofilm with metal dopants,
and magnetic systems. In all benchmark systems, the LRDM preconditioner
converges robustly within 20--30 iterations. In contrast, other widely used
preconditioners show slow convergence in many cases, as well as divergence of
the fixed point iteration in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate the
computational efficiency afforded by the LRDM method, with up to 3.4$\times$
reduction in computational cost for the total ground-state calculation compared
to other preconditioners.

					<dc:description>  With the wide and deep adoption of deep learning models in real applications,
there is an increasing need to model and learn the representations of the
neural networks themselves. These models can be used to estimate attributes of
different neural network architectures such as the accuracy and latency,
without running the actual training or inference tasks. In this paper, we
propose a neural architecture representation model that can be used to estimate
these attributes holistically. Specifically, we first propose a simple and
effective tokenizer to encode both the operation and topology information of a
neural network into a single sequence. Then, we design a multi-stage fusion
transformer to build a compact vector representation from the converted
sequence. For efficient model training, we further propose an information flow
consistency augmentation and correspondingly design an architecture consistency
loss, which brings more benefits with less augmentation samples compared with
previous random augmentation strategies. Experiment results on NAS-Bench-101,
NAS-Bench-201, DARTS search space and NNLQP show that our proposed framework
can be used to predict the aforementioned latency and accuracy attributes of
both cell architectures and whole deep neural networks, and achieves promising
performance.

					<dc:description>  Testing the quantum nature of gravity in a laboratory via entanglement
requires us to create a massive spatial quantum superposition, i.e. the
Schr\&quot;odinger cat state, where the mass and the superposition ought to be
around $10^{-15}-10^{-14}$ kg and $\Delta x \sim 10-100~\mu {\rm m}$. Creating
such a massive spatial quantum superposition poses incredible challenges. The
methods employed so far rely either on wavepacket expansion or on a quantum
ancilla, e.g. single spin dependent forces, which scale inversely with mass. In
this paper, we will show that gravitational acceleration along with the
diamagnetic repulsion can achieve a complete ``release'' and ``catch''
interferometry in the course of which a large spatial superposition is
generated in a relatively short time. After first creating a modest initial
spatial superposition $1~\mu {\rm m}$ (e.g. using Stern-Gerlach), we will show
that we can achieve an $\sim 10^{3}$ fold improvement to the spatial
superposition size ($1~{\rm \mu m}\rightarrow 980~\mu {\rm m}$) between the
wave packets in less than $0.02$ s by using the Earth's gravitational
acceleration and then the diamagnetic repulsive scattering of the nanocrystal,
neither of which depend on the object mass. Finally, the wave packet
trajectories can be closed so that spatial interference fringes can be observed
or spin coherence can be further recovered using the SG apparatus.

					<dc:description>  Conventional synchronous generators are gradually being replaced by
inverter-based resources, such transition introduces more complicated operation
conditions. And the reduction in system inertia imposes challenges for system
operators on maintaining system rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) security.
This paper presents a selectively linearized neural network (SNLNN) based
RoCoF-constrained unit commitment (SLNN-RCUC) model. A RoCoF predictor is first
trained to predict the system wide highest locational RoCoF based on a
high-fidelity simulation dataset. Instead of incorporating the complete neural
network into unit commitment, a ReLU linearization method is implemented on
active selected neurons to improve the algorithm computational efficiency. The
effectiveness of proposed SLNN-RCUC model is demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus
system by conducting time domain simulation on PSS/E

					<dc:description>  We study the dissipative dynamics of a one-dimensional bosonic system
described in terms of the bipartite Bose-Hubbard model with alternating gain
and loss. This model exhibits the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry under some specific
conditions and features a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition. It is
characterized by an order parameter corresponding to the population imbalance
between even and odd sites, similar to the continuous phase transitions in the
Hermitian realm. In the noninteracting limit, we solve the problem exactly and
compute the parameter dependence of the order parameter. The interacting limit
is addressed at the mean-field level, which allows us to construct the phase
diagram for the model. We find that both the interaction and dissipation rates
induce a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. On the other hand, periodic
modulation of the dissipative coupling in time stabilizes the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime. Our findings are corroborated numerically on a
tight-binding chain with gain and loss.

					<dc:description>  Feature matching is crucial in visual localization, where 2D-3D
correspondence plays a major role in determining the accuracy of camera pose. A
sufficient number of well-distributed 2D-3D correspondences is essential for
accurate pose estimation due to noise. However, existing 2D-3D feature matching
methods rely on finding nearest neighbors in the feature space and removing
outliers using hand-crafted heuristics, which may lead to potential matches
being missed or the correct matches being filtered out. In this work, we
propose a novel method called Geometry-Aided Matching (GAM), which incorporates
both appearance information and geometric context to address this issue and to
improve 2D-3D feature matching. GAM can greatly boost the recall of 2D-3D
matches while maintaining high precision. We apply GAM to a new hierarchical
visual localization pipeline and show that GAM can effectively improve the
robustness and accuracy of localization. Extensive experiments show that GAM
can find more real matches than hand-crafted heuristics and learning baselines.
Our proposed localization method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple
visual localization datasets. Experiments on Cambridge Landmarks dataset show
that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and is six
times faster than the top-performed method. The source code is available at

					<dc:description>  Quantum computing is a game-changing technology for global academia, research
centers and industries including computational science, mathematics, finance,
pharmaceutical, materials science, chemistry and cryptography. Although it has
seen a major boost in the last decade, we are still a long way from reaching
the maturity of a full-fledged quantum computer. That said, we will be in the
Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for a long time, working on dozens
or even thousands of qubits quantum computing systems. An outstanding
challenge, then, is to come up with an application that can reliably carry out
a nontrivial task of interest on the near-term quantum devices with
non-negligible quantum noise. To address this challenge, several near-term
quantum computing techniques, including variational quantum algorithms, error
mitigation, quantum circuit compilation and benchmarking protocols, have been
proposed to characterize and mitigate errors, and to implement algorithms with
a certain resistance to noise, so as to enhance the capabilities of near-term
quantum devices and explore the boundaries of their ability to realize useful
applications. Besides, the development of near-term quantum devices is
inseparable from the efficient classical simulation, which plays a vital role
in quantum algorithm design and verification, error-tolerant verification and
other applications. This review will provide a thorough introduction of these
near-term quantum computing techniques, report on their progress, and finally
discuss the future prospect of these techniques, which we hope will motivate
researchers to undertake additional studies in this field.

					<dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning a linear operator $\theta$ between two
Hilbert spaces from empirical observations, which we interpret as least squares
regression in infinite dimensions. We show that this goal can be reformulated
as an inverse problem for $\theta$ with the undesirable feature that its
forward operator is generally non-compact (even if $\theta$ is assumed to be
compact or of $p$-Schatten class). However, we prove that, in terms of spectral
properties and regularisation theory, this inverse problem is equivalent to the
known compact inverse problem associated with scalar response regression. Our
framework allows for the elegant derivation of dimension-free rates for generic
learning algorithms under H\&quot;older-type source conditions. The proofs rely on
the combination of techniques from kernel regression with recent results on
concentration of measure for sub-exponential Hilbertian random variables. The
obtained rates hold for a variety of practically-relevant scenarios in
functional regression as well as nonlinear regression with operator-valued
kernels and match those of classical kernel regression with scalar response.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we investigated the theoretical and cosmological effects of
the matter Lagrangian degeneracy in an extension of the Symmetric Teleparallel
Equivalent of General Relativity, denoted as $f (Q, T )$ gravity. This
degeneracy comes from the fact that both $\mathcal{L}_m = p$ and $\mathcal{L}_m
= -\rho$ can give rise to the stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid. The
$f(Q,T)$ equations depend on the form of the matter Lagrangian and hence they
also have a degeneracy that has influence on the density evolution of dust
matter and radiation, on the form of the generalized Friedmann equations and
also shows changes in the cosmological parameters confidence regions when
performing Monte Carlo Markov Chains analyses. Our results suggest that since
changing the matter Lagrangian causes different theoretical and cosmological
results, future studies in $f(Q,T)$ gravity should consider both forms of the
matter Lagrangians to account for the different mathematical and observational
results.

					<dc:description>  We have evaluated the data-efficient Bayesian optimization method for the
specific task of injection tuning in a circular accelerator. In this paper, we
describe the implementation of this method at the Karlsruhe Research
Accelerator with up to nine tuning parameters, including the determination of
the associated hyperparameters. We show that the Bayesian optimization method
outperforms manual tuning and the commonly used Nelder-Mead optimization
algorithm both in simulation and experiment. The algorithm was also
successfully used to ease the commissioning phase after the installation of new
injection magnets and is regularly used during accelerator operations. We
demonstrate that the introduction of context variables that include intra-bunch
scattering effects, such as the Touschek effect, further improves the control
and robustness of the injection process.

					<dc:description>  Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) with masses $\mathcal{O}(0.1 -
1\,\,\text{GeV}/c^{2})$ are promising candidates for the simultaneous
explanation of the smallness of the observed neutrino masses as well as the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the observable Universe. These particles can be
produced in the decay of hadrons typically produced in a neutrino beamline used
for oscillation experiments, and have sufficient lifetime to propagate to a
near detector, where they decay to observable particles. For the approximation
of a single new mass eigenstate mixing with the Standard Model via the lepton
mixing matrix, a simulation framework based on the GENIE event generator has
been developed. This module is designed to facilitate searches for HNL through
a unified, minimal interface employing a detailed treatment of the kinematics
and dynamics of massive unstable neutrinos, with a transparently organised
suite of physics effects tracking the HNL from its production to its decay.
These mechanisms are expounded on in the current work, underlining the rich
landscape for novel, non-trivial physics that has already been identified in
previous literature. This framework is an ongoing effort to provide a
consistent and comprehensive description of heavy neutrinos from particle
decays. We highlight use cases and future applications of interest to the
accelerator neutrino community.

					<dc:description>  End-to-end text spotting aims to integrate scene text detection and
recognition into a unified framework. Dealing with the relationship between the
two sub-tasks plays a pivotal role in designing effective spotters. Although
Transformer-based methods eliminate the heuristic post-processing, they still
suffer from the synergy issue between the sub-tasks and low training
efficiency. In this paper, we present DeepSolo, a simple DETR-like baseline
that lets a single Decoder with Explicit Points Solo for text detection and
recognition simultaneously. Technically, for each text instance, we represent
the character sequence as ordered points and model them with learnable explicit
point queries. After passing a single decoder, the point queries have encoded
requisite text semantics and locations, thus can be further decoded to the
center line, boundary, script, and confidence of text via very simple
prediction heads in parallel. Besides, we also introduce a text-matching
criterion to deliver more accurate supervisory signals, thus enabling more
efficient training. Quantitative experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that DeepSolo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and achieves better
training efficiency. In addition, DeepSolo is also compatible with line
annotations, which require much less annotation cost than polygons. The code is
available at https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/DeepSolo.

					<dc:description>  In the framework of the MSSM extension with local gauged baryon and lepton
numbers (BLMSSM), we calculate the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment (MDM)
and lepton $(e, \mu, \tau)$ electric dipole moment (EDM), and discuss how the
muon MDM and lepton EDM depend on the parameters within the mass insertion
approximation. Among many parameters, $\tan{\beta}$,~$g_L$,~$m_L$ and $\mu_H$
are more sensitive parameters for $a^{BL}_{\mu}$. Considering the experimental
limitations, our best numerical result of $a^{BL}_{\mu}$ is around $2.5 \times
10^{-9}$, which can well compensate the departure between the experiment data
and Standard Model (SM) prediction. The CP violating phases in BLMSSM are more
than those in the MSSM, including new parameters $\theta_{\mu_L}$ and
$\theta_{L}$. They can give large contributions, which play an important role
in exploring the source of CP violation and probing new physics beyond SM.

					<dc:description>  We present an ab initio study of the nonsequential strong-field ionization
dynamics of a model two-electron atom with helium character. Single- and
double-ionization events are characterized and displayed using detector signals
extracted at different points in the two-electron two-dimensional space. The
double photoelectron momentum distribution is calculated via coherent
path-summation over virtual particle trajectories. Insights into different
ionization and electron recollision pathways are gained from detailed
virtual-particle tracking and energy-time readouts. This study demonstrates the
extension of virtual detector theory to strong-field multi-electron quantum
dynamics and highlights the importance of the evolving quantum phase in
quasi-classical electron propagation.

					<dc:description>  Micro-expressions have drawn increasing interest lately due to various
potential applications. The task is, however, difficult as it incorporates many
challenges from the fields of computer vision, machine learning and emotional
sciences. Due to the spontaneous and subtle characteristics of
micro-expressions, the available training and testing data are limited, which
make evaluation complex. We show that data leakage and fragmented evaluation
protocols are issues among the micro-expression literature. We find that fixing
data leaks can drastically reduce model performance, in some cases even making
the models perform similarly to a random classifier. To this end, we go through
common pitfalls, propose a new standardized evaluation protocol using facial
action units with over 2000 micro-expression samples, and provide an open
source library that implements the evaluation protocols in a standardized
manner. Code is publicly available in \url{https://github.com/tvaranka/meb}.

					<dc:description>  Diffractive optical elements such as periodic gratings are fundamental
devices in X-ray imaging - a technique that medical, material science and
security scans rely upon. Fabrication of such structures with high aspect
ratios at the nanoscale creates opportunities to further advance such
applications, especially in terms of relaxing X-ray source coherence
requirements. This is because typical grating-based X-ray phase imaging
techniques (e.g., Talbot self-imaging) require a coherence length of at least
one grating period and ideally longer. In this paper, the fabrication
challenges in achieving high aspect-ratio nanogratings filled with gold are
addressed by a combination of laser interference and nanoimprint lithography,
physical vapor deposition, metal assisted chemical etching (MACE), and
electroplating. This relatively simple and cost-efficient approach is unlocked
by an innovative post-MACE drying step with hexamethyldisilazane, which
effectively minimizes the stiction of the nanostructures. The theoretical
limits of the approach are discussed and, experimentally, X-ray nanogratings
with aspect ratios &gt;40 demonstrated. Finally, their excellent diffractive
abilities are shown when exposed to a hard (12.2 keV) monochromatic x-ray beam
at a synchrotron facility, and thus potential applicability in phase-based
X-ray imaging.

					<dc:description>  We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique
for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to
accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating
universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream
data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a
ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes.
Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to
exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer
into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better
'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can
consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior
art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP
framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting),
which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and
progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a
contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an
LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the
target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we
show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target
tasks, our method outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and
6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and
CIFAR100 datasets. Besides, our proposal on CLIP-based VP provides 13.7% and
7.1% accuracy improvements on Flowers102 and DTD respectively. Our code is
available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/ILM-VP.

					<dc:description>  We integrate contrastive learning (CL) with adversarial learning to
co-optimize the robustness and accuracy of code models. Different from existing
works, we show that code obfuscation, a standard code transformation operation,
provides novel means to generate complementary `views' of a code that enable us
to achieve both robust and accurate code models. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first systematic study to explore and exploit the robustness and
accuracy benefits of (multi-view) code obfuscations in code models.
Specifically, we first adopt adversarial codes as robustness-promoting views in
CL at the self-supervised pre-training phase. This yields improved robustness
and transferability for downstream tasks. Next, at the supervised fine-tuning
stage, we show that adversarial training with a proper temporally-staggered
schedule of adversarial code generation can further improve robustness and
accuracy of the pre-trained code model. Built on the above two modules, we
develop CLAWSAT, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for code by
integrating $\underline{\textrm{CL}}$ with $\underline{\textrm{a}}$dversarial
vie$\underline{\textrm{w}}$s (CLAW) with $\underline{\textrm{s}}$taggered
$\underline{\textrm{a}}$dversarial $\underline{\textrm{t}}$raining (SAT). On
evaluating three downstream tasks across Python and Java, we show that CLAWSAT
consistently yields the best robustness and accuracy ($\textit{e.g.}$ 11$\%$ in
robustness and 6$\%$ in accuracy on the code summarization task in Python). We
additionally demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial learning in CLAW by
analyzing the characteristics of the loss landscape and interpretability of the
pre-trained models.

					<dc:title>Labeled Nearest Neighbor Search and Metric Spanners via Locality
  Sensitive Orderings</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Filtser, Arnold</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones [SICOMP 2020] developed locality-sensitive
orderings (LSO) for Euclidean space. A $(\tau,\rho)$-LSO is a collection
$\Sigma$ of orderings such that for every $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d$ there is an
ordering $\sigma\in\Sigma$, where all the points between $x$ and $y$ w.r.t.
$\sigma$ are in the $\rho$-neighborhood of either $x$ or $y$. In essence, LSO
allow one to reduce problems to the $1$-dimensional line. Later, Filtser and Le
[STOC 2022] developed LSO's for doubling metrics, general metric spaces, and
minor free graphs. For Euclidean and doubling spaces, the number of orderings
in the LSO is exponential in the dimension, which made them mainly useful for
the low dimensional regime. In this paper, we develop new LSO's for Euclidean,
$\ell_p$, and doubling spaces that allow us to trade larger stretch for a much
smaller number of orderings. We then use our new LSO's (as well as the previous
ones) to construct path reporting low hop spanners, fault tolerant spanners,
reliable spanners, and light spanners for different metric spaces. While many
nearest neighbor search (NNS) data structures were constructed for metric
spaces with implicit distance representations (where the distance between two
metric points can be computed using their names, e.g. Euclidean space), for
other spaces almost nothing is known. In this paper we initiate the study of
the labeled NNS problem, where one is allowed to artificially assign labels
(short names) to metric points. We use LSO's to construct efficient labeled NNS
data structures in this model.

					<dc:description>  In time-resolved pump-probe vibrational spectroscopy the internal stretch
mode of polar molecules is utilized as a key observable to characterize the
ultrafast dynamics of adsorbates on surfaces. The adsorbates non-adiabatic
intermode couplings are the commonly accepted mechanisms behind the observed
transient frequency shifts. Here, we study the CO/Pd(111) system with a robust
theoretical framework that includes electron-hole pair excitations and
electron-mediated coupling between the vibrational modes. A mechanism is
revealed that screens the electron-phonon interaction and originates a
blueshift under ultrafast non-equilibrium conditions. The results are explained
in terms of the abrupt change in the density of states around the Fermi level,
and are instrumental for understanding dynamics at multi-component surfaces
involving localized and standard $s$ or $p$ states.

					<dc:description>  In the wake of a cybersecurity incident, it is crucial to promptly discover
how the threat actors breached security in order to assess the impact of the
incident and to develop and deploy countermeasures that can protect against
further attacks. To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic
investigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in
the incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing
the investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each
technique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which
ones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery,
it is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts
with this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision
support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state-of-the-art
prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based
on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and
does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we
introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for
cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using
a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic
investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree
search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to
estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on
multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of
adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and
demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques
discovered per effort spent.

					<dc:description>  The framework of nuclear energy density functionals has been employed to
describe nuclear structure phenomena for a wide range of nuclei. Recently,
statistical properties of a given nuclear model, such as parameter confidence
intervals and correlations, have received much attention, particularly when one
tries to fit complex models. We apply information-theoretic methods to
investigate stability of model reductions by the manifold boundary
approximation method (MBAM). In an illustrative example of the
density-dependent point-coupling model of the relativistic energy density
functional, utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that main
conclusions obtained from the MBAM procedure are stable under variation of the
model parameters. Furthermore, we find that the end of the geodesic occurs when
the determinant of the Fisher information metric vanishes, thus effectively
separating the parameter space into two disconnected regions.

					<dc:description>  Every automaton can be decomposed into a cascade of basic prime automata.
This is the Prime Decomposition Theorem by Krohn and Rhodes. Guided by this
theory, we propose automata cascades as a structured, modular, way to describe
automata as complex systems made of many components, each implementing a
specific functionality. Any automaton can serve as a component; using specific
components allows for a fine-grained control of the expressivity of the
resulting class of automata; using prime automata as components implies
specific expressivity guarantees. Moreover, specifying automata as cascades
allows for describing the sample complexity of automata in terms of their
components. We show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of
components and the maximum complexity of a single component, modulo logarithmic
factors. This opens to the possibility of learning automata representing large
dynamical systems consisting of many parts interacting with each other. It is
in sharp contrast with the established understanding of the sample complexity
of automata, described in terms of the overall number of states and input
letters, which implies that it is only possible to learn automata where the
number of states is linear in the amount of data available. Instead our results
show that one can learn automata with a number of states that is exponential in
the amount of data available.

					<dc:description>  Alpha and cluster decays are analyzed for heavy nuclei located above
$^{208}$Pb on the chart of nuclides: $^{216-220}$Rn and $^{220-224}$Ra, that
are also candidates for observing the $2 \alpha$ decay mode. A microscopic
theoretical approach based on relativistic Energy Density Functionals (EDF), is
used to compute axially-symmetric deformation energy surfaces as functions of
quadrupole, octupole and hexadecupole collective coordinates. Dynamical
least-action paths for specific decay modes are calculated on the corresponding
potential energy surfaces. The effective collective inertia is determined using
the perturbative cranking approximation, and zero-point and rotational energy
corrections are included in the model. The predicted half-lives for
$\alpha$-decay are within one order of magnitude of the experimental values. In
the case of single $\alpha$ emission, the nuclei considered in the present
study exhibit least-action paths that differ significantly up to the scission
point. The differences in alpha-decay lifetimes are not only driven by Q
values, but also by variances of the least-action paths prior to scission. In
contrast, the $2 \alpha$ decay mode presents very similar paths from
equilibrium to scission, and the differences in lifetimes are mainly driven by
the corresponding Q values. The predicted $^{14}$C cluster decay half-lives are
within three orders of magnitudes of the empirical values, and point to a much
more complex pattern compared to the alpha-decay mode.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the ability of selective cavity coupling to a topological
chain for tailoring the connectivity of Majorana fermions. We show how
topological qubits (TQs), associated with non-local Majorana fermion pairing,
can be moved from the edge to the bulk of a topological chain through selective
access to light-matter interaction with specific physical sites. In particular,
we present a comprehensive DMRG study of ground-state features in different
chain-cavity coupling geometries and validate analytical insights in the strong
coupling regime. This new kind of Majorana fermion correlation generation
process comes with new cavity photon features. Moreover, by considering the
time evolution after a sudden quench of the cavity-matter coupling strength, we
show that the development of high non-trivial matter (Majorana) correlations
leaves off measurable non-classical photon imprints in the cavity. New ways to
dynamically generate TQ nonlocal correlations in topological chains of
arbitrary length are thus provided, opening alternative routes to controllable
long-range entanglement in hybrid photonic solid-state systems.

					<dc:description>  We propose an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate
time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is
based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into
subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii)
channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time
series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the
series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic
information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the
attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and
the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series
Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy
significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also
apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent
fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large
datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to
others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy. Code is available at:

					<dc:description>  The ground state energy is great importance for studying the properties of a
material. In this study, we computed both the Hartree-Fock approximation and
the random phase approximation of the ground state energy. Considering the
effect of the electrostatic shielding potential, we utilized the Thomas-Fermi
dielectric function to obtain the Thomas-Fermi formula for the total potential
energy. We subsequently calculated the total potential energy of the metallic
and non-metallic elements in the periodic table using Wigner correlation energy
and Hedin-Lundqvist correlation energy, considering the changes in the
correlation energies after considering electrostatic shielding effects.The
exchange correlation potential including electrostatic shielding effect can be
used in the measurement of SIM experiments.

					<dc:description>  Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a typical method for classification
problems with large dimensions and small samples. There are various types of
LDA methods that are based on the different types of estimators for the
covariance matrices and mean vectors. In this paper, we consider shrinkage
methods based on a non-parametric approach. For the precision matrix, methods
based on the sparsity structure or data splitting are examined. Regarding the
estimation of mean vectors, Non-parametric Empirical Bayes (NPEB) methods and
Non-parametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE) methods, also known as
f-modeling and g-modeling, respectively, are adopted. The performance of linear
discriminant rules based on combined estimation strategies of the covariance
matrix and mean vectors are analyzed in this study. Particularly, the study
presents a theoretical result on the performance of the NPEB method and
compares it with previous studies. Simulation studies with various covariance
matrices and mean vector structures are conducted to evaluate the methods
discussed in this paper. Furthermore, real data examples such as gene
expressions and EEG data are also presented

					<dc:description>  High-fidelity facial avatar reconstruction from a monocular video is a
significant research problem in computer graphics and computer vision.
Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive novel view
rendering results and has been considered for facial avatar reconstruction.
However, the complex facial dynamics and missing 3D information in monocular
videos raise significant challenges for faithful facial reconstruction. In this
work, we propose a new method for NeRF-based facial avatar reconstruction that
utilizes 3D-aware generative prior. Different from existing works that depend
on a conditional deformation field for dynamic modeling, we propose to learn a
personalized generative prior, which is formulated as a local and low
dimensional subspace in the latent space of 3D-GAN. We propose an efficient
method to construct the personalized generative prior based on a small set of
facial images of a given individual. After learning, it allows for
photo-realistic rendering with novel views and the face reenactment can be
realized by performing navigation in the latent space. Our proposed method is
applicable for different driven signals, including RGB images, 3DMM
coefficients, and audios. Compared with existing works, we obtain superior
novel view synthesis results and faithfully face reenactment performance.

					<dc:description>  Besides moir\'e superlattice, twisting can also generate moir\'e magnetic
exchange interactions (MMEIs) in van der Waals magnets. However, due to the
extreme complexity and twist-angle-dependent sensitivity, all existing models
fail to capture the MMEIs, preventing the understanding of MMEIs-induced new
physics. Here, we develop a microscopic moir\'e spin Hamiltonian that enables
the effective description of MMEIs via a sliding-mapping approach in twisted
magnets, as demonstrated in twisted bilayer CrI3. Unexpectedly, we discover
that the emergence of MMEIs can create an unprecedented magnetic skyrmion
bubble (SkB) with non-conversed helicity, named as moir\'e-type SkB,
representing a unique spin texture solely generated by MMEIs and ready to be
detected under the current experimental conditions. Importantly, the size and
population of SkBs can be finely controlled by twist angle, a key step for
skyrmion-based quantum computing and information storage. Furthermore, we
reveal that the MMEIs can be effectively manipulated by the substrate-induced
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, modulating the
twist-angle-dependent magnetic phase diagram, which solves the outstanding
disagreements between prior theories and experiments and verifies our theory.

					<dc:description>  We explore unifying a neural segmenter with two-pass cascaded encoder ASR
into a single model. A key challenge is allowing the segmenter (which runs in
real-time, synchronously with the decoder) to finalize the 2nd pass (which runs
900 ms behind real-time) without introducing user-perceived latency or deletion
errors during inference. We propose a design where the neural segmenter is
integrated with the causal 1st pass decoder to emit a end-of-segment (EOS)
signal in real-time. The EOS signal is then used to finalize the non-causal 2nd
pass. We experiment with different ways to finalize the 2nd pass, and find that
a novel dummy frame injection strategy allows for simultaneous high quality 2nd
pass results and low finalization latency. On a real-world long-form captioning
task (YouTube), we achieve 2.4% relative WER and 140 ms EOS latency gains over
a baseline VAD-based segmenter with the same cascaded encoder.

					<dc:description>  In an era of countless content offerings, recommender systems alleviate
information overload by providing users with personalized content suggestions.
Due to the scarcity of explicit user feedback, modern recommender systems
typically optimize for the same fixed combination of implicit feedback signals
across all users. However, this approach disregards a growing body of work
highlighting that (i) implicit signals can be used by users in diverse ways,
signaling anything from satisfaction to active dislike, and (ii) different
users communicate preferences in different ways. We propose applying the recent
Interaction Grounded Learning (IGL) paradigm to address the challenge of
learning representations of diverse user communication modalities. Rather than
requiring a fixed, human-designed reward function, IGL is able to learn
personalized reward functions for different users and then optimize directly
for the latent user satisfaction. We demonstrate the success of IGL with
experiments using simulations as well as with real-world production traces.

					<dc:description>  This note addresses the problem of computing fermion propagators in a broad
variety of strongly correlated systems that can be mapped onto the theory of
fermions coupled to an (over)damped bosonic mode. A number of the previously
applied approaches and their results are reviewed, including the conventional
diagrammatic resummation and eikonal technique, as well as the 'experimental'
higher dimensional bosonization and generalized (i.e., 'bottom-up' or
'non-AdS/non-CFT') holographic conjecture. It appears that, by and large, those
results remain either in conflict or incomplete, thereby suggesting that the
ultimate solution to this ubiquitous problem is yet to be found.

					<dc:description>  The problem of elastic scattering of electron Airy beams on potential fields
is considered for a hydrogen atom in the ground state and for Yukawa potential.
It is demonstrated that the angular dependence of the scattering probability
density is in general azimuthally asymmetric. When the position of the atom
happens to coincide with one the minima of the probability density of the Airy
beam the asymmetric pattern is represented by four separated peaks. We show
that this behaviour is very sensitive to the precision with which the relative
position of the atom and the minima is defined and study how uncertainty in the
position measured in terms of the transverse size of the wave-packet affects
observation of azimuthal asymmetry. Finally, we consider a spatially localized
target and discuss the difficulties of observing the azimuthal asymmetry for
targets with sizes that exceed the critical value determined by the beam
parameters and the position of the target center.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the dynamics of a single chiral active particle subject to an
external torque due to the presence of a gravitational field. Our computer
simulations reveal an arbitrarily strong increase of the long-time diffusivity
of the gravitactic agent when the external torque approaches the intrinsic
angular drift. We provide analytic expressions for the mean-square displacement
in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the noisy-driven-pendulum
problem. The pronounced maximum in the diffusivity is then rationalized by the
vanishing of the lowest eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck equation for the
angular motion as the rotational diffusion decreases and the underlying
classical bifurcation is approached. A simple harmonic-oscillator picture for
the barrier-dominated motion provides a quantitative description for the onset
of the resonance while its range of validity is determined by the crossover to
a critical-fluctuation-dominated regime.

					<dc:description>  We analyze the $f(R)$ gravity in the so-called Jordan frame, as implemented
to the isotropic Universe dynamics. The goal of the present study is to show
that, according to recent data analyses of the supernovae Ia Pantheon sample,
it is possible to account for an effective redshift-dependence of the Hubble
constant via the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled scalar field, emerging in
the $f(R)$ gravity. We face the question both from an analytical and purely
numerical point of view, following the same technical paradigm. We arrive to
establish that the expected decay of the Hubble constant with the redshift $z$
is ensured by a form of the scalar field potential, which remains essentially
constant for $z\lesssim0.3$, independently if this request is made a priori, as
in the analytical approach, or obtained a posteriori, when the numerical
procedure is addressed. Thus, we demonstrate that an $f(R)$ dark energy model
is able to account for an apparent variation of the Hubble constant due to the
rescaling of the Einstein constant by the $f(R)$ scalar mode.

					<dc:description>  Score-based modeling through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) has
provided a new perspective on diffusion models, and demonstrated superior
performance on continuous data. However, the gradient of the log-likelihood
function, i.e., the score function, is not properly defined for discrete
spaces. This makes it non-trivial to adapt \textcolor{\cdiff}{the score-based
modeling} to categorical data. In this paper, we extend diffusion models to
discrete variables by introducing a stochastic jump process where the reverse
process denoises via a continuous-time Markov chain. This formulation admits an
analytical simulation during backward sampling. To learn the reverse process,
we extend score matching to general categorical data and show that an unbiased
estimator can be obtained via simple matching of the conditional marginal
distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set
of synthetic and real-world music and image benchmarks.

					<dc:description>  Recent development of deep neural networks (DNNs) for tabular learning has
largely benefited from the capability of DNNs for automatic feature
interaction. However, the heterogeneity nature of tabular features makes such
features relatively independent, and developing effective methods to promote
tabular feature interaction still remains an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel Graph Estimator, which automatically estimates the relations
among tabular features and builds graphs by assigning edges between related
features. Such relation graphs organize independent tabular features into a
kind of graph data such that interaction of nodes (tabular features) can be
conducted in an orderly fashion. Based on our proposed Graph Estimator, we
present a bespoke Transformer network tailored for tabular learning, called
T2G-Former, which processes tabular data by performing tabular feature
interaction guided by the relation graphs. A specific Cross-level Readout
collects salient features predicted by the layers in T2G-Former across
different levels, and attains global semantics for final prediction.
Comprehensive experiments show that our T2G-Former achieves superior
performance among DNNs and is competitive with non-deep Gradient Boosted
Decision Tree models.

					<dc:description>  Astrophysical models of planet formation require accurate radiometric dating
of meteoritic components by short-lived (Al-Mg, Mn-Cr, Hf-W) and long-lived
(Pb-Pb) chronometers, to develop a timeline of such events in the solar nebula
as formation of Ca-rich, Al-rich Inclusions (CAIs), chondrules, planetesimals,
etc. CAIs formed mostly around a time (&quot;t=0&quot;) when the short-lived radionuclide
26Al (t1/2 = 0.72 Myr) was present and presumably homogeneously distributed at
a known level we define as (26Al/27Al)SS = 5.23 x10^-5. The time of formation
after t=0 of another object can be found by determining its initial
(26Al/27Al)0 ratio and comparing it to (26Al/27Al)SS. Dating of meteoritic
objects using the Mn-Cr or Hf-W systems is hindered because the abundances
(53Mn/55Mn)SS and (182Hf/180Hf)SS at t=0 are not known precisely. To constrain
these quantities, we compile literature Al-Mg, Mn-Cr, Hf-W and Pb-Pb data for
14 achondrites and use novel statistical techniques to minimize the
discrepancies between their times of formation across these systems. We find
that for (53Mn/55Mn)SS = (8.09+/-0.65)x10^-6, (182Hf/180Hf)SS =
(10.42+/-0.25)x10^-5, tSS = 4568.36+/-0.20 Myr, and a 53Mn half-life of
3.80+/-0.23 Myr, these four free parameters make concordant 37 formation times
recorded by the different systems in 14 achondrites. These parameters also make
concordant the ages derived for chondrules from CB/CH achondrites, formed
simultaneously in an impact, and are apparently concordant with the I-Xe
chronometer as well. Our findings provide very strong support for homogeneity
of 26Al, 53Mn, and 182Hf in the solar nebula, and our approach offers a
framework for more precise chronometry.

					<dc:description>  We use rapidly cooled achondrites to test the assumption of 26Al homogeneity
in the solar nebula, by checking if there is a single value of tSS, the
absolute &quot;Pb-Pb&quot; age of the Solar System's t=0, that makes concordant their
ages from the Al-Mg and Pb-Pb systems. We find that values tSS = 4568.42
+/-0.24 Myr do make these ages concordant, and therefore the hypothesis of
homogeneous 26Al is not falsified. This age, defined to be when the solar
nebula had (26Al/27Al) = 5.23 x 10^-5, is significantly older than the ~4567.3
Myr inferred from direct measurements of Pb-Pb ages in CAIs. Discrepancies
between the Al-Mg and Pb-Pb chronometers in chondrules and CAIs have previously
been interpreted as arising from heterogeneities in 26Al, under the presumption
that the Al-Mg and Pb-Pb systems in CAIs closed simultaneously. We examine this
assumption and show that resetting is to be expected in CAIs. In particular, we
quantitatively demonstrate that it is plausible that Pb-Pb ages of CAIs were
reset at late times, without resetting the earlier Al-Mg ages, if they were
transiently heated in the same manner as chondrules. We critically examine
Pb-Pb isochrons, refining data and suggesting best practices for their
calculation and reporting. We advocate reporting chronometry as times of
formation after t=0 rather than absolute ages, as only the former is useful for
astrophysical models of the solar nebula. We strongly advocate averaging of
multiple samples, rather than anchoring to individual meteorites, to improve
precision.

					<dc:description>  Survival analysis is the branch of statistics that studies the relation
between the characteristics of living entities and their respective survival
times, taking into account the partial information held by censored cases. A
good analysis can, for example, determine whether one medical treatment for a
group of patients is better than another. With the rise of machine learning,
survival analysis can be modeled as learning a function that maps studied
patients to their survival times. To succeed with that, there are three crucial
issues to be tackled. First, some patient data is censored: we do not know the
true survival times for all patients. Second, data is scarce, which led past
research to treat different illness types as domains in a multi-task setup.
Third, there is the need for adaptation to new or extremely rare illness types,
where little or no labels are available. In contrast to previous multi-task
setups, we want to investigate how to efficiently adapt to a new survival
target domain from multiple survival source domains. For this, we introduce a
new survival metric and the corresponding discrepancy measure between survival
distributions. These allow us to define domain adaptation for survival analysis
while incorporating censored data, which would otherwise have to be dropped.
Our experiments on two cancer data sets reveal a superb performance on target
domains, a better treatment recommendation, and a weight matrix with a
plausible explanation.

					<dc:description>  Detailed investigations of structural, magnetic and electronic transport
properties of hole-doped high-entropy rare-earth manganites are presented. The
high-entropy samples (LaNdPrSmEu)$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$
(0$\leq$\textit{x}$\leq$0.5), synthesized using the solid-state technique, show
a change in the crystal structure from \textit{Pbnm} to \textit{R-3c} with
increasing Sr substitution, attributed to the change in the tolerance factor.
Prominent ferromagnetic ordering is observed in the sample with a rhombohedral
structure (\textit{x}$\geq$0.3), originating from the dominant double exchange
mechanism mediated by itinerant electrons. Further, the Curie temperature is
smaller for the high-entropy sample with \textit{x}=0.3, as compared to
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$, suggesting a strong relation between the Curie
temperature and the Mn-O-Mn bond angle associated with the reduced ionic radii
at the rare-earth site. The electrical resistivity of the high-entropy samples
is larger than those of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$, which can be ascribed to the
reduced bandwidth due to the enhanced structural distortion. A concomitant rise
in magnetoresistance is observed for high-entropy samples with the increase in
Sr concentration. These findings considering the configurational complexity of
different rare-earths advance the understanding of high-entropy rare earth
manganites.

					<dc:description>  The paper observes an almost Hermitian manifold as an example of a
generalized Riemannian manifold and examines the application of a
quarter-symmetric connection on the almost Hermitian manifold. The almost
Hermitian manifold with quarter-symmetric connection preserving the generalized
Riemannian metric is actually the K\&quot;ahler manifold. Observing the six linearly
independent curvature tensors with respect to the quarter-symmetric connection,
we construct tensors that do not depend on the quarter-symmetric connection
generator. One of them coincides with the Weyl projective curvature tensor of
symmetric Riemannian metric $g$. Also, we obtain the relations between the Weyl
projective curvature tensor and the holomorphically projective curvature
tensor. Moreover, we examine the properties of curvature tensors when some
tensors are hybrid.

					<dc:description>  We propose a rigorous full-wave modal analysis based on the eigenmodes
approach (\textquotedblleft supermodes\textquotedblright), that allows the
calculation of the transverse electric ($TE$) and transverse magnetic ($TM$)
stationary propagation eigenmodes in a coupled $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric slab
waveguide. Our findings show that the group velocity, for the fundamental
$TE_{0}$ supermode, passes from superluminal to subluminal speed over both
sides of a critical point (CP), located near to the exceptional point (EP). We
also demonstrate that the first higher-order supermode, $TE_{1}$, exhibits a
slow light phenomenon around the EP.

					<dc:title>New physics in $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$: A model independent analysis</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Chundawat, Neetu Raj Singh</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work we consider the implications of current $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$
($\ell=e,\,\mu$) measurements on several $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$ observables
under the assumption that the possible new physics can have both universal as
well as nonuniversal couplings to leptons. For new physics solutions which
provide a good fit to all $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data, we intend to identify
observables with large deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions as
well as to discriminate between various new physics solutions. For this we
consider the $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$ branching fraction, the $K^*$
longitudinal fraction $f_L$, the tau forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ and
the optimized observables in the $P_i^{(')}$ basis. Further, we construct the
$\tau - \mu$ lepton-flavor differences ($Q^{\tau\mu}$) between these tau
observables and their muonic counterparts in $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay.
Moreover, we also consider lepton-flavor ratios ($R^{\tau\mu}$) of all of these
observables. We find that the current data allows for deviations ranging from
25% up to an order of magnitude from the SM value in a number of observables.
For e.g., the magnitudes of $Q^{\tau \mu}_{P_3}$ and $Q^{\tau \mu}_{P'_8}$
observables can be enhanced up to an order of magnitude, a twofold enhancement
in $Q^{\tau\mu}_{A_{FB}}$ is possible along with $\sim$50% enhancement in
$R^{\tau\mu}_{K^*}$ and $\sim$25% in $R^{\tau\mu}_{A_{FB}}$. Moreover, the
branching ratio of $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$ can be suppressed up to 25%. A
precise measurement of these observables can also discriminate between a number
of new physics solutions.

					<dc:description>  Hidden sectors are ubiquitous in supergravity theories, in strings and in
branes. Well motivated models such as the Stueckelberg hidden sector model
could provide a candidate for dark matter. In such models, the hidden sector
communicates with the visible sector via the exchange of a dark photon (dark
$Z'$) while dark matter is constituted of Dirac fermions in the hidden sector.
Using data from collider searches and precision measurements of SM processes as
well as the most recent limits from dark matter direct and indirect detection
experiments, we perform a comprehensive scan over a wide range of the $Z'$ mass
and set exclusion bounds on the parameter space from sub-GeV to several TeV. We
then discuss the discovery potential of an $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) scale $Z'$ at
HL-LHC and the ability of future forward detectors to probe very weakly
interacting sub-GeV $Z'$ bosons. Our analysis shows that the parameter space in
which a $Z'$ can decay to hidden sector dark matter is severely constrained
whereas limits become much weaker for a $Z'$ with no dark decays. The analysis
also favors a self-thermalized dark sector which is necessary to satisfy the
dark matter relic density.

					<dc:description>  We study fair multi-objective reinforcement learning in which an agent must
learn a policy that simultaneously achieves high reward on multiple dimensions
of a vector-valued reward. Motivated by the fair resource allocation
literature, we model this as an expected welfare maximization problem, for some
non-linear fair welfare function of the vector of long-term cumulative rewards.
One canonical example of such a function is the Nash Social Welfare, or
geometric mean, the log transform of which is also known as the Proportional
Fairness objective. We show that even approximately optimal optimization of the
expected Nash Social Welfare is computationally intractable even in the tabular
case. Nevertheless, we provide a novel adaptation of Q-learning that combines
non-linear scalarized learning updates and non-stationary action selection to
learn effective policies for optimizing nonlinear welfare functions. We show
that our algorithm is provably convergent, and we demonstrate experimentally
that our approach outperforms techniques based on linear scalarization,
mixtures of optimal linear scalarizations, or stationary action selection for
the Nash Social Welfare Objective.

					<dc:description>  We propose a general approach to analyse diagonal ordering patterns in
bosonic lattice models with algebraically decaying density-density interactions
on arbitrary lattices. The key idea is a systematic search for the
energetically best order on all unit cells of the lattice up to a given extent.
Using resummed couplings we evaluate the energy of the ordering patterns in the
thermodynamic limit using finite unit cells. We apply the proposed approach to
the atomic limit of the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice
at fillings $f=1/2$ and $f=1$. We investigate the ground-state properties of
the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model on the triangular lattice and
determine a six-fold degenerate plain-stripe phase to be the ground state for
finite decay exponents. We also probe the classical limit of the
Fendley-Sengupta-Sachdev model describing Rydberg atom arrays. We focus on
arrangements where the atoms are placed on the sites or links of the Kagome
lattice. \changed{Our method provides a general framework to treat cristalline
structures resulting from long-range interactions.

					<dc:description>  Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and limited resolution of functional MRI
data, and the high complexity of natural images, reconstructing a visual
stimulus from human brain fMRI measurements is a challenging task. In this
work, we propose a novel approach for this task, which we call Cortex2Image, to
decode visual stimuli with high semantic fidelity and rich fine-grained detail.
In particular, we train a surface-based convolutional network model that maps
from brain response to semantic image features first (Cortex2Semantic). We then
combine this model with a high-quality image generator (Instance-Conditioned
GAN) to train another mapping from brain response to fine-grained image
features using a variational approach (Cortex2Detail). Image reconstructions
obtained by our proposed method achieve state-of-the-art semantic fidelity,
while yielding good fine-grained similarity with the ground-truth stimulus. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/zijin-gu/meshconv-decoding.git.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Learning style refers to a type of training mechanism adopted by an
individual to gain new knowledge. As suggested by the VARK model, humans have
different learning preferences like visual, auditory, etc., for acquiring and
effectively processing information. Inspired by this concept, our work explores
the idea of mixed information sharing with model compression in the context of
Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Mutual Learning (ML). Unlike conventional
techniques that share the same type of knowledge with all networks, we propose
to train individual networks with different forms of information to enhance the
learning process. We formulate a combined KD and ML framework with one teacher
and two student networks that share or exchange information in the form of
predictions and feature maps. Our comprehensive experiments with benchmark
classification and segmentation datasets demonstrate that with 15% compression,
the ensemble performance of networks trained with diverse forms of knowledge
outperforms the conventional techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.

					<dc:description>  Cities are continuously evolving human settlements. Our cities are under
strain in an increasingly urbanized world, and planners, decision-makers, and
communities must be ready to adapt. Data is an important resource for municipal
administration. Some technologies aid in the collection, processing, and
visualization of urban data, assisting in the interpretation and comprehension
of how urban systems operate. The relationship between data analytics and smart
cities has come to light in recent years as interest in both has grown. A
sophisticated network of interconnected systems, including planners and
inhabitants, is what is known as a smart city. Data analysis has the potential
to support data-driven decision-making in the context of smart cities. Both
urban managers and residents are becoming more interested in city dashboards.
Dashboards may collect, display, analyze, and provide information on regional
performance to help smart cities development have sustainability. In order to
assist decision-making processes and enhance the performance of cities, we
examine how dashboards might be used to acquire accurate and representative
information regarding urban challenges. This chapter culminates Data Analytics
on key indicators for the city's urban services and dashboards for leadership
and decision-making. A single web page with consolidated information, real-time
data streams pertinent to planners and decision-makers as well as residents'
everyday lives, and site analytics as a method to assess user interactions and
preferences are among the proposals for urban dashboards.

					<dc:description>  We report the implementation of a multi-CPU and multi-GPU massively parallel
platform dedicated to the explicit inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs)
in the Tinker-HP molecular dynamics (MD) package. The platform, denoted
Quantum-HP, exploits two simulation strategies: the Ring-Polymer Molecular
Dynamics (RPMD) that provides exact structural properties at the cost of a MD
simulation in an extended space of multiple replicas, and the adaptive Quantum
Thermal Bath (adQTB) that imposes the quantum distribution of energy on a
classical system via a generalized Langevin thermostat and provides
computationally affordable and accurate (though approximate) NQEs. We discuss
some implementation details, efficient numerical schemes, parallelization
strategies and quickly review the GPU acceleration of our code. Our
implementation allows an efficient inclusion of NQEs in MD simulations for very
large systems, as demonstrated by scaling tests on water boxes with more than
200,000 atoms (simulated using the AMOEBA polarizable force field). We test the
compatibility of the approach with Tinker-HP's recently introduced Deep-HP
machine learning potentials module by computing water properties using the
DeePMD potential with adQTB thermostating. Finally, we show that the platform
is also compatible with the alchemical free energy estimation capabilities of
Tinker-HP and fast enough to perform simulations. Therefore, we study how the
NQEs affect the hydration free energy of small molecules solvated with the
recently developed Q-AMOEBA water force field. Overall, the Quantum-HP platform
allows users to perform routine quantum MD simulations of large condensed-phase
systems and will participate to shed a new light on the quantum nature of
important interactions in biological matter.

					<dc:description>  Deviations from the Standard Model (SM) can be parameterized in terms of the
SM effective field theory (SMEFT), which is typically truncated at dimension-6.
Including higher dimension operators -- as well as considering simultaneous
insertions of multiple dimension-6 operators -- may be necessary in some
processes, in order to correctly capture the properties of the underlying UV
theory. As a step towards clarifying this in the Higgs boson production in
gluon fusion process, we study double insertions of dimension-6 operators in
the 1-loop virtual amplitude. We present needed Feynman rules up to
$\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^4)$ and we numerically study the impact of various
approximations to the $\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^4)$ expansion.

					<dc:description>  We study the vacua of $4d$ heterotic toroidal orbifolds using effective
theories consisting of an overall K\&quot;{a}hler modulus, the dilaton, and
non-perturbative corrections to both the superpotential and K\&quot;{a}hler
potential that respect modular invariance. We prove three de Sitter no-go
theorems for several classes of vacua and thereby substantiate and extend
previous conjectures. Additionally, we provide evidence that extrema of the
scalar potential can occur inside the PSL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ fundamental domain of
the K\&quot;{a}hler modulus, in contradiction of a separate conjecture. We also
illustrate a loophole in the no-go theorems and determine criteria that allow
for metastable de Sitter vacua. Finally, we identify inherently stringy
non-perturbative effects in the dilaton sector that could exploit this loophole
and potentially realize de Sitter vacua

					<dc:description>  Everting, soft growing vine robots benefit from reduced friction with their
environment, which allows them to navigate challenging terrain. Vine robots can
use air pouches attached to their sides for lateral steering. However, when all
pouches are serially connected, the whole robot can only perform one constant
curvature in free space. It must contact the environment to navigate through
obstacles along paths with multiple turns. This work presents a multi-segment
vine robot that can navigate complex paths without interacting with its
environment. This is achieved by a new steering method that selectively
actuates each single pouch at the tip, providing high degrees of freedom with
few control inputs. A small magnetic valve connects each pouch to a pressure
supply line. A motorized tip mount uses an interlocking mechanism and motorized
rollers on the outer material of the vine robot. As each valve passes through
the tip mount, a permanent magnet inside the tip mount opens the valve so the
corresponding pouch is connected to the pressure supply line at the same
moment. Novel cylindrical pneumatic artificial muscles (cPAMs) are integrated
into the vine robot and inflate to a cylindrical shape for improved bending
characteristics compared to other state-of-the-art vine robots. The motorized
tip mount controls a continuous eversion speed and enables controlled
retraction. A final prototype was able to repeatably grow into different shapes
and hold these shapes. We predict the path using a model that assumes a
piecewise constant curvature along the outside of the multi-segment vine robot.
The proposed multi-segment steering method can be extended to other soft
continuum robot designs.

					<dc:creator>Igoshev, P. A.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Katanin, A. A.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We investigate the possibility of ferromagnetic ordering in the
non-degenerate Hubbard model on the face-centered cubic lattice within the
functional renormalization group technique using temperature as a scale
parameter. We assume the relations between nearest, next-nearest, and
next-next-nearest hopping parameters providing higher order (giant) van Hove
singularity of the density of states. The ferromagnetic instability formation
with lowering temperature is described consistently in the one-loop
approximation for a one-particle irreducible vertex of two-particle electron
interaction. The chemical potential versus temperature phase diagrams are
calculated. We find ferromagnetic order only for sufficiently strong divergence
of the density of states and fillings in the vicinity of van Hove singularity.
The obtained Curie temperature is more than an order of magnitude smaller than
the results of the random-phase approximation. The main origin of the
suppression of ferromagnetism is the screening of interaction in the
particle-particle channel. We also do not find the pronounced tendency towards
incommensurate order when the Fermi level is moved away from a van Hove
singularity, such that the first order quantum phase transitions from the
ferro- to paramagnetic phase are obtained.

					<dc:subject>Physics - Fluid Dynamics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  With the increasing amount of available data from simulations and
experiments, research for the development of data-driven models for wind-farm
power prediction has increased significantly. While the data-driven models can
successfully predict the power of a wind farm with similar characteristics as
those in the training ensemble, they generally do not have a high degree of
flexibility for extrapolation to unseen cases in contrast to the physics-based
models. In this paper, we focus on data-driven models with improved
interpretability and generalizability levels that can predict the performance
of turbines in wind farms. To prepare the datasets, several cases are defined
based on the layouts of operational wind farms, and massive computational fluid
dynamics simulations are performed. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm is
used afterward to build models, which have turbine-level geometric inputs in
combination with the efficiency from physics-based models as the features.
After training, to analyze the models' capability in generalization, their
predictions for the unseen cases with different operating conditions, inflow
turbulence levels, and wind-farm layouts are compared to the Park model and an
empirical-analytical Gaussian wake model. Results show that the physics-guided
machine-learning models outperform both physics-based models showing a high
degree of generalizability, and the machine is not sensitive to the choice of
the physics-based guide model.

					<dc:description>  The quantitative description of the scientific conference MECO (Middle
European Cooperation in Statistical Physics) based on bibliographic records is
presented in the paper. Statistics of contributions and participants,
co-authorship patterns at the levels of authors and countries, typical
proportions of newcomers and permanent participants as well as other
characteristics of the scientific event are discussed. The results of this case
study contribute to better understanding of the ways of formalization and
assessment of conferences and their role in individual academic careers. To
highlight the latter, the change of perspective is used: in addition to the
general analysis of the conference data, an ego-centric approach is used to
emphasize the role of a particular participant for the conference and, vice
versa, the role of MECO in the researcher's professional life. This paper is
part of the special CMP issue dedicated to the anniversary of Bertrand Berche -
a well-known physicist, an active member of the community of authors and
editors of the journal, long time collaborator and dear friend of the author.

					<dc:description>  Warm natural inflation is studied for the case of the original cosine
potential. The radiation bath during inflation induces a dissipation (friction)
rate in the equation of motion for the inflaton field, which can potentially
reduce the field excursion needed for an observationally viable period of
inflation. We examine if the dissipation thus provides a mechanism to avoid the
large decay constant $f \gtrsim M_{\mathrm{pl}}$ of cold cosine natural
inflation. Whereas temperature independent dissipation has previously been
shown to alleviate the need for a trans-Planckian decay constant $f$, we
illustrate here the difficulties of accommodating a significantly sub-Planckian
decay constant ($f&lt;10^{-1}M_{\mathrm{pl}}$) in the case of the following
temperature dependent dissipation rates, $\Gamma \propto T^c$, with
$c=\{1,3\}$. Such dissipation rates represent physically well-motivated
constructions in the literature. For each model, we map its location in the
$r$-$n_s$ plane and compare with Cosmic Microwave Background data. For $c=1 \,
(c=3)$, we find that agreement with CMB data requires that dissipation be in
the weak (moderate) regime and that the minimum allowed value of the decay
constant in the potential is $f_{\rm min} = 0.3 \, (0.8)\,M_{\mathrm{pl}}$
respectively.

					<dc:title>Purcell factor for plasmon-enhanced metal photoluminescence</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Physics - Optics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We present an analytical model for plasmonic enhancement of metal
photoluminescence (MPL) in metal nanostructures with characteristic size below
the diffraction limit. In such systems, the primary mechanism of MPL
enhancement is excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSP) by recombining
carriers followed by a photon emission due to LSP radiative decay. For
plasmonic nanostructures of arbitrary shape, we obtain a universal expression
for MPL Purcell factor that describes the plasmonic enhancement of MPL in terms
of metal dielectric function, LSP frequency, and the system volume. We find
that the lineshape of MPL spectrum is affected by the interference between
direct carrier recombination processes and those mediated by plasmonic antenna
which leads to a blueshift of MPL spectral band relative to LSP resonance in
scattering spectra observed in numerous experiments.

					<dc:description>  We study the invisible scalar of $S$ in charmed meson and baryon decays with
flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) based on the model-independent
effective Lagrangian between the quarks and invisible scalar. From the bounds
of the coupling constants extracted from the recent BES III experiment on the
decay of $D^{0}\to\pi^{0}\bar\nu\nu$, we predict that the decay branching
ratios of $D^{+}\to\pi^{+}S$, $D_s^+\to K^+S$, $\Lambda_c\to pS$,
$\Xi_c^{0(+)}\to \Sigma^{0(+)}S$, and $\Xi_c^0\to\Lambda S$ can be as large as
$10.6,~2.53,~2.39,~0.963,~5.77$, and $2.92\times10^{-4}$ with $m_{_S}\approx
1.1~{\rm GeV}$, respectively. Some of these decay modes are accessible to the
ongoing experiments, such as BES III, LHCb and Belle II, as well as the future
ones, such as FCC-ee.

					<dc:description>  Based on independent shear measurements using the DECaLS/DR8 imaging data, we
measure the weak lensing signals around isolated central galaxies (ICGs) from
SDSS/DR7 at $z\sim0.1$. The projected stellar mass density profiles of
surrounding satellite galaxies are further deduced, using photometric sources
from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey (pDR3). The signals of ICGs $+$ their
extended stellar halos are taken from Wang et al.(2021). All measurements are
compared with predictions by the Illustris-TNG300-1 simulation. We find,
overall, a good agreement between observation and TNG300. In particular, a
correction to the stellar mass of massive observed ICGs is applied based on the
calibration of He et al.(2013), which brings a much better agreement with
TNG300 predicted lensing signals at $\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot&gt;11.1$. In real
observation, red ICGs are hosted by more massive dark matter halos, have more
satellites and more extended stellar halos than blue ICGs at fixed stellar
mass. However, in TNG300 there are more satellites around blue ICGs at fixed
stellar mass, and the outer stellar halos of red and blue ICGs are similar. The
stellar halos of TNG galaxies are more extended compared with real observed
galaxies, especially for blue ICGs with $\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot&gt;10.8$. We find
the same trend for TNG100 galaxies and for true halo central galaxies. The
tensions between TNG and real galaxies might indicate that satellite
disruptions are stronger in TNG. In both TNG300 and observation, satellites
approximately trace the underlying dark matter distribution beyond
$0.1R_{200}$, but the fraction of total stellar mass in TNG300 does not show
the same radial distribution as real galaxies.

white dwarfs. We derive the Lane-Emden-Chandrasekhar equation and relate it to
the cooling process equations for Palatini $f(R)$ gravity. Moreover, for the
first time in the literature, we show that the gravity model plays a crucial
role not only in the mass and size of the white dwarf, but also affects their
internal properties. We further demonstrate that modified gravity can decrease
the cooling age significantly.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the wild nonabelian Hodge correspondence for
principal $G$-bundles on curves, where $G$ is a connected complex reductive
group. We establish the correspondence under a ``very good&quot; condition
introduced by Boalch, and thus confirm one of his conjectures. We first give a
version of Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence, which induces a one-to-one
correspondence between stable meromorphic parahoric Higgs torsors of degree
zero (Dolbeault side) and stable meromorphic parahoric connections of degree
zero (de Rham side). Then, by introducing a notion of stability condition on
filtered Stokes local systems, we prove a one-to-one correspondence between
stable meromorphic parahoric connections of degree zero (de Rham side) and
stable filtered Stokes $G$-local systems of degree zero (Betti side). When
$G={\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, the main result in this paper reduces to
Biquad--Boalch's result.

					<dc:description>  Generic image inpainting aims to complete a corrupted image by borrowing
surrounding information, which barely generates novel content. By contrast,
multi-modal inpainting provides more flexible and useful controls on the
inpainted content, \eg, a text prompt can be used to describe an object with
richer attributes, and a mask can be used to constrain the shape of the
inpainted object rather than being only considered as a missing area. We
propose a new diffusion-based model named SmartBrush for completing a missing
region with an object using both text and shape-guidance. While previous work
such as DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion can do text-guided inapinting they do not
support shape guidance and tend to modify background texture surrounding the
generated object. Our model incorporates both text and shape guidance with
precision control. To preserve the background better, we propose a novel
training and sampling strategy by augmenting the diffusion U-net with
object-mask prediction. Lastly, we introduce a multi-task training strategy by
jointly training inpainting with text-to-image generation to leverage more
training data. We conduct extensive experiments showing that our model
outperforms all baselines in terms of visual quality, mask controllability, and
background preservation.

					<dc:description>  For a finite group $G$, a $G$-crossed braided fusion category is $G$-graded
fusion category with additional structures, namely a $G$-action and a
$G$-braiding. We develop the notion of $G$-crossed braided zesting: an explicit
method for constructing new $G$-crossed braided fusion categories from a given
one by means of cohomological data associated with the invertible objects in
the category and grading group $G$. This is achieved by adapting a similar
construction for (braided) fusion categories recently described by the authors.
All $G$-crossed braided zestings of a given category $\mathcal{C}$ are
$G$-extensions of their trivial component and can be interpreted in terms of
the homotopy-based description of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. In particular,
we explicitly describe which $G$-extensions correspond to $G$-crossed braided
zestings.

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In two-qubit gates activated by microwave pulses, by turning pulse on or off,
the state of qubits are swapped between entangled or idle modes. In either
mode, the presence of stray couplings makes qubits accumulate coherent phase
error. However, the error rates in the two modes differ because qubits carry
different stray coupling strengths in each mode; therefore, eliminating stray
coupling from one mode does not remove it from the other. We propose to combine
such a gate with a tunable coupler and show that both idle and entangled qubits
can become free from stray couplings. This significantly increases the
operational switch fidelity in quantum algorithms. We further propose a
weakly-tunable qubit as an optimum coupler to bring the two modes
parametrically near each other. This remarkably enhances the tuning process by
reducing its leakage.

					<dc:description>  The exploration of mutual-benefit cross-domains has shown great potential
toward accurate self-supervised depth estimation. In this work, we revisit
feature fusion between depth and semantic information and propose an efficient
local adaptive attention method for geometric aware representation enhancement.
Instead of building global connections or deforming attention across the
feature space without restraint, we bound the spatial interaction within a
learnable region of interest. In particular, we leverage geometric cues from
semantic information to learn local adaptive bounding boxes to guide
unsupervised feature aggregation. The local areas preclude most irrelevant
reference points from attention space, yielding more selective feature learning
and faster convergence. We naturally extend the paradigm into a multi-head and
hierarchic way to enable the information distillation in different semantic
levels and improve the feature discriminative ability for fine-grained depth
estimation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our proposed
method establishes a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised monocular depth
estimation task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach over former
Transformer variants.

					<dc:description>  The stabilization and manipulation of laser frequency by means of an external
cavity are nearly ubiquitously used in fundamental research and laser
applications. While most of the laser light transmits through the cavity, in
the presence of some back-scattered light from the cavity to the laser, the
self-injection locking effect can take place, which locks the laser emission
frequency to the cavity mode of similar frequency. The self-injection locking
leads to dramatic reduction of laser linewidth and noise. Using this approach,
a common semiconductor laser locked to an ultrahigh-$Q$ microresonator can
obtain sub-hertz linewidth, on par with state-of-the-art fiber lasers.
Therefore it paves the way to manufacture high-performance semiconductor lasers
with reduced footprint and cost. Moreover, with high laser power, the optical
nonlinearity of the microresonator drastically changes the laser dynamics,
offering routes for simultaneous pulse and frequency comb generation in the
same microresonator. Particularly, integrated photonics technology, enabling
components fabricated via semiconductor CMOS process, has brought increasing
and extending interest to laser manufacturing using this method. In this
article, we present a comprehensive tutorial on analytical and numerical
methods of laser self-injection locking, as well a review of most recent
theoretical and experimental achievements.

					<dc:description>  In this work, our focus is on exploring the potential of current GRB
measurements to provide reliable constraints on cosmological model parameters
at high redshift. This work is divided into two parts. First, we calibrate the
Amati relation in a model-independent way by using Hubble parameter
measurements obtained from the differential age of the galaxies. We further
check if the Amati relation parameters evolve with the GRBs' redshift or not.
For this, we divide the GRBs into five different redshift bins. The results
indicate that GRBs do seem to evolve with redshift. In the second part, we test
different cosmological models with the calibrated GRB data. Our results
indicate that the present quality of GRB data is not good enough to put tight
constraints on the cosmological parameters. Hence we perform a joint analysis
with the combined data of GRBs and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and find that this
can considerably enhance cosmological constraints in contrast to solely relying
on GRBs.

based SGD approaches) in combination with batch clipping, which clips an
aggregate of computed gradients rather than summing clipped gradients (as is
done in individual clipping). The framework also admits sampling techniques
beyond random subsampling such as shuffling. Our DP analysis follows the $f$-DP
approach and introduces a new proof technique based on a slightly {\em
stronger} adversarial model which allows us to derive simple closed form
expressions and to also analyse group privacy. In particular, for $E$ epochs
work and groups of size $g$, we show a $\sqrt{g E}$ DP dependency for batch
clipping with shuffling.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel deep neural network architecture for solving
the inverse scattering problem in frequency domain with wide-band data, by
directly approximating the inverse map, thus avoiding the expensive
optimization loop of classical methods. The architecture is motivated by the
filtered back-projection formula in the full aperture regime and with
homogeneous background, and it leverages the underlying equivariance of the
problem and compressibility of the integral operator. This drastically reduces
the number of training parameters, and therefore the computational and sample
complexity of the method. In particular, we obtain an architecture whose number
of parameters scale sub-linearly with respect to the dimension of the inputs,
while its inference complexity scales super-linearly but with very small
constants. We provide several numerical tests that show that the current
approach results in better reconstruction than optimization-based techniques
such as full-waveform inversion, but at a fraction of the cost while being
competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

					<dc:description>  We provide an overview of the string landscape and the Swampland program. Our
review of the string landscape covers the worldsheet and spacetime
perspectives, including vacua and string dualities. We then review and motivate
the Swampland program from the lessons learned from the string landscape. These
lecture notes are aimed to be self-contained and thus can serve as a starting
point for researchers interested in exploring these ideas.
  These notes are an expanded version of two courses &quot;The String Landscape and
the Swampland&quot; taught by C.~Vafa at Harvard University in 2018 with a focus on
the landscape, written by M.~J.~Kang with additional material from N.~B.~Agmon,
and in 2022 with a focus on the Swampland, written by A.~Bedroya.

					<dc:description>  Given an arbitrary choice of two sets of nonzero Boltzmann weights for
$n$-color lattice models, we provide explicit algebraic conditions on these
Boltzmann weights which guarantee a solution (i.e., a third set of weights) to
the Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore we provide an explicit one-dimensional
parametrization of all solutions in this case. These $n$-color lattice models
are so named because their admissible vertices have adjacent edges labeled by
one of $n$ colors with additional restrictions. The two-colored case
specializes to the six-vertex model, in which case our results recover the
familiar quadric condition of Baxter for solvability. The general $n$-color
case includes important solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation like the
evaluation modules for the quantum affine Lie algebra
$U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$. Finally, we demonstrate the invariance of this
class of solutions under natural transformations, including those associated
with Drinfeld twisting.

					<dc:description>  We present an ab initio method for eletcronic structure calculations, which
accounts for the interaction of electrons and magnons in ferromagnets. While it
is based on a many body perturbation theory we approximate numerically complex
quantities with quantities from time dependent density functional theory. This
results in a simple and affordable algorithm which allows us to consider more
complex materials than those usually studied in this context ($3d$
ferromagnets) while still being able to account for the non-locality of the
self energy. Furthermore, our approach allows for a relatively simple way to
incorporate self-consistency. Our results are in a good agreement with
experimental and theoretical findings for iron and nickel. Especially the
experimental exchange splitting of nickel is predicted accurately within our
theory. Additionally, we study the halfmetallic ferromagnet NiMnSb concerning
its non-qusiparticle states appearing in the bandgap due to spin-flip
excitations.

					<dc:title>Could Buchdahl star be a Virial star ?</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Dadhich, Naresh</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Buchdahl star is the most compact object without horizon and it is defined by
the potential $\Phi(R) = 4/9$ and black hole by $\Phi(R) = 1/2$, where $\Phi(R)
= (MR-Q^2/2)/(R^2+a^2)$ for Kerr-Newman charged and rotating object. It turns
out that in terms of gravitational and non-gravitational energy, the former is
defined when gravitational energy is half of non-gravitational energy while the
latter when the two are equal. If an infinitely dispersed system of bare mass
$M$ collapses under its own gravity to radius $R$, total energy inside would be
$E_{tot}(R)=M-E_{grav}(R)$. That is, energy inside is increased by the amount
equivalent to gravitational energy which may manifest as internal or binding
energy. If the interior consists of free particles in motion interacting only
through gravity (as is the case for Vlasov kinetic matter), then internal
(gravitational) energy would be kinetic energy and the defining condition for
Buchdahl star would be kinetic energy equal to half of non-gravitational
(potential) energy. It could then be construed that equilibrium of Buchdahl
star interior is governed by the celebrated Virial theorem (kinetic energy
equal to half of potential energy). Thus it could be thought of as a Virial
star.

					<dc:description>  Recent years have seen progress beyond domain-specific sound separation for
speech or music towards universal sound separation for arbitrary sounds. Prior
work on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound
out of an audio mixture given a text query. Such text-queried sound separation
systems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary
target sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems
require costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio
provided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment,
causing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this
work, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only
unlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn
the desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first
encodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to
condition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the
model is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test
time we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting,
thanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model.
Further, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background
noise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual
correspondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called
noise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on
noisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully
learn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled
videos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in
some settings.

					<dc:description>  We develop the BRST approach to construct the general off-shell local Lorentz
covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massive higher spin fields
on $d$-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider two different cases for
interacting higher spin fields: with one massive and two massless; with two
massive both with coinciding and with different masses and one massless fields
of spins $s_1, s_2, s_3$. Unlike the previous results on cubic vertices we
follow our result in [arXiv:2105.12030[hep-th]] for massless fields and use the
complete BRST operator, including the trace constraints that is used to
formulate an irreducible representation with definite integer spin. We
generalize the cubic vertices proposed for reducible higher spin fields in
[arXiv:1205.3131 [hep-th]] in the form of multiplicative and non-multiplicative
BRST-closed constituents and calculate the new contributions to the vertex,
which contain additional terms with a smaller number space-time derivatives of
the fields. We prove that without traceless-closeness conditions for the cubic
vertices in [arXiv:1205.3131 [hep-th]] it is impossible to provide the
noncontradictory Lagrangian dynamics. As the examples, we explicitly construct
the interacting Lagrangian for the massive of spin $s$ field and massless
scalars both with and without auxiliary fields. The interacting models with
different combinations of triples higher spin fields: massive of spin $s$ with
massless scalar and vector fields and with two vector fields; massless of
helicity $\lambda$ with massless scalar and massive vector fields; two massive
fields of spins $s, 0$ and massless scalar are also considered.

					<dc:description>  Recent quasi-2D systems with judicious exploitation of the atomic monolayer
or few-layer architecture exhibit unprecedented physical properties that
challenge the conventional wisdom on the condensed matter physics. Here we show
that the infinite layer SrCuO2 (SCO), a topical cuprate Mott insulator in the
bulk form, can manifest an unexpected metallic state in the quasi-2D limit when
SCO is grown on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. Hard x-ray core-level
photoemission spectra demonstrate a definitive Fermi level that resembles the
hole doped metal. Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy also reveals features
analogous to those of a hole doped Mott insulator. Based on these results, we
conclude that the hole doping does not occur at the interfaces between SCO and
STO; instead, it comes from the transient layers between the chain type and the
planar type structures within the SCO slab. The present work reveals a novel
metallic state in the infinite layer SCO and invites further examination to
elucidate the spatial extent of this state.

					<dc:title>The role of vehicle movement in swine disease dissemination: novel

					<dc:description>  The transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in animal production are
driven by several propagation routes. Contaminated vehicles traveling between
farms have been associated with indirect disease transmission. In this study,
we used transportation vehicle data to analyze the magnitude of farm visits by
different vehicles and to propose a methodology to reconstruct vehicle contact
networks considering pathogen stability and cleaning and disinfection
effectiveness. Here, we collected information from 6,363 farms and Global
Positioning System (GPS) records from 567 vehicles used to transport feed,
animals, and people. We reconstructed vehicle contacts among the farms,
conserving pathogen stability decay and different probabilities of cleaning and
disinfection. Results showed that vehicle movement networks were densely
connected, with up to 86% of farms connected by these movements. Movements of
vehicle transporting feed and pig among farms showed the highest network
connectivity. The cleaning effectiveness of was variable among the different
vehicle types and highly influenced by the frequency of vehicles stopping at
clean stations. A large number of between-farm contacts with a pathogen
stability &gt;0.8 were present in the vehicle network even with 100% cleaning
effectiveness. Finally, we identified that vehicles contacted farms from
different companies. Thus, our results suggest the vehicle network is a
potential mechanism for spreading pathogens among farms. Moreover, even with
scenarios with high effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection, the risk of
vehicles spreading diseases was not completely eliminated.

					<dc:description>  This paper proposes a new 3D gas distribution mapping technique based on the
local message passing of Gaussian belief propagation that is capable of
resolving in real time, concentration estimates in 3D space whilst accounting
for the obstacle information within the scenario, the first of its kind in the
literature. The gas mapping problem is formulated as a 3D factor graph of
Gaussian potentials, the connections of which are conditioned on local
occupancy values. The Gaussian belief propagation framework is introduced as
the solver and a new hybrid message scheduler is introduced to increase the
rate of convergence. The factor graph problem is then redesigned as a
dynamically expanding inference task, coupling the information of consecutive
gas measurements with local spatial structure obtained by the robot. The
proposed algorithm is compared to the state of the art methods in 2D and 3D
simulations and is found to resolve distribution maps orders of magnitude
quicker than typical direct solvers. The proposed framework is then deployed
for the first time onboard a ground robot in a 3D mapping and exploration task.
The system is shown to be able to resolve multiple sensor inputs and output
high resolution 3D gas distribution maps in a GPS denied cluttered scenario in
real time. This online inference of complicated plume structures provides a new
layer of contextual information over its 2D counterparts and enables autonomous
systems to take advantage of real time estimates to inform potential next best
sampling locations.

					<dc:description>  In this study, we propose a dense frequency-time attentive network (DeFT-AN)
for multichannel speech enhancement. DeFT-AN is a mask estimation network that
predicts a complex spectral masking pattern for suppressing the noise and
reverberation embedded in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of an input
signal. The proposed mask estimation network incorporates three different types
of blocks for aggregating information in the spatial, spectral, and temporal
dimensions. It utilizes a spectral transformer with a modified feed-forward
network and a temporal conformer with sequential dilated convolutions. The use
of dense blocks and transformers dedicated to the three different
characteristics of audio signals enables more comprehensive enhancement in
noisy and reverberant environments. The remarkable performance of DeFT-AN over
state-of-the-art multichannel models is demonstrated based on two popular noisy
and reverberant datasets in terms of various metrics for speech quality and
intelligibility.

					<dc:description>  Non-Newtonian fluids have a viscosity that varies with applied stress.
Elastoviscoplastic fluids, the elastic, viscous and plastic properties of which
are interconnected in a non-trivial way, belong to this category. We have
performed numerical simulations to investigate turbulence in elastoviscoplastic
fluids at very high Reynolds-number values, as found in landslides and lava
flows, focusing on the effect of plasticity. We find that the range of active
scales in the energy spectrum reduces when increasing the fluid plasticity;
when plastic effects dominate, a new scaling range emerges between the inertial
range and the dissipative scales. An extended self-similarity analysis of the
structure functions reveals that intermittency is present and grows with the
fluid plasticity. The enhanced intermittency is caused by the non-Newtonian
dissipation rate, which also exhibits an intermittent behaviour. These findings
have relevance to catastrophic events in natural flows, such as landslides and
lava flows, where the enhanced intermittency results in stronger extreme
events, which are thus more destructive and difficult to predict.

					<dc:description>  We calculate the ground states of a dipolar Bose gas confined in an infinite
tube potential. We use the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation theory and
present a novel numerical method to efficiently obtain solutions. A key feature
of this method is an analytic result for a truncated dipole-dipole interaction
potential that enables the long-ranged interactions to be accurately evaluated
within a unit cell. Our focus is on the transition of the ground state to a
crystal driven by dipole-dipole interactions as the short ranged interaction
strength is varied. We find that the transition is continuous or discontinuous
depending upon average system density. These results give deeper insight into
the supersolid phase transition observed in recent experiments, and validate
the utility of the reduced three-dimensional theory developed in [Phys. Rev.
Res. 2, 043318 (2020)] for making qualitatively accurate predictions.

					<dc:description>  The nonlinear dynamics of circularly polarized dispersive Alfv{\'e}n wave
(AW) envelopes coupled to the driven ion sound waves of plasma slow response is
studied in a uniform magnetoplasma. By restricting the wave dynamics to a few
number of harmonic modes, a low-dimensional dynamical model is proposed to
describe the nonlinear wave-wave interactions. It is found that two
subintervals of the wave number of modulation $k$ of AW envelope exists, namely
$(3/4)k_c&lt;k&lt;k_c$ and $0&lt;k&lt;(3/4)k_c$, where $k_c$ is the critical value of $k$
below which the modulational instability (MI) occurs. In the former, where the
MI growth rate is low, the periodic and/or quasi-periodic states are shown to
occur, whereas the latter, where the MI growth is high, brings about the
chaotic states. The existence of these states is established by the analyses of
Lyapunov exponent spectra together with the bifurcation diagram and phase-space
portraits of dynamical variables. Furthermore, the complexities of chaotic
phase spaces in the nonlinear motion are measured by the estimations of the
correlation dimension (CD) as well as the approximate entropy (ApEn), and
compared with those for the known H{\'e}non map and the Lorenz system in which
a good qualitative agreement is noted. The chaotic motion thus predicted in a
low-dimensional model can be a prerequisite for the onset of Alfv{\'e}nic wave
turbulence to be observed in a higher dimensional model that and is relevant in
the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.

					<dc:description>  Gravitationally bound clumps of dark matter axions in the form of
'miniclusters' or even denser 'axion stars' can generate strong radio signals
through axion-photon conversion when encountering highly magnetised neutron
star magnetospheres. We systematically study encounters of axion clumps with
neutron stars and characterise the axion infall, conversion and the subsequent
propagation of the photons. We show that the high density and low escape
velocity of the axion clumps lead to strong, narrow, and temporally
characteristic transient radio lines with an expected duration varying from
seconds to months. Our work comprises the first end-to-end modeling pipeline
capable of characterizing the radio signal generated during these transient
encounters, quantifying the typical brightness, anisotropy, spectral width, and
temporal evolution of the radio flux. The methods developed here may prove
essential in developing dedicated radio searches for transient radio lines
arising from miniclusters and axion stars.

					<dc:subject>Physics - Optics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The optical lever is a centuries old and widely-used detection technique
employed in applications ranging from consumer products, industrial sensors to
precision force microscopes used in scientific research. However, despite the
long history, its quantum limits have yet to be explored. In general, any
precision optical measurement is accompanied by optical force induced
disturbance to the measured object (termed as back action) leading to a
standard quantum limit(SQL). Here we give a simple ray optics description of
how such back action can be evaded in optical lever detection to beat SQL. We
perform a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the mechanism of back
action evasion in the classical regime, by developing a lens system that
cancels extra tilting of the reflected light off a silicon nitride membrane
mechanical resonator caused by laser-pointing-noise-induced optical torques. We
achieve a readout noise floor two orders of magnitude lower than the SQL,
corresponding to an effective optomechanical cooperativity of 100 without the
need for an optical cavity. As the state-of-the-art ultra low dissipation
optomechanical systems relevant for quantum sensing are rapidly approaching the
level where quantum noise dominates, simple and widely applicable back action
evading protocols will be crucial for pushing beyond quantum limits.

					<dc:description>  To ensure proper knowledge representation of the kitchen environment, it is
vital for kitchen robots to recognize the states of the food items that are
being cooked. Although the domain of object detection and recognition has been
extensively studied, the task of object state classification has remained
relatively unexplored. The high intra-class similarity of ingredients during
different states of cooking makes the task even more challenging. Researchers
have proposed adopting Deep Learning based strategies in recent times, however,
they are yet to achieve high performance. In this study, we utilized the
self-attention mechanism of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for the
Cooking State Recognition task. The proposed approach encapsulates the globally
salient features from images, while also exploiting the weights learned from a
larger dataset. This global attention allows the model to withstand the
similarities between samples of different cooking objects, while the employment
of transfer learning helps to overcome the lack of inductive bias by utilizing
pretrained weights. To improve recognition accuracy, several augmentation
techniques have been employed as well. Evaluation of our proposed framework on
the `Cooking State Recognition Challenge Dataset' has achieved an accuracy of
94.3%, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

					<dc:description>  Handwriting Recognition has been a field of great interest in the Artificial
Intelligence domain. Due to its broad use cases in real life, research has been
conducted widely on it. Prominent work has been done in this field focusing
mainly on Latin characters. However, the domain of Arabic handwritten character
recognition is still relatively unexplored. The inherent cursive nature of the
Arabic characters and variations in writing styles across individuals makes the
task even more challenging. We identified some probable reasons behind this and
proposed a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network-based architecture for
recognizing Arabic characters and digits. The proposed pipeline consists of a
total of 18 layers containing four layers each for convolution, pooling, batch
normalization, dropout, and finally one Global average pooling and a Dense
layer. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigated the different choices of
hyperparameters such as the choice of the optimizer, kernel initializer,
activation function, etc. Evaluating the proposed architecture on the publicly
available 'Arabic Handwritten Character Dataset (AHCD)' and 'Modified Arabic
handwritten digits Database (MadBase)' datasets, the proposed model
respectively achieved an accuracy of 96.93% and 99.35% which is comparable to
the state-of-the-art and makes it a suitable solution for real-life end-level
applications.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we study the effect of a high-precision semianalytical mass
function on the merger rate of primordial black holes (PBHs) in dark matter
halos. For this purpose, we first explain a theoretical framework for dark
matter halo models and introduce relevant quantities such as halo density
profile, concentration parameter, and a high-precision semianalytical function
namely Del Popolo (DP) mass function. In the following, we calculate the merger
rate of PBHs in the framework of ellipsoidal-collapse dark matter halo models
while considering the DP mass function, and compare it with our previous study
for the Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass function. The results show that by taking the
mass of PBHs as $M_{\rm PBH} = 30M_{\odot}$, the DP mass function can
potentially amplify the merger rate of PBHs. Moreover, we calculate the merger
rate of PBHs for the DP mass function as a function of their mass and fraction
and compare it with the black hole mergers recorded by the LIGO-Virgo detectors
during the latest observing run. Our findings show that the merger rate of PBHs
will fall within the LIGO-Virgo band if $f_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This implies that the DP mass function can be used to
strengthen constraints on the fraction of PBHs.

					<dc:description>  Transient bonds between fast linkers and slower particles are widespread in
physical and biological systems. In spite of their diverse structure and
function, a commonality is that the linkers diffuse on timescales much faster
compared to the overall motion of the particles they bind to. This limits
numerical and theoretical approaches that need to resolve these diverse
timescales with high accuracy. Many models, therefore, resort to effective, yet
ad-hoc, dynamics, where linker motion is only accounted for when bound. This
paper provides a mathematical justification for such coarse-grained dynamics
that preserves detailed balance at equilibrium. Our derivation is based on
multiscale averaging techniques and is broadly applicable. We verify our
results with simulations on a minimal model of fast linker binding to a slow
particle. We show how our framework can be applied to various systems,
including those with multiple linkers, stiffening linkers upon binding, or slip
bonds with force-dependent unbinding. Importantly, the preservation of detailed
balance only sets the ratio of the binding to the unbinding rates, but it does
not constrain the detailed expression of binding kinetics. We conclude by
discussing how various choices of binding kinetics may affect macroscopic
dynamics.

					<dc:description>  Graph neural networks (GNNs), as the de-facto model class for representation
learning on graphs, are built upon the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
architecture with additional message passing layers to allow features to flow
across nodes. While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs
to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause
of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the
major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization
capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as
P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then
adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs
consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while
being much more efficient in training. This finding provides a new perspective
for understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic
tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems including
expressivity, generalization, over-smoothing and heterophily. As an initial
step to analyze PMLP, we show its essential difference to MLP at infinite-width
limit lies in the NTK feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, through
extrapolation analysis (i.e., generalization under distribution shifts), we
find that though most GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot extrapolate
non-linear functions for extreme out-of-distribution data, they have greater
potential to generalize to testing data near the training data support as
natural advantages of the GNN architecture used for inference.

					<dc:description>  Fine-grained semantic segmentation of a person's face and head, including
facial parts and head components, has progressed a great deal in recent years.
However, it remains a challenging task, whereby considering ambiguous
occlusions and large pose variations are particularly difficult. To overcome
these difficulties, we propose a novel framework termed Mask-FPAN. It uses a
de-occlusion module that learns to parse occluded faces in a semi-supervised
way. In particular, face landmark localization, face occlusionstimations, and
detected head poses are taken into account. A 3D morphable face model combined
with the UV GAN improves the robustness of 2D face parsing. In addition, we
introduce two new datasets named FaceOccMask-HQ and CelebAMaskOcc-HQ for face
paring work. The proposed Mask-FPAN framework addresses the face parsing
problem in the wild and shows significant performance improvements with MIOU
from 0.7353 to 0.9013 compared to the state-of-the-art on challenging face
datasets.

					<dc:description>  The task of locating and classifying different types of vehicles has become a
vital element in numerous applications of automation and intelligent systems
ranging from traffic surveillance to vehicle identification and many more. In
recent times, Deep Learning models have been dominating the field of vehicle
detection. Yet, Bangladeshi vehicle detection has remained a relatively
unexplored area. One of the main goals of vehicle detection is its real-time
application, where `You Only Look Once' (YOLO) models have proven to be the
most effective architecture. In this work, intending to find the best-suited
YOLO architecture for fast and accurate vehicle detection from traffic images
in Bangladesh, we have conducted a performance analysis of different variants
of the YOLO-based architectures such as YOLOV3, YOLOV5s, and YOLOV5x. The
models were trained on a dataset containing 7390 images belonging to 21 types
of vehicles comprising samples from the DhakaAI dataset, the Poribohon-BD
dataset, and our self-collected images. After thorough quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we found the YOLOV5x variant to be the best-suited model,
performing better than YOLOv3 and YOLOv5s models respectively by 7 &amp; 4 percent
in mAP, and 12 &amp; 8.5 percent in terms of Accuracy.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we prove the strong and time-averaged strong convergence to
equilibrium for solutions (with general initial data) of the spatially
homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Fermi-Dirac particles. The assumption on the
collision kernel includes the Coulomb potential with a weaker angular cutoff.
The proof is based on moment estimates, entropy dissipation inequalities,
regularity of the collision gain operator, and a new observation that many
collision kernels are larger than or equal to some completely positive kernels,
which enables us to avoid dealing with the convergence problem of the cubic
collision integrals.

					<dc:description>  Energy transfer in small nanosized systems can be very different from that in
their macroscopic counterparts due to reduced dimensionality, interaction with
surfaces, disorder, and large fluctuations. Those ingredients may induce
non-diffusive heat transfer that requires to be taken into account on small
scales. We provide an overview of the recent advances in this field from the
points of view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and atomistic
simulations. We summarize the underlying basic properties leading to violations
of the standard diffusive picture of heat transport and its universal features,
with some historical perspective. We complete this scenario by illustrating
also the effects of long-range interaction and integrability on non-diffusive
transport. Then we discuss how all of these features can be exploited for
thermal management, rectification and to improve the efficiency of energy
conversion. We conclude with a review on recent achievements in atomistic
simulations of anomalous heat transport in single polymers, nanotubes and
two-dimensional materials. A short account of the existing experimental
literature is also given.}

					<dc:description>  In dynamical system theory, the process of obtaining a reduced-order
approximation of the high-order model is called model order reduction. The
closeness of the reduced-order model to the original model is generally gauged
by using system norms of additive or relative error system. The relative error
is a superior criterion to the additive error in assessing accuracy in many
applications like reduced-order controller and filter designs. In this paper,
we propose an oblique projection algorithm that minimizes the H2 norm of the
relative error transfer function. The selection of reduction matrices in the
algorithm is motivated by the necessary conditions for local optima of the
(squared) H2 norm of the relative error transfer function. Numerical simulation
confirms that the proposed algorithm compares well in accuracy with balanced
stochastic truncation while avoiding the solution of large-scale Riccati and
Lyapunov equations.

					<dc:description>  Spin liquid crystals are magnetic analogs of liquid crystals, possessing
properties of both liquids and solids, a typical example of which are spin
nematics. Spin nematics share many features with spin liquids, and the
interplay between them is a promising, but little explored, route to uncovering
new phases of matter. Here, we address this question in the context of a
spin-$1$ magnet on the honeycomb lattice, by considering a model with both
biquadratic interactions, favouring spin-nematic states, and Kitaev-like
interactions, supporting spin liquids. Accompanying these, where dipole and
quadrupole moments compete, we find a plethora of exotic phases, including
multiple-$q$ states with nonzero scalar spin chirality; a quasi-one-dimensional
coplanar phase; a twisted conical phase; and a noncoplanar order state which
gives way to a chiral spin liquid at finite temperature. The implication of
these results for experiment is discussed.

					<dc:description>  The nontrivial spin texture on the (001) surface of topological crystalline
insulator SnTe hosts exotic scientific importance and spintronic applications.
Here, we study the effects of weak Floquet optical driving on the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic
impurities on a doped SnTe(001) surface. Due to peculiar spin-orbit
hybridization, we find a noncollinear twisted RKKY interaction comprising
XYZ-Heisenberg, symmetric in-plane, and asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
terms. We see that contributions from the $z$ ($x$)-component of the
XYZ-Heisenberg (DM) interaction are dominant for most parameters. The
interactions, including DM terms that are responsible for interesting spin
textures, require doping in most cases. We propose to modify the interactions
in situ via optical control of band structure, and thereby doping. A notable
aspect of this control protocol is breaking of electron-hole symmetry, which
stems from the DM interaction.

					<dc:description>  Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is becoming relevant with the growth of
textual data; however, with the popularization of public large-scale datasets,
some recent machine learning approaches have focused on dense models and
architectures that, despite producing notable results, usually turn out in
models difficult to interpret. Given the challenge behind interpretable
learning-based text summarization and the importance it may have for evolving
the current state of the ATS field, this work studies the application of two
modern Generalized Additive Models with interactions, namely Explainable
Boosting Machine and GAMI-Net, to the extractive summarization problem based on
linguistic features and binary classification.

					<dc:description>  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent zero-shot
generalization to new language tasks. However, effective utilization of LLMs
for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily
due to the modality disconnection and task disconnection between LLM and VQA
task. End-to-end training on vision and language data may bridge the
disconnections, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address
this issue, we propose \emph{Img2Prompt}, a plug-and-play module that provides
the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task
disconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end
training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic
models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed
question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA
tasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It can flexibly work with
various LLMs to perform VQA. 2)~Without the needing of end-to-end training, it
significantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for zero-shot VQA tasks. 3) It
achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end
training. For example, we outperform Flamingo \cite{Deepmind:Flamingo2022} by
5.6\% on VQAv2. On the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, our method even outperforms
few-shot methods by as much as 20\%.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the extent to which a two-level quantum system subjected to an
external time-dependent drive can be characterized by supervised learning. We
apply this approach to the case of bang-bang control and the estimation of the
offset and the final distance to a given target state. For any control
protocol, the goal is to find the mapping between the offset and the distance.
This mapping is interpolated using a neural network. The estimate is global in
the sense that no a priori knowledge is required on the relation to be
determined. Different neural network algorithms are tested on a series of data
sets. We show that the mapping can be reproduced with very high precision in
the direct case when the offset is known, while obstacles appear in the
indirect case starting from the distance to the target. We point out the limits
of the estimation procedure with respect to the properties of the mapping to be
interpolated. We discuss the physical relevance of the different results.

					<dc:title>A Classification of Modular Functors via Factorization Homology</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Representation Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Modular functors are traditionally defined as systems of projective
representations of mapping class groups of surfaces that are compatible with
gluing. They can formally be described as modular algebras over central
extensions of the modular surface operad, with the values of the algebra lying
in a suitable symmetric monoidal $(2,1)$-category $\mathcal{S}$ of linear
categories. In this paper, we prove that modular functors in $\mathcal{S}$ are
equivalent to self-dual balanced braided algebras $\mathcal{A}$ in
$\mathcal{S}$ (a categorification of the notion of a commutative Frobenius
algebra) for which a condition formulated in terms of factorization homology
with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfied; we call such $\mathcal{A}$
connected. The equivalence in one direction is afforded by genus zero
restriction. Our construction of the inverse equivalence is entirely
topological and can be thought of as a far reaching generalization of the
construction of modular functors from skein theory. In order to verify the
connectedness condition in practice, we prove that cofactorizability of
$\mathcal{A}$, a condition known to be satisfied for modular categories, is
sufficient. Therefore, we recover in particular Lyubashenko's construction of a
modular functor from a (not necessarily semisimple) modular category and show
that it is determined by its genus zero part. Additionally, we exhibit modular
functors that do not come from modular categories and outline applications to
the theory of vertex operator algebras.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study the impact of neutrino magnetic moments on astrophysical neutrinos,
in particular supernova neutrinos and ultra-high energy neutrinos from
extragalactic sources. We show that magnetic moment-induced conversion of
left-handed neutrinos into unobservable right-handed singlet states can
substantially change the flux and flavour composition of these neutrinos at
Earth. Notably, neutrinos from a supernova's neutronisation burst, whose flux
can be predicted with O(10%) accuracy, offer a discovery reach to neutrino
magnetic moments $\sim \text{few} \times 10^{-13} \mu_B$, up to one order of
magnitude below current limits. For high-energy neutrinos from distant sources,
for which no robust flux prediction exists, we show how the flavour composition
at Earth can be used as a handle to establish the presence of non-negligible
magnetic moments, potentially down to $\text{few} \times 10^{-17} \mu_B$ if the
measurement can be performed on neutrinos from a single source. In both cases,
the sensitivity strongly depends on the galactic resp. intergalactic magnetic
field profiles along the line of sight. Therefore, while a discovery is
possible down to very small values of the magnetic moment, the absence of a
discovery does not imply an equally strong limit. We also comment on the
dependence of our results on the right-handed neutrino mass, paying special
attention to the transition from coherent deflection by a classical magnetic
field to incoherent scattering on individual scattering targets. Finally, we
show that a measurement of Standard Model Dirac neutrino magnetic moments, of
order $10^{-19} \mu_B$, could be possible under rather optimistic, but not
completely outrageous, assumptions using flavour ratios of high-energy
astrophysical neutrinos.

					<dc:description>  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in
various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating
physical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by
minimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of
collocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to
have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the
sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we
propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Learning (FBOAL) method, which
decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based
on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The effectiveness of
FBOAL is demonstrated for non-parameterized and parameterized problems. The
comparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The
numerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of the accuracy and
computational cost of PINNs with FBOAL over the classical PINNs with
non-adaptive collocation points. We also apply FBOAL in a complex industrial
application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields. We show
that FBOAL is able to identify the high-gradient locations and even give better
predictions for some physical fields than the classical PINNs with collocation
points sampled on a pre-adapted finite element mesh built thanks to numerical
expert knowledge. From the present study, it is expected that the use of FBOAL
will help to improve the conventional numerical solver in the construction of
the mesh.

					<dc:description>  An extensive numerical analysis of the scattering and transport properties of
the power-law banded random matrix model (PBRM) at criticality in the presence
of orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic symmetries is presented. Our results
show a good agreement with existing analytical expressions in the metallic
regime and with heuristic relations widely used in studies of the PBRM model in
the presence of orthogonal and unitary symmetries. Moreover, our results
confirm that the multifractal behavior of disordered systems at criticality can
be probed by measuring scattering and transport properties, which is of
paramount importance from the experimental point of view. Thus, a full picture
of the scattering and transport properties of the PBRM model at criticality
corresponding to the three classical Wigner-Dyson ensembles is provided.

					<dc:description>  In this letter, we address the problem of millimeter-Wave channel estimation
in massive MIMO communication systems. Leveraging the sparsity of the mmWave
channel in the beamspace, we formulate the estimation problem as a sparse
signal recovery problem. To this end, we propose a deep learning based
trainable proximal gradient descent network (TPGD-Net). The TPGD-Net unfolds
the iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm into a layer-wise
network, with the gradient descent step size set as a trainable parameter.
Additionally, we replace the proximal operator in the PGD algorithm with a
neural network that exploits data-driven prior channel information to perform
the proximal operation implicitly. To further enhance the transfer of feature
information across layers, we introduce the cross-layer feature attention
fusion module into the TPGD-Net. Our simulation results on the Saleh-Valenzuela
channel model and the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate the superior performance of
TPGD-Net compared to state-of-the-art mmWave channel estimators.

					<dc:description>  A new frequency converter, operating at significantly higher power and
efficiency than previous devices, is described in this paper. The proposed
device is implemented as a klystron structure where a new design principle is
used. New analytical formulas and a specific design procedure are proposed. The
klystron frequency multiplier can be suitable for telecommunications and
non-lethal weapon, scientific and medical particle accelerators while the most
interested exploitations are in the field of high gradient particle
acceleration and FEL devices for which no performant sources exist. The
advanced klystron multiplier can replace all the low level circuitry for
frequency multiplication as a less expensive alternative. Efficiencies in the
range of 60% in the K-band range with power levels of 30 MW are possible
without phase noise, sideband generation, jitter or chirp effects. The
presented design principle is applicable to other bands or power levels.

					<dc:description>  We propose an efficient method to learn both unstructured and structured
sparse neural networks during training, using a novel generalization of the
sparse envelope function (SEF) used as a regularizer, termed {\itshape{group
sparse envelope function}} (GSEF). The GSEF acts as a neuron group selector,
which we leverage to induce structured pruning. Our method receives a
hardware-friendly structured sparsity of a deep neural network (DNN) to
efficiently accelerate the DNN's evaluation. This method is flexible in the
sense that it allows any hardware to dictate the definition of a group, such as
a filter, channel, filter shape, layer depth, a single parameter
(unstructured), etc. By the nature of the GSEF, the proposed method is the
first to make possible a pre-define sparsity level that is being achieved at
the training convergence, while maintaining negligible network accuracy
degradation. We propose an efficient method to calculate the exact value of the
GSEF along with its proximal operator, in a worst-case complexity of $O(n)$,
where $n$ is the total number of groups variables. In addition, we propose a
proximal-gradient-based optimization method to train the model, that is, the
non-convex minimization of the sum of the neural network loss and the GSEF.
Finally, we conduct an experiment and illustrate the efficiency of our proposed
technique in terms of the completion ratio, accuracy, and inference latency.

					<dc:description>  A track-before-detect (TBD) particle filter-based method for detection and
tracking of low observable maneuvering objects based on a sequence of image
frames in the presence of noise and clutter is briefly studied in this short
letter. At each time instance after receiving a frame of image, first, some
preprocessing approaches are applied to the image. Then, it is sent to the
detection and tracking algorithm which is based on a particle filter.
Performance of the approach is evaluated for detection and tracking of an
object in different scenarios including noise and clutter.

					<dc:description>  Polaritonic states arise when a bright optical transition of a molecular
ensemble is resonantly matched to an optical cavity mode frequency. Here, we
lay the groundwork to study the behavior of polaritons in clean, isolated
systems by establishing a new platform for vibrational strong coupling in
gas-phase molecules. We access the strong coupling regime in an intracavity
cryogenic buffer gas cell optimized for the preparation of simultaneously cold
and dense ensembles, and report a proof-of-principle demonstration in gas-phase
methane. We strongly cavity-couple individual rovibrational transitions and
probe a range of coupling strengths and detunings. We reproduce our findings
with classical cavity transmission simulations in the presence of strong
intracavity absorbers. This infrastructure provides a new testbed for benchmark
studies of cavity-altered chemistry.

					<dc:description>  Electrode surface roughness significantly impacts the structure of electric
double layer on a molecular scale. We derive analytical solutions for
differential capacitance (DC) of electric double layer near rough electrode
surface, comparing them with a range of experimental and numerical studies. Two
causes of ions separation are considered: ion size asymmetry and electrode
surface roughness. The model has three scale parameters determining DC
properties: the Debye length, difference of ion penetration depths, and surface
roughness parameter. For the first time, DC profile with more than two peaks
was obtained analytically due to account for ions reorientation effect. The
model predicts DC curve transform from bell to camel and inverse induced by
electrode surface roughness. The behavior of DC-potential relation with
temperature and ion size ratio diverges depending on the type of ions
separation. Additionally, we provide analytical solutions for zero charge
potential and demonstrate roughness effect on its value. Based on the results,
we give recommendations for properties required to design effective electric
double layer capacitors.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we consider two functions related to the arithmetic and
geometric means of element orders of a finite group, showing that certain lower
bounds on such functions strongly affect the group structure. In particular,
for every prime $p$, we prove a sufficient condition for a finite group to be
$p$-nilpotent, that is, a group whose elements of $p'$-order form a normal
subgroup. Moreover, we characterize finite cyclic groups with prescribed number
of prime divisors.

					<dc:description>  We present a Machine Learning (ML) study case to illustrate the challenges of
clinical translation for a real-time AI-empowered echocardiography system with
data of ICU patients in LMICs. Such ML case study includes data preparation,
curation and labelling from 2D Ultrasound videos of 31 ICU patients in LMICs
and model selection, validation and deployment of three thinner neural networks
to classify apical four-chamber view. Results of the ML heuristics showed the
promising implementation, validation and application of thinner networks to
classify 4CV with limited datasets. We conclude this work mentioning the need
for (a) datasets to improve diversity of demographics, diseases, and (b) the
need of further investigations of thinner models to be run and implemented in
low-cost hardware to be clinically translated in the ICU in LMICs. The code and

					<dc:description>  We discuss a Rydberg atom chain with a tunable blockade radius from the gauge
theoretic perspective. When the blockade radius is one lattice spacing, this
system can be formulated in terms of the PXP model, and there is a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising phase transition known to be equivalent to a
confinement-deconfinement transition in a gauge theory, the lattice Schwinger
model. Further increasing the blockade radius, one can add a next-nearest
neighbor (NNN) interaction into the PXP model. We discuss the interpretation of
NNN interaction in terms of the gauge theory and how finite NNN interaction
alters the deconfinement behavior and propose a corresponding experimental
protocol. When the blockade radius reaches two lattice spacing, the model
reduces to the PPXPP model. A novel gauge theory equivalent to the PPXPP model
is formulated, and the phases in the two formulations are delineated. These
results are readily explored experimentally in Rydberg quantum simulators.

					<dc:description>  Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch) is
critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness/safety
for end users. Meanwhile, traditional fuzzing techniques can be hardly
effective for such a challenging domain since the input DL programs need to
satisfy both the input language (e.g., Python) syntax/semantics and the DL API
input/shape constraints for tensor computations.
  To address these limitations, we propose TitanFuzz - the first approach to
directly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for
fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are titanic models trained on billions of code
snippets and can auto-regressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key
insight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL
library APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn both
language syntax/semantics and intricate DL API constraints for valid DL program
generation. More specifically, we use both generative and infilling LLMs (e.g.,
Codex/InCoder) to generate and mutate valid/diverse input DL programs for
fuzzing. Our experimental results demonstrate that TitanFuzz can achieve
30.38%/50.84% higher code coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers on
TensorFlow/PyTorch. Furthermore, TitanFuzz is able to detect 65 bugs, with 41
already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.
  This paper demonstrates that modern titanic LLMs can be leveraged to directly
perform both generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing studied for decades,
while being fully automated, generalizable, and applicable to domains
challenging for traditional approaches (such as DL systems). We hope TitanFuzz
can stimulate more work in this promising direction of LLMs for fuzzing.

over a finite field. These measures play an important role in the Tsfasman-
Vladuts theory of asymptotic zeta-functions defining completely the limit
zeta-function of the family. J.-P.Serre, using results of R.M.Robinson on
conjugate algebraic integers, described the possible set of measures than can
correspond to families of abelian varieties over a finite field. The problem
whether all such measures actually occur was left open. Moreover, Serre
supposed that not all such measures correspond to abelian varieties (for
example, the Lebesgue measure on a segment). Here we settle Serre's problem
proving that Serre conditions are sufficient, and thus describe completely the
set of measures corresponding to abelian varieties.

					<dc:description>  Variational quantum algorithms are tailored to perform within the constraints
of current quantum devices, yet they are limited by performance-degrading
errors. In this study, we consider a noise model that reflects realistic gate
errors inherent to variational quantum algorithms. We investigate the
decoherence of a variationally prepared quantum state due to this noise model,
which causes a deviation from the energy estimation in the variational
approach. By performing a perturbative analysis of optimized circuits, we
determine the noise threshold at which the criteria set by the stability lemma
is met. We assess our findings against the variational quantum approximate
optimization algorithm for $3$-SAT problem instances and unstructured search
with up to $10$ qubits and $30$ layers. Moreover, we show that certain gate
errors have a significantly smaller impact on the coherence of the state,
allowing us to reduce the execution time without compromising performance.

					<dc:description>  Unbiased scene graph generation (USGG) is a challenging task that requires
predicting diverse and heavily imbalanced predicates between objects in an
image. To address this, we propose a novel framework peer learning that uses
predicate sampling and consensus voting (PSCV) to encourage multiple peers to
learn from each other. Predicate sampling divides the predicate classes into
sub-distributions based on frequency, and assigns different peers to handle
each sub-distribution or combinations of them. Consensus voting ensembles the
peers' complementary predicate knowledge by emphasizing majority opinion and
diminishing minority opinion. Experiments on Visual Genome show that PSCV
outperforms previous methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art on SGCls task
with 31.6 mean.

					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we present a formal Fourier analysis (FA) of Picard iteration
for the coupled neutronics/thermal hydraulics (N/TH) problem and derive
theoretical predictions for the spectral radius of Picard iteration for such
coupled calculations as a function of the temperature difference between the
fuel and coolant, temperature coefficients of cross sections (i.e., Doppler
feedback), scattering ratio, and core height. An optimal underrelaxation factor
is also derived based on the Fourier analysis.

					<dc:description>  In a recent work by Schrodi $\textit{et al}$. [Phys. Rev. B. $\textbf{104}$,
L140506 (2021)], the authors find an unconventional superconducting state with
a sign-changing order parameter using the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, including
the first vertex correction. This unconventional solution arises despite using
an isotropic bare electron-phonon coupling in the Hamiltonian. We examine this
claim using hybrid quantum Monte Carlo for a single-band Holstein model with a
cuprate-like noninteracting band structure and identical parameters to Schrodi
$\textit{et al}$.. Our Monte Carlo results for these parameters suggest that
unconventional pairing correlations do not exceed their noninteracting values
at any carrier concentration we have checked. Instead, strong
charge-density-wave correlations persist at the lowest accessible temperatures
for dilute and nearly half-filled bands. Lastly, we present arguments for how
vertex-corrected Migdal-Eliashberg calculation schemes can lead to uncontrolled
results in the presence of Fermi surface nesting.

					<dc:description>  There exist principal $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras for hyperbolic Kac-Moody
Lie algebras. In the case of rank 2 symmetric hyperbolic Kac-Moody Lie
algebras, certain $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras are constructed. These
subalgebras are generalizations of principal $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras. We
show that the rank 2 symmetric hyperbolic Kac-Moody Lie algebras themselves are
irreducibly decomposed under the action of this $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras.
Furthermore, we classify irreducible components of the decomposition. In
particular, we obtain multiplicities of unitary principal series and
complementary series.

					<dc:description>  Deploying reliable deep learning techniques in interdisciplinary applications
needs learned models to output accurate and ({even more importantly})
explainable predictions. Existing approaches typically explicate network
outputs in a post-hoc fashion, under an implicit assumption that faithful
explanations come from accurate predictions/classifications. We have an
opposite claim that explanations boost (or even determine) classification. That
is, end-to-end learning of explanation factors to augment discriminative
representation extraction could be a more intuitive strategy to inversely
assure fine-grained explainability, e.g., in those neuroimaging and
neuroscience studies with high-dimensional data containing noisy, redundant,
and task-irrelevant information. In this paper, we propose such an explainable
geometric deep network dubbed as NeuroExplainer, with applications to uncover
altered infant cortical development patterns associated with preterm birth.
Given fundamental cortical attributes as network input, our NeuroExplainer
adopts a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained
attentions and respective discriminative representations to accurately
recognize preterm infants from term-born infants at term-equivalent age.
NeuroExplainer learns the hierarchical attention-decoding modules under
subject-level weak supervision coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from
domain knowledge regarding brain development. These prior-guided constraints
implicitly maximizes the explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and
stability) in network training, driving the learned network to output detailed
explanations and accurate classifications. Experimental results on the public
dHCP benchmark suggest that NeuroExplainer led to quantitatively reliable
explanation results that are qualitatively consistent with representative
neuroimaging studies.

					<dc:description>  Spin-orbit torques in noncentrosymmetric polycrystalline magnetic
heterostructures are usually described in terms of field-like and damping-like
torques. However, materials with a lower symmetry point group can exhibit
torques whose behavior substantially deviates from the conventional ones. In
particular, based on symmetry arguments it was recently proposed that systems
belonging to the C_{3v} point group display spin-orbit torques that can promote
field-free switching [Liu et al. Nature Nanotechnology 16, 277 (2021)]. In the
present work, we analyze the general form of the torques expected in C3v
crystals using the Invariant Theory. We uncover several new components that
arise from the coexistence of the three-fold rotation and mirror symmetries.
Using both tight binding model and first principles simulations, we show that
these unconventional torque components arise from the onset of trigonal warping
of the Fermi surface and can be as large as the damping-like torque. In other
words, the Fermi surface warping is a key indicator to the onset of field-free
switching in low symmetry crystals.

					<dc:description>  Two geometric phases of mixed quantum states, known as the interferometric
phase and Uhlmann phase, are generalizations of the Berry phase of pure states.
After reviewing the two geometric phases and examining their parallel-transport
conditions, we specify a class of cyclic processes that are compatible with
both conditions and therefore accumulate both phases through their definitions,
respectively. Those processes then facilitate a fair comparison between the two
phases. We present exact solutions of two-level and three-level systems to
contrast the two phases. While the interferometric phase exhibits
finite-temperature transitions only in the three-level system but not the
two-level system, the Uhlmann phase shows finite-temperature transitions in
both cases. Thus, using the two geometric phases as finite-temperature
topological indicators demonstrates the rich physics of topology of mixed
states.

					<dc:description>  Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of
quantum technology and artificial intelligence. This review provides a two-fold
overview of several key approaches that can offer advancements in both the
development of quantum technologies and the power of artificial intelligence.
Among these approaches are quantum-enhanced algorithms, which apply quantum
software engineering to classical information processing to improve keystone
machine learning solutions. In this context, we explore the capability of
hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to improve model generalization and
increase accuracy while reducing computational resources. We also illustrate
how machine learning can be used both to mitigate the effects of errors on
presently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and to understand
quantum advantage via an automatic study of quantum walk processes on graphs.
In addition, we review how quantum hardware can be enhanced by applying machine
learning to fundamental and applied physics problems as well as quantum
tomography and photonics. We aim to demonstrate how concepts in physics can be
translated into practical engineering of machine learning solutions using
quantum software.

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Blind Quantum Computation (BQC) is a delegation computing protocol that
allows a client to utilize a remote quantum server to implement desired quantum
computations while keeping her inputs, outputs, and algorithms private.
However, qubit errors during the quantum computation are important issues that
need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant blind quantum
computation protocol with quantum error-correcting codes to avoid the
accumulation and propagation of qubit errors during the computational process.
We further propose to apply the concatenated codes in the protocol to improve
the error correction performance. More importantly, we quantify the resource
consumption of photon pulses by our optimal level concatenation codes.
Extensive simulation results show that our scheme not only can improve the
preparation efficiency but also reduce quantum resource consumption, which
shows a significant improvement to realize a fault-tolerant BQC.

					<dc:description>  Open-world object detection (OWOD), as a more general and challenging goal,
requires the model trained from data on known objects to detect both known and
unknown objects and incrementally learn to identify these unknown objects. The
existing works which employ standard detection framework and fixed
pseudo-labelling mechanism (PLM) have the following problems: (i) The inclusion
of detecting unknown objects substantially reduces the model's ability to
detect known ones. (ii) The PLM does not adequately utilize the priori
knowledge of inputs. (iii) The fixed selection manner of PLM cannot guarantee
that the model is trained in the right direction. We observe that humans
subconsciously prefer to focus on all foreground objects and then identify each
one in detail, rather than localize and identify a single object
simultaneously, for alleviating the confusion. This motivates us to propose a
novel solution called CAT: LoCalization and IdentificAtion Cascade Detection
Transformer which decouples the detection process via the shared decoder in the
cascade decoding way. In the meanwhile, we propose the self-adaptive
pseudo-labelling mechanism which combines the model-driven with input-driven
PLM and self-adaptively generates robust pseudo-labels for unknown objects,
significantly improving the ability of CAT to retrieve unknown objects.
Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MS-COCO and PASCAL
VOC, show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of all
metrics in the task of OWOD, incremental object detection (IOD) and open-set
detection.

					<dc:description>  We study the possibility of having HDE as the source of inflation in the
frame of $f(R,T)$ gravity theory. The length scale of the energy density is
taken as the GO cutoff, which is a combination of the Hubble parameter and its
time derivative. It is found that for a specific range of the free parameters
of the model, the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio stand in
good agreement with data. Also, by reconstructing the potential in terms of the
scalar field, the validity of the swampland criteria is considered. The results
indicate that to have a scalar field below the Planck mass, the parameter
$\lambda$ should be at least of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$. The same
order of $\lambda$ is required to keep the gradient of the potential greater
than one and satisfy the second conjecture of the swampland criteria.

					<dc:description>  Gravitational waves (GWs) from tens of millions of compact binaries in our
Milky Way enter the milli-Hertz band of space-based detection. The majority of
them cannot be resolved individually, resulting in a foreground confusion noise
for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The concept of Taiji mission is
similar to LISA's with slightly better sensitivity, which means that the
galactic GW signals will also affect the detection with Taiji. Here we generate
the GW signals from 29.8 million galactic binaries for Taiji and subtract the
`resolvable' sources. The confusion noise is estimated and fitted in an
analytic form with 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 4-year observation time. We find
that the full sensitivity curve is slightly lower for Taiji than for LISA at
frequencies of $\leq 0.8$ mHz and around 2~mHz. For a 4-year lifetime, more
than 29 thousand sources are resolvable with Taiji. Compared to LISA, Taiji can
subtract $\sim 20 \%$ more sources and the distribution of them in our Milky
Way is consistent with that of the resolvable sources with LISA. At frequencies
around 2~mHz or with the chirp masses ranging from $0.2 M_\odot$ to $0.4
M_\odot$, more sources become resolvable with Taiji.

					<dc:title>Dynamic Binary Search Trees: Improved Lower Bounds for the Greedy-Future
  Algorithm</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Binary search trees (BSTs) are one of the most basic and widely used data
structures. The best static tree for serving a sequence of queries (searches)
can be computed by dynamic programming. In contrast, when the BSTs are allowed
to be dynamic (i.e. change by rotations between searches), we still do not know
how to compute the optimal algorithm (OPT) for a given sequence. One of the
candidate algorithms whose serving cost is suspected to be optimal up-to a
(multiplicative) constant factor is known by the name Greedy Future (GF). In an
equivalent geometric way of representing queries on BSTs, GF is in fact
equivalent to another algorithm called Geometric Greedy (GG). Most of the
results on GF are obtained using the geometric model and the study of GG.
Despite this intensive recent fruitful research, the best lower bound we have
on the competitive ratio of GF is $\frac{4}{3}$. Furthermore, it has been
conjectured that the additive gap between the cost of GF and OPT is only linear
in the number of queries. In this paper we prove a lower bound of $2$ on the
competitive ratio of GF, and we prove that the additive gap between the cost of
GF and OPT can be $\Omega(m \cdot \log\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of items
in the tree and $m$ is the number of queries.

					<dc:description>  The existence of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) at small projected
distances on the sky is due to either the presence of multiple, in-spiraling
SMBHs, or to gravitational lensing of a single AGN. Both phenomena allow us to
address important astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, few
kpc-separation multiple AGN are currently known. Recently, the newly-developed
Gaia Multi peak (GMP) method provided numerous new candidate members of these
populations. We present spatially resolved, integral-field spectroscopy of a
sample of four GMP-selected multiple AGNs candidates. In all of these systems,
we detect two or more components with sub-arcsec separations. We find that two
of the systems are dual AGNs, one is either an intrinsic triple or a lensed
dual AGN, while the last system is a chance AGN/star alignment. Our
observations double the number of confirmed multiple AGNs at projected
separations below 7 kpc at z &gt; 0.5, present the first detection of a possible
triple AGN in a single galaxy at z &gt; 0.5, and successfully test the GMP method
as a novel technique to discover previously unknown multiple AGNs.

					<dc:description>  In this work we develop a discretisation method for the Brinkman problem that
is uniformly well-behaved in all regimes (as identified by a local
dimensionless number with the meaning of a friction coefficient) and supports
general meshes as well as arbitrary approximation orders. The method is
obtained combining ideas from the Hybrid High-Order and Discrete de Rham
methods, and its robustness rests on a potential reconstruction and
stabilisation terms that change in nature according to the value of the local
friction coefficient. We derive error estimates that, thanks to the presence of
cut-off factors, are valid across the all regimes and provide extensive
numerical validation.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of protecting a high-value area from
being breached by sheep agents by crafting motions for dog robots. We use
control barrier functions to pose constraints on the dogs' velocities that
induce repulsion in the sheep relative to the high-value area. This paper
extends the results developed in our prior work on the same topic in three
ways. Firstly, we implement and validate our previously developed centralized
herding algorithm on many robots. We show herding of up to five sheep agents
using three dog robots. Secondly, as an extension to the centralized approach,
we develop two distributed herding algorithms, one favoring feasibility while
the other favoring optimality. In the first algorithm, we allocate a unique
sheep to a unique dog, making that dog responsible for herding its allocated
sheep away from the protected zone. We provide feasibility proof for this
approach, along with numerical simulations. In the second algorithm, we develop
an iterative distributed reformulation of the centralized algorithm, which
inherits the optimality (i.e. budget efficiency) from the centralized approach.
Lastly, we conduct real-world experiments of these distributed algorithms and
demonstrate herding of up to five sheep agents using five dog robots.

					<dc:description>  Ensuring fairness is essential for every education system. Machine learning
is increasingly supporting the education system and educational data science
(EDS) domain, from decision support to educational activities and learning
analytics. However, the machine learning-based decisions can be biased because
the algorithms may generate the results based on students' protected attributes
such as race or gender. Clustering is an important machine learning technique
to explore student data in order to support the decision-maker, as well as
support educational activities, such as group assignments. Therefore, ensuring
high-quality clustering models along with satisfying fairness constraints are
important requirements. This chapter comprehensively surveys clustering models
and their fairness in EDS. We especially focus on investigating the fair
clustering models applied in educational activities. These models are believed
to be practical tools for analyzing students' data and ensuring fairness in
EDS.

					<dc:description>  Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have their own advantages
and both have been widely used for dense prediction in multi-task learning
(MTL). Most of the current studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In
this work, we present a novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable
CNN and query-based Transformer for multi-task learning of dense prediction.
Our method, named DeMT, is based on a simple and effective encoder-decoder
architecture (i.e., deformable mixer encoder and task-aware transformer
decoder). First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators:
the channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among
different channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the
spatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to
efficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed
features). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task
interaction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task
interaction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed
features and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding
task-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task
predictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets,
NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and
significantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models
on a variety of metrics. The code are available at

					<dc:description>  Sequential voting rules have been extensively used in parliamentary and
legislative decision making. After observing that the prevalent successive and
the amendment rules fail several fundamental axioms, Horan and Sprumont [2021]
proposed very recently a two-stage sequential rule which satisfies a variety of
desirable properties. This paper examines this rule by investigating the
complexity of Agenda Control, Coalition Manipulation, Possible Winner,
Necessary Winner, and eight standard election control problems. Our study
offers a comprehensive understanding of the complexity landscape of these
problems.

					<dc:description>  Building and maintaining large AI fleets to efficiently support the
fast-growing DL workloads is an active research topic for modern cloud
infrastructure providers. Generating accurate benchmarks plays an essential
role in the design and evaluation of rapidly evoloving software and hardware
solutions in this area. Two fundamental challenges to make this process
scalable are (i) workload representativeness and (ii) the ability to quickly
incorporate changes to the fleet into the benchmarks.
  To overcome these issues, we propose Mystique, an accurate and scalable
framework for production AI benchmark generation. It leverages the PyTorch
execution graph (EG), a new feature that captures the runtime information of AI
models at the granularity of operators, in a graph format, together with their
metadata. By sourcing EG traces from the fleet, we can build AI benchmarks that
are portable and representative. Mystique is scalable, with its lightweight
data collection, in terms of runtime overhead and user instrumentation efforts.
It is also adaptive, as the expressiveness and composability of EG format
allows flexible user control over benchmark creation.
  We evaluate our methodology on several production AI workloads, and show that
benchmarks generated with Mystique closely resemble original AI models, both in
execution time and system-level metrics. We also showcase the portability of
the generated benchmarks across platforms, and demonstrate several use cases
enabled by the fine-grained composability of the execution graph.

					<dc:description>  A distributed coordination method for solving multi-vehicle lane changes for
connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is presented. Existing approaches to
multi-vehicle lane changes are passive and opportunistic as they are
implemented only when the environment allows it. The novel approach of this
paper relies on the role of a facilitator assigned to a CAV. The facilitator
interacts with and modifies the environment to enable lane changes of other
CAVs. Distributed MPC path planners and a distributed coordination algorithm
are used to control the facilitator and other CAVs in a proactive and
cooperative way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
through numerical simulations. In particular, we show enhanced feasibility of a
multi-CAV lane change in comparison to the simultaneous multi-CAV lane change
approach in various traffic conditions generated by using a data-set from
real-traffic scenarios.

					<dc:description>  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been attracting widespread
attentions due to their encouraging performance and powerful generalizations.
However, few work provide a general view to interpret various GCNs and guide
GCNs' designs. In this paper, by revisiting the original GCN, we induce an
interpretable regularizer-centerd optimization framework, in which by building
appropriate regularizers we can interpret most GCNs, such as APPNP, JKNet,
DAGNN, and GNN-LF/HF. Further, under the proposed framework, we devise a
dual-regularizer graph convolutional network (dubbed tsGCN) to capture
topological and semantic structures from graph data. Since the derived learning
rule for tsGCN contains an inverse of a large matrix and thus is
time-consuming, we leverage the Woodbury matrix identity and low-rank
approximation tricks to successfully decrease the high computational complexity
of computing infinite-order graph convolutions. Extensive experiments on eight
public datasets demonstrate that tsGCN achieves superior performance against
quite a few state-of-the-art competitors w.r.t. classification tasks.

					<dc:description>  Borcea and Streinu showed that the upper bound of the number of congruence
classes of a minimally $d$-volume rigid $(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph on $n$
vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ increases exponentially in $n$ and $d$. We show that
this result also holds for triangulations of $\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
and then find a geometrically motivated bound linear in $n$ for bipyramids. By
the methods used to deduce this bound, we show that, in general, global
$d$-volume rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is not a generic property of a
$(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph.

					<dc:subject>28A78, 28A80</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It is shown that vertical projections in the Heisenberg group of sets of
dimension strictly greater than 3 almost surely have positive area. The proof
uses the point-plate incidence method introduced by F\&quot;assler and Orponen, and
also uses a similar approach to a recent maximal inequality of Zahl for fractal
families of tubes. It relies on the endpoint trilinear Kakeya inequality in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. Some related results are given on generic intersections with

					<dc:description>  The role of data in building AI systems has recently been significantly
magnified by the emerging concept of data-centric AI (DCAI), which advocates a
fundamental shift from model advancements to ensuring data quality and
reliability. Although our community has continuously invested efforts into
enhancing data in different aspects, they are often isolated initiatives on
specific tasks. To facilitate the collective initiative in our community and
push forward DCAI, we draw a big picture and bring together three general
missions: training data development, evaluation data development, and data
maintenance. We provide a top-level discussion on representative DCAI tasks and
share perspectives. Finally, we list open challenges to motivate future
exploration.

					<dc:description>  Resource demands of HPC applications vary significantly. However, it is
common for HPC systems to primarily assign resources on a per-node basis to
prevent interference from co-located workloads. This gap between the
coarse-grained resource allocation and the varying resource demands can lead to
HPC resources being not fully utilized. In this study, we analyze the resource
usage and application behavior of NERSC's Perlmutter, a state-of-the-art
open-science HPC system with both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated nodes. Our
one-month usage analysis reveals that CPUs are commonly not fully utilized,
especially for GPU-enabled jobs. Also, around 64% of both CPU and GPU-enabled
jobs used 50% or less of the available host memory capacity. Additionally,
about 50% of GPU-enabled jobs used up to 25% of the GPU memory, and the memory
capacity was not fully utilized in some ways for all jobs. While our study
comes early in Perlmutter's lifetime thus policies and application workload may
change, it provides valuable insights on performance characterization,
application behavior, and motivates systems with more fine-grain resource
allocation.

					<dc:description>  The current fuel moisture content (FMC) subsystems in WRF-SFIRE and its
workflow system WRFx use a time-lag differential equation model with
assimilation of data from FMC sensors on Remote Automated Weather Stations
(RAWS) by the extended augmented Kalman filter. But the quality of the result
is constrained by the limitations of the model and of the Kalman filter. We
observe that the data flow in a system consisting of a model and the Kalman
filter can be interpreted to be the same as the data flow in a recurrent neural
network (RNN). Thus, instead of building more sophisticated models and data
assimilation methods, we want to train a RNN to approximate the dynamics of the
response of the FMC sensor to a time series of environmental data. Because
standard AI approaches did not converge to reasonable solutions, we pre-train
the RNN with special initial weights devised to turn it into a numerical solver
of the differential equation. We then allow the AI training machinery to
optimize the RNN weights to fit the data better. We illustrate the method on an
example of a time series of 10h-FMC from RAWS and weather data from the
Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA).

					<dc:description>  Single Domain Generalization (SDG) tackles the problem of training a model on
a single source domain so that it generalizes to any unseen target domain.
While this has been well studied for image classification, the literature on
SDG object detection remains almost non-existent. To address the challenges of
simultaneously learning robust object localization and representation, we
propose to leverage a pre-trained vision-language model to introduce semantic
domain concepts via textual prompts. We achieve this via a semantic
augmentation strategy acting on the features extracted by the detector
backbone, as well as a text-based classification loss. Our experiments evidence
the benefits of our approach, outperforming by 10% the only existing SDG object
detection method, Single-DGOD [49], on their own diverse weather-driving
benchmark.

					<dc:description>  Belief propagation is a well-studied algorithm for approximating local
marginals of multivariate probability distribution over complex networks, while
tensor network states are powerful tools for quantum and classical many-body
problems. Building on a recent connection between the belief propagation
algorithm and the problem of tensor network contraction, we propose a block
belief propagation algorithm for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks
and approximating the ground state of $2D$ systems. The advantages of our
method are three-fold: 1) the same algorithm works for both finite and infinite
systems; 2) it allows natural and efficient parallelization; 3) given its
flexibility it would allow to deal with different unit cells. As applications,
we use our algorithm to study the $2D$ Heisenberg and transverse Ising models,
and show that the accuracy of the method is on par with state-of-the-art
results.

					<dc:description>  1,3-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene is the primary chromophore of light-harvesting
polyphenylene ethynylene (PPE) dendrimers. It is experimentally known to share
the same absorption spectrum as its pair of diphenylacetylene (aka. tolane)
meta-substituted branches, yet exhibits an unusual Stokes shift of about 2000
cm$^{-1}$ with respect to its band origin (corresponding to the loss of one
vibrational quantum within the antisymmetric acetylenic stretching) in its
emission spectrum. We suggest in the present work the unusual but plausible
involvement of molecular symmetry selection rules in a situation where the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation is far to be valid. Our hypothesis is comforted
with quantum dynamics (MCTDH) simulations of absorption and emission UV-visible
spectra based on quantum chemistry (TD-DFT) data and a diabatic vibronic
coupling Hamiltonian model.

					<dc:description>  The utility of effective model spaces in quantum simulations of
non-relativistic quantum many-body systems is explored in the context of the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model of interacting fermions. We introduce an iterative
hybrid-classical-quantum algorithm, Hamiltonian learning variational quantum
eigensolver (HL-VQE), that simultaneously optimizes an effective Hamiltonian,
thereby rearranging entanglement into the effective model space, and the
associated ground-state wavefunction. HL-VQE is found to provide an exponential
improvement in Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model calculations, compared to a naive
truncation without Hamiltonian learning, throughout a significant fraction of
the Hilbert space. Quantum simulations are performed to demonstrate the HL-VQE
algorithm, using an efficient mapping where the number of qubits scales with
the $\log$ of the size of the effective model space, rather than the particle
number, allowing for the description of large systems with small quantum
circuits. Implementations on IBM's QExperience quantum computers and simulators
for 1- and 2-qubit effective model spaces are shown to provide accurate and
precise results, reproducing classical predictions. This work constitutes a
step in the development of entanglement-driven quantum algorithms for the
description of nuclear systems, that leverages the potential of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We give formulas for individual black hole masses in a merger, by using
Newtonian physics, in terms of the three measured quantities in the detector:
the initial wave frequency $f_1$, the maximum detected frequency (chirp
frequency) $f_2$, and the time elapse $\tau$ between these two frequencies.
Newtonian gravity provides an excellent pedagogical tool to understand the
basic features of the gravitational wave observations, but it must be augmented
with the assumption of gravitational radiation from General Relativity for
accelerated masses. The simplest approach would be to consider a binary system
of two non-spinning masses (two black holes) circling around their common
center of mass. All the computations can be done within Newtonian physics, but
the General Relativistic formula for the power carried by gravitational waves
is required in this scheme. It turns out there is a subtle point: for the
consistency of the this simple, yet pedagogical computation, taking the lowest
order power formula from General Relativity leads to complex individual masses.
Here we remedy this problem and show a way to write down an average power
formula coming from perturbative General Relativity.

					<dc:description>  Assessing the trustworthiness of information online is complicated.
Literacy-based paradigms are both widely used to help and widely critiqued. We
conducted a study with 35 Gen Zers from across the U.S. to understand how they
assess information online. We found that they tended to encounter -- rather
than search for -- information, and that those encounters were shaped more by
social motivations than by truth-seeking queries. For them, information
processing is fundamentally a social practice. Gen Zers interpreted online
information together, as aspirational members of social groups. Our
participants sought information sensibility: a socially-informed awareness of
the value of information encountered online. We outline key challenges they
faced and practices they used to make sense of information. Our findings
suggest that like their information sensibility practices, solutions and
strategies to address misinformation should be embedded in social contexts
online.

					<dc:description>  As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow
prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in
traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal
dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN)
models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem.
However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction:
i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the
ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider
short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial
dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of
traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To
this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range
transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction.
Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic
spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to
highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a
traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower
PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial
information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world
public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve
state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational
efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map
to make our model highly interpretable.

					<dc:description>  Hybrid digital/analog architecture and low-resolution
analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs /DACs) are two low-cost
implementations for large-scale millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. In this
paper, we investigate the problem of constant-envelope transmit beamforming for
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system, where the
transmit array adopts a hybrid digital/analog architecture with a small number
of RF chains and the receive array adopts a fully digital architecture with
low-resolution ADCs. We derive the relative entropy between the probability
density functions associated with the two test hypotheses under low-resolution
ADCs. We formulate our optimization problem by maximizing the relative entropy,
subject to the constant envelope and orthogonality constraints. To suboptimally
solve the resultant problem, a two-stage framework is developed. In the first
stage, we optimize the transmit power at the directions of the target and
clutter. In the second stage, an efficient iterative algorithm based on
majorization-minimization is presented to obtain the constant-envelope
beamformer according to the attained transmit power. Specifically, we apply a
quadratic function as the minorizer, leading to a low-complexity solution at
each iteration. In addition, to further facilitate low-cost implementation of
the constant-envelope beamformer, we consider the problem of one-bit
beamforming design and propose an efficient iterative method based on the
Nesterov-like gradient method to solve it. Numerical simulations are provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

					<dc:description>  We explicitly solve the equations for the propagation of an electromagnetic
wave up to the subleading order geometric optics expansion in the Kerr
spacetime. This is done in two nontrivial steps. We first construct a set of
parallel propagated null tetrad in Kerr spacetime. Two of the components of
such tetrad give the propagation and polarization of an electromagnetic wave in
geometric optics approximation. Then we use the parallel propagated tetrad to
solve the modified trajectory equation in Kerr spacetime. We obtain the
wavelength-dependent deviation of the trajectory of electromagnetic waves,
which gives the mathematical description of the gravitational spin Hall effect
in Kerr spacetime.

					<dc:description>  The discovery of gravitational waves from merging binary black holes has
generated considerable interest in examining whether these black holes could
have a primordial origin. If a significant number of black holes have to be
produced in the early universe, the primordial scalar power spectrum should
have an enhanced amplitude on small scales, when compared to the COBE
normalized values on the larger scales that is strongly constrained by the
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. In the inflationary scenario
driven by a single, canonical scalar field, such power spectra can be achieved
in models that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll inflation during which
the first slow roll parameter decreases exponentially. In this review, we shall
consider a handful of such inflationary models as well as a reconstructed
scenario and examine the extent of formation of primordial black holes and the
generation of secondary gravitational waves in these cases. We shall also
discuss the strength and shape of the scalar bispectrum and the associated
non-Gaussianity parameter that arise in such situations. We shall conclude with
an outlook wherein we discuss the wider implications of the increased strengths
of the non-Gaussianities on smaller scales.

					<dc:description>  What will happen when unsupervised learning meets diffusion models for
real-world image deraining? To answer it, we propose RainDiffusion, the first
unsupervised image deraining paradigm based on diffusion models. Beyond the
traditional unsupervised wisdom of image deraining, RainDiffusion introduces
stable training of unpaired real-world data instead of weakly adversarial
training. RainDiffusion consists of two cooperative branches: Non-diffusive
Translation Branch (NTB) and Diffusive Translation Branch (DTB). NTB exploits a
cycle-consistent architecture to bypass the difficulty in unpaired training of
standard diffusion models by generating initial clean/rainy image pairs. DTB
leverages two conditional diffusion modules to progressively refine the desired
output with initial image pairs and diffusive generative prior, to obtain a
better generalization ability of deraining and rain generation. Rain-Diffusion
is a non adversarial training paradigm, serving as a new standard bar for
real-world image deraining. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of
our RainDiffusion over un/semi-supervised methods and show its competitive
advantages over fully-supervised ones.

					<dc:description>  The rate of dilepton emission from a magnetized hot hadronic medium is
calculated in the framework of real time formalism of finite temperature field
theory. We evaluate the one loop self-energy of neutral rho-meson containing
thermo-magnetic propagators for the charged pions in the loop. The in-medium
thermo-magnetic spectral function of rho obtained by solving the
Dyson-Schwinger equation is shown to be proportional to the dilepton production
rate. The study of the analytic structure of the neutral rho-meson spectral
function in such a medium shows that in addition to the usual contribution
coming from the Unitary cut beyond the two-pion threshold there is a
non-trivial yield in the low invariant mass region originating due to the fact
that the charged pions occupy different Landau levels before and after
scattering with the neutral rho-meson and is purely a finite magnetic field
effect.

					<dc:description>  Federated Averaging (FedAvg) remains the most popular algorithm for Federated
Learning (FL) optimization due to its simple implementation, stateless nature,
and privacy guarantees combined with secure aggregation. Recent work has sought
to generalize the vanilla averaging in FedAvg to a generalized gradient descent
step by treating client updates as pseudo-gradients and using a server step
size. While the use of a server step size has been shown to provide performance
improvement theoretically, the practical benefit of the server step size has
not been seen in most existing works. In this work, we present FedExP, a method
to adaptively determine the server step size in FL based on dynamically varying
pseudo-gradients throughout the FL process. We begin by considering the
overparameterized convex regime, where we reveal an interesting similarity
between FedAvg and the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm. We then
show how FedExP can be motivated as a novel extension to the extrapolation
mechanism that is used to speed up POCS. Our theoretical analysis later also
discusses the implications of FedExP in underparameterized and non-convex
settings. Experimental results show that FedExP consistently converges faster
than FedAvg and competing baselines on a range of realistic FL datasets.

					<dc:description>  In light of newly developed standardization methods, we evaluate, via
simulation study, how inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and
standardization-based approaches compare for obtaining estimates of the
marginal odds-ratio and the marginal hazards ratio. Specifically, we consider
how the two approaches compare in two different scenarios: (1) in a single
comparative study (either randomized or non-randomized), and (2) in an anchored
indirect treatment comparison of randomized controlled trials (where we compare
the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and simulated treatment
comparison (STC) methods). We conclude that, in general, standardization-based
methods with correctly specified outcome models are more efficient than those
based on IPTW. While IPTW is robust to model misspecification in a single
comparative study, we find that this is not necessarily the case for MAIC in an
indirect treatment comparison.

					<dc:description>  Quantum thermal machines can perform useful tasks, such as delivering power,
cooling, or heating. In this work, we consider hybrid thermal machines, that
can execute more than one task simultaneously. We characterize and find optimal
working conditions for a three-terminal quantum thermal machine, where the
working medium is a quantum harmonic oscillator, coupled to three heat baths,
with two of the couplings driven periodically in time. We show that it is
possible to operate the thermal machine efficiently, in both pure and hybrid
modes, and to switch between different operational modes simply by changing the
driving frequency. Moreover, the proposed setup can also be used as a
high-performance transistor, in terms of output--to--input signal and
differential gain. Due to its versatility and tunability, our model may be of
interest for engineering thermodynamic tasks and for thermal management in
quantum technologies.

					<dc:description>  We present a comprehensive examination of interstellar P and Cl abundances
based on an analysis of archival spectra acquired with the Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer. Column densities of P II, Cl I, and Cl II are
determined for a combined sample of 107 sight lines probing diffuse atomic and
molecular gas in the local Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We reevaluate
the nearly linear relationship between the column densities of Cl I and H$_2$,
which arises from the rapid conversion of Cl$^+$ to Cl$^0$ in regions where
H$_2$ is abundant. Using the observed total gas-phase P and Cl abundances, we
derive depletion parameters for these elements, adopting the methodology of
Jenkins. We find that both P and Cl are essentially undepleted along sight
lines showing the lowest overall depletions. Increasingly severe depletions of
P are seen along molecule-rich sight lines. In contrast, gas-phase Cl
abundances show no systematic variation with molecular hydrogen fraction.
However, enhanced Cl (and P) depletion rates are found for a subset of sight
lines showing elevated levels of Cl ionization. An analysis of neutral chlorine
fractions yields estimates for the amount of atomic hydrogen associated with
the H$_2$-bearing gas in each direction. These results indicate that the
molecular fraction in the H$_2$-bearing gas is at least 10% for all sight lines
with $\log N({\rm H}_2)\gtrsim18$ and that the gas is essentially fully
molecular at $\log N({\rm H}_2)\approx21$.

					<dc:description>  Bosonic encoding is an approach for quantum information processing, promising
lower hardware overhead by encoding in the many levels of a harmonic oscillator
mode. Scaling to multiple modes requires weak interaction for independent
control, yet strong interaction for fast control. Applying fast and efficient
universal control on multiple modes remains an open problem. We show that
universal control of multiple modes can be obtained with displacements of the
different modes conditioned only on a single qubit ancilla. We develop the
conditional not displacement control method which enables fast generation and
control of bosonic states in multi-mode systems weakly coupled to a single
ancilla qubit. Our method is fast despite the weak ancilla coupling. The weak
coupling in turn allows for excellent separability and thus independent
control. We demonstrate our control on a superconducting transmon qubit weakly
coupled to a multi-mode superconducting cavity. We create both entangled and
separable cat-states in different modes of the multi-mode cavity, showing
entangling operations while control of each mode is independent of the state of
the other mode. We show that the operation time is not limited by the inverse
of the coupling rate, which is the typical timescale, and we exceed it by
almost 2 orders of magnitude. Our scheme allows for fast and efficient
multi-mode bosonic encoding and measurement.

					<dc:description>  Compression in giant molecular cloud (GMC) collisions is a promising
mechanism to trigger formation of massive star clusters and OB associations. We
simulate colliding and non-colliding magnetised GMCs and examine the properties
of prestellar cores, selected from projected mass surface density maps,
including after synthetic {\it ALMA} observations. We then examine core
properties, including mass, size, density, velocity, velocity dispersion,
temperature and magnetic field strength. After four Myr, $\sim1,000$ cores have
formed in the GMC collision and the high-mass end of the core mass function
(CMF) can be fit by a power law $dN/d{\rm{log}}M\propto{M}^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha\simeq0.7$, i.e., relatively top-heavy compared to a Salpeter mass
function. Depending on how cores are identified, a break in the power law can
appear around a few $\times10\:M_\odot$. The non-colliding GMCs form fewer
cores with a CMF with $\alpha\simeq0.8$ to 1.2, i.e., closer to the Salpeter
index. We compare the properties of these CMFs to those of several observed
samples of cores. Considering other properties, cores formed from colliding
clouds are typically warmer, have more disturbed internal kinematics and are
more likely to be gravitational unbound, than cores formed from non-colliding
GMCs. The dynamical state of the protocluster of cores formed in the GMC-GMC
collision is intrinsically subvirial, but can appear to be supervirial if the
total mass measurement is affected by observations that miss mass on large
scales or at low densities.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  Mixed-integer optimisation problems can be computationally challenging. Here,
we introduce and analyse two efficient algorithms with a specific sequential
design that are aimed at dealing with sampled problems within this class. At
each iteration step of both algorithms, we first test the feasibility of a
given test solution for each and every constraint associated with the sampled
optimisation at hand, while also identifying those constraints that are
violated. Subsequently, an optimisation problem is constructed with a
constraint set consisting of the current basis -- namely, the smallest set of
constraints that fully specifies the current test solution -- as well as
constraints related to a limited number of the identified violating samples. We
show that both algorithms exhibit finite-time convergence towards the optimal
solution. Algorithm 2 features a neural network classifier that notably
improves the computational performance compared to Algorithm 1. We
quantitatively establish these algorithms' efficacy through three numerical
tests: robust optimal power flow, robust unit commitment, and robust random
mixed-integer linear program.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC based on
unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms. To accommodate the
constraints on the problem size dictated by the limitations of current quantum
hardware we develop a classical convolutional autoencoder. The designed quantum
anomaly detection models, namely an unsupervised kernel machine and two
clustering algorithms, are trained to find new-physics events in the latent
representation of LHC data produced by the autoencoder. The performance of the
quantum algorithms is benchmarked against classical counterparts on different
new-physics scenarios and its dependence on the dimensionality of the latent
space and the size of the training dataset is studied. For kernel-based anomaly
detection, we identify a regime where the quantum model significantly
outperforms its classical counterpart. An instance of the kernel machine is
implemented on a quantum computer to verify its suitability for available
hardware. We demonstrate that the observed consistent performance advantage is
related to the inherent quantum properties of the circuit used.

					<dc:description>  A transpiler converts code from one programming language to another. Many
practical uses of transpilers require the user to be able to guide or customize
the program produced from a given input program. This customizability is
important for satisfying many application-specific goals for the produced code
such as ensuring performance, readability, maintainability, compatibility, and
so on. Conventional transpilers are deterministic rule-driven systems often
written without offering customizability per user and per program. Recent
advances in transpilers based on neural networks offer some customizability to
users, e.g. through interactive prompts, but they are still difficult to
precisely control the production of a desired output. Both conventional and
neural transpilation also suffer from the &quot;last mile&quot; problem: they produce
correct code on average, i.e., on most parts of a given program, but not
necessarily for all parts of it. We propose a new transpilation approach that
offers fine-grained customizability and reusability of transpilation rules
created by others, without burdening the user to understand the global
semantics of the given source program. Our approach is mostly automatic and
incremental, i.e., constructs translation rules needed to transpile the given
program as per the user's guidance piece-by-piece. We implement the transpiler
as a tool called DuoGlot, which translates Python to Javascript programs, and
evaluate it on the popular GeeksForGeeks benchmarks. DuoGlot achieves 90%
translation accuracy and so it outperforms all existing translators, while it
produces readable code. We evaluate DuoGlot on two additional benchmarks,
containing more challenging and longer programs, and similarly observe improved
accuracy.

					<dc:description>  An old theorem of Newman asserts that any tiling of $\mathbb{Z}$ by a finite
set is periodic. Few years ago Bhattacharya proved the periodic tiling
conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Namely, he proved that for a finite subset $F$ of
$\mathbb{Z}^2$, if there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ such that $F \oplus
A = \mathbb{Z}^d$ then there exists a periodic $A' \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ such
that $F \oplus A' = \mathbb{Z}^d$. The recent refutation of the periodic tiling
conjecture in high dimensions due to Greenfeld and Tao motivates finding
different generalizations of Newman's theorem and of Bhattacharya's theorem
that hold in arbitrary dimension $d$. In this paper, we formulate and prove
such generalizations. We do so by studying the structure of joint co-tiles in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our generalization of Newman's theorem states that for any $d
\ge 1$, any joint co-tile for $d$ independent tiles is periodic. For a
$(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy a certain
technical condition that we call property $(\star)$, we prove that any joint
co-tile decomposes into disjoint $(d-1)$-periodic sets. Consequently, we show
that for a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy
property $(\star)$, the existence of a joint co-tile implies the existence of
periodic joint co-tile. Conversely, we prove that if a finite subset $F$ in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ admits a periodic co-tile $A$, then there exist $(d-1)$
additional tiles that together with $F$ are independent and admit $A$ as a
joint co-tile, and $(d-2)$ additional tiles that together with $F$ satisfy the
property $(\star)$. Combined, our results give a new necessary and sufficient
condition for a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to tile periodically. We also discuss
tilings and joint tilings in other countable abelian groups.

larger than one. In the first part of this paper, we define $K$-theoretic
stable pair invariants on the crepant resolution of the affine quotient
$\mathbb{C}^4/G$, and conjecture closed formulae for their generating series,
expressed in terms of the root system of $G$. In the second part, we define
degree zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-orbifolds, develop a
vertex formalism that computes the invariants in the toric case and conjecture
closed formulae for the quotient stacks $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$,
$[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2]$. Combining these two parts, we
formulate a crepant resolution correspondence which relates the above two

					<dc:description>  Dynamical systems and physical models defined on idealized continuous phase
spaces are known to exhibit non-computable phenomena, examples include the wave
equation, recurrent neural networks, or Julia sets in holomorphic dynamics.
Inspired by the works of Moore and Siegelmann, we show that ideal fluids,
modeled by the Euler equations, are capable of simulating poly-time Turing
machines with polynomial advice on compact three-dimensional domains. The
complexity class that is shown to be computable by stationary ideal fluids is
precisely the one considered by Siegelmann in her study of analog recurrent
neural networks: the class $P/poly$. In the last part, we introduce a new class
of symbolic systems, related to countably piecewise linear transformations of
the unit square, that is capable of simulating Turing machines with advice in
real-time, contrary to previously known models.

					<dc:description>  From the perspective of social choice theory, ranked-choice voting (RCV) is
known to have many flaws. RCV can fail to elect a Condorcet winner and is
susceptible to monotonicity paradoxes and the spoiler effect, for example. We
use a database of 182 American ranked-choice elections for political office
from the years 2004-2022 to investigate empirically how frequently RCV's
deficiencies manifest in practice. Our general finding is that RCV's weaknesses
are rarely observed in real-world elections, with the exception that ballot
exhaustion frequently causes majoritarian failures.

					<dc:description>  We constrain the photon mass from well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs)
using Bayes inference method. The probability distributions of dispersion
measures (DM) of host galaxy and intergalactic medium are properly taken into
account. The photon mass is tightly constrained from 17 well-localized FRBs in
the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;0.66$. Assuming that there is no redshift evolution of
host DM, the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ upper limits of photon mass are
constrained to be $m_\gamma&lt;4.8\times 10^{-51}$ kg and $m_\gamma&lt;7.1\times
10^{-51}$ kg, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that, even enlarging
the FRB sample to 200 and extending the redshift range to $0&lt;z&lt;3$ couldn't
significantly improve the constraining ability on photon mass. This is because
of the large uncertainty on the DM of intergalactic medium.

					<dc:description>  We investigate finite right-distributive binary algebraic structures called
shelves. We first use symbolic computations with Python to classify (up to
isomorphism) all connected shelves with order less than six. As an application,
we construct \emph{two} invariants: the coloring invariant and the Sate-Sum
invariant of positive knots. We give explicit examples of positive knots
showing that the State-Sum invariant is a \emph{strict} enhancement of the
coloring invariant. We also define two-variable shelf polynomial by analogy
with the quandle polynomial and then state a conjecture about connected
idempotent shelves. This work paves the way for further potential applications
of shelves.

					<dc:description>  Reidemeister (or twisted conjugacy) classes are considered in restricted
wreath products of the form $G\wr \mathbb{Z}^k$, where $G$ is a finite group.
  For an automorphism $\varphi$ of finite order with finite Reidemeister number
$R(\varphi)$, this number is identified with the number of equivalence classes
of finite-dimensional unitary representations that are fixed by the dual
homeomorphism $\widehat{\varphi}$ (i.e. the so-called conjecture TBFT$_f$ is
proved in this case).
  We construct a counterexample from this class of groups to disprove the
following conjecture: if a finitely generated residually finite group has an
automorphism with $R(\varphi)&lt;\infty$ then it is solvable-by-finite (so-called
conjecture R).

					<dc:description>  Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
such as MoS$_2$, are promising candidates for nanoscale photonics because of
strong-light matter interactions. However, Fermi level pinning due to
metal-induced gap (MIGS) states at the metals-monolayer MoS$_2$ interface
limits the application of optoelectronic devices based on conventional metals
because of the high contact resistance of the Schottky contacts. On the other
hand, a semimetal-TMD-semimetal device can overcome this limitation, where the
MIGS are sufficiently suppressed and can result in ohmic contacts. Here we
demonstrate the optoelectronic performance of a bismuth-monolayer (1L)
MoS$_2$-bismuth device with ohmic electrical contacts and extraordinary
optoelectronic properties. To address the wafer-scale production, we grew full
coverage 1L MoS$_2$ by using chemical vapor deposition method. We measured high
photoresponsivity of 300 A/W in the UV regime at 77 K, which translates into an
external quantum efficiency (EQE) ~ 1000 or $10^5$%. We found that the 90% rise
time of our devices at 77 K is 0.1 ms, which suggests that the current devices
can operate at the speed of ~ 10 kHz. The combination of large-array device
fabrication, high sensitivity, and high-speed response offers great potential
for applications in photonics that includes integrated optoelectronic circuits.

					<dc:description>  We report our analysis results for the globular cluster (GC) NGC~6341 (M92),
as a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1717$+$4308A has recently been reported found in
this GC. The data used are from the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. We detect $\gamma$-ray pulsations of the
MSP at a $4.4\sigma$ confidence level (the corresponding weighted H-test value
is $\sim$28.4). This MSP, the fourth $\gamma$-ray pulsar found in a GC, does
not have significant off-pulse emission and has $\gamma$-ray luminosity and
efficiency $1.3\times10^{34}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ and 1.7\% respectively. In order
to have a clear view on the properties of the known GC $\gamma$-ray MSPs, we
re-analyze the \fermi\ LAT data for the other three ones. These four MSPs share
the properties of either having high $\dot{E}$ ($\sim 10^{36}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$)
or being in the GCs that contain only limited numbers of known MSPs. In
addition, we find that PSRs~J1823$-$3021A and B1821$-$24, in NGC~6624 and
NGC~6626 respectively, have detectable off-pulse $\gamma$-ray emission and PSR
J1835$-$3259B in NGC~6652 does not. Using the obtained off-pulse spectra or
spectral upper limits, we constrain the numbers of other MSPs in the four GCs.
The results are consistent with the numbers of the radio pulsars reported in
them. While at least in NGC~6624 and NGC~6626, the contribution of other MSPs
to their observed $\gamma$-ray emission can not be ignored, our study indicates
that the presence of a bright MSP could be the dominant factor for whether a GC
is detectable at $\gamma$-rays or not.

					<dc:description>  Classification is one of the main applications of supervised learning. Recent
advancement in developing quantum computers has opened a new possibility for
machine learning on such machines. Due to the noisy performance of near-term
quantum computers, error mitigation techniques are essential for extracting
meaningful data from noisy raw experimental measurements. Here, we propose two
ensemble-learning error mitigation methods, namely bootstrap aggregating and
adaptive boosting, which can significantly enhance the performance of
variational quantum classifiers for both classical and quantum datasets. The
idea is to combine several weak classifiers, each implemented on a shallow
noisy quantum circuit, to make a strong one with high accuracy. While both of
our protocols substantially outperform error-mitigated primitive classifiers,
the adaptive boosting shows better performance than the bootstrap aggregating.
The protocols have been exemplified for classical handwriting digits as well as
quantum phase discrimination of a symmetry-protected topological Hamiltonian,
in which we observe a significant improvement in accuracy. Our
ensemble-learning methods provide a systematic way of utilising shallow
circuits to solve complex classification problems.

					<dc:description>  If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that $A \subset B$, generalisation may be
understood as the inference from $A$ of a hypothesis sufficient to construct
$B$. One might infer any number of hypotheses from $A$, yet only some of those
may generalise to $B$. How can one know which are likely to generalise? One
strategy is to choose the shortest, equating the ability to compress
information with the ability to generalise (a proxy for intelligence). We
examine this in the context of a mathematical formalism of enactive cognition.
We show that compression is neither necessary nor sufficient to maximise
performance (measured in terms of the probability of a hypothesis
generalising). We formulate a proxy unrelated to length or simplicity, called
weakness. We show that if tasks are uniformly distributed, then there is no
choice of proxy that performs at least as well as weakness maximisation in all
tasks while performing strictly better in at least one. In other words,
weakness is the pareto optimal choice of proxy. In experiments comparing
maximum weakness and minimum description length in the context of binary
arithmetic, the former generalised at between $1.1$ and $5$ times the rate of
the latter. We argue this demonstrates that weakness is a far better proxy, and
explains why Deepmind's Apperception Engine is able to generalise effectively.

					<dc:description>  We study a gas of bosonic dipolar atoms in the presence of a transverse
harmonic trapping potential by using an improved variational Bethe ansatz,
which includes the transverse width of the atomic cloud as a variational
parameter. Our calculations show that the system behavior evolves from
quasi-one dimensional to a strictly one-dimensional one by changing the
atom-atom interaction, or the axial density, or the frequency of the transverse
confinement. Quite remarkably, in the droplet phase induced by the attractive
dipolar interaction the system becomes sub-one dimensional when the transverse
width is smaller than the characteristic length of the transverse harmonic
confinement.

					<dc:description>  Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)s are relied upon to assess new treatments,
but suffer from limited power to guide personalized treatment decisions. On the
other hand, observational (i.e., non-experimental) studies have large and
diverse populations, but are prone to various biases (e.g. residual
confounding). To safely leverage the strengths of observational studies, we
focus on the problem of falsification, whereby RCTs are used to validate causal
effect estimates learned from observational data. In particular, we show that,
given data from both an RCT and an observational study, assumptions on internal
and external validity have an observable, testable implication in the form of a
set of Conditional Moment Restrictions (CMRs). Further, we show that expressing
these CMRs with respect to the causal effect, or &quot;causal contrast&quot;, as opposed
to individual counterfactual means, provides a more reliable falsification
test. In addition to giving guarantees on the asymptotic properties of our
test, we demonstrate superior power and type I error of our approach on
semi-synthetic and real world datasets. Our approach is interpretable, allowing
a practitioner to visualize which subgroups in the population lead to
falsification of an observational study.

					<dc:description>  The Linux kernel makes considerable use of Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) to
allow user-written BPF applications to execute in the kernel space. BPF employs
a verifier to statically check the security of user-supplied BPF code. Recent
attacks show that BPF programs can evade security checks and gain unauthorized
access to kernel memory, indicating that the verification process is not
flawless. In this paper, we present MOAT, a system that isolates potentially
malicious BPF programs using Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK). Enforcing BPF
program isolation with MPK is not straightforward; MOAT is carefully designed
to alleviate technical obstacles, such as limited hardware keys and supporting
a wide variety of kernel BPF helper functions. We have implemented MOAT in a
prototype kernel module, and our evaluation shows that MOAT delivers low-cost
isolation of BPF programs under various real-world usage scenarios, such as the
isolation of a packet-forwarding BPF program for the memcached database with an
average throughput loss of 6%.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we analyze the residual-based a posteriori error estimation of
the multi-scale cancer invasion model, which is a system of three
non-stationary reaction-diffusion equations. We present the numerical results
of a study on a posteriori error control strategies for FEM approximations of
the model. In this paper, we derive a residual type error estimator for the
cancer invasion model and illustrate its practical performance on a series of
computational tests in three-dimensional spaces. We show that the error
estimator is reliable and efficient regarding the model's small perturbation
parameters.

					<dc:description>  In plasmas composed of massless electrically charged fermions, chirality can
be interchanged with magnetic helicity while preserving the total chirality
through the quantum chiral anomaly. The decay of turbulent energy in plasmas
such as those in the early Universe and compact stars is usually controlled by
certain conservation laws. In the case of zero total chirality, when the
magnetic helicity density balances with the appropriately scaled chiral
chemical potential to zero, the total chirality no longer determines the decay.
We propose that in such a case, an adaptation to the Hosking integral, which is
conserved in nonhelical magnetically dominated turbulence, controls the decay
in turbulence with helicity balanced by chiral fermions. We show, using a high
resolution numerical simulation, that this is indeed the case. The magnetic
energy density decays and the correlation length increases with time just like
in nonhelical turbulence with vanishing chiral chemical potential. But here,
the magnetic helicity density is nearly maximum and shows a novel scaling with
time $t$ proportional to $t^{-2/3}$. This is unrelated to the $t^{-2/3}$ decay
of magnetic energy in fully helical magnetic turbulence. The modulus of the
chiral chemical potential decays in the same fashion. This is much slower than
the exponential decay previously expected in theories of asymmetric baryon
production from the hypermagnetic helicity decay after axion inflation.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to real-world
problems with increasing success. Such applications often require to put
constraints on the agent's behavior. Existing algorithms for constrained RL
(CRL) rely on gradient descent-ascent, but this approach comes with a caveat.
While these algorithms are guaranteed to converge on average, they do not
guarantee last-iterate convergence, i.e., the current policy of the agent may
never converge to the optimal solution. In practice, it is often observed that
the policy alternates between satisfying the constraints and maximizing the
reward, rarely accomplishing both objectives simultaneously. Here, we address
this problem by introducing Reinforcement Learning with Optimistic
Ascent-Descent (ReLOAD), a principled CRL method with guaranteed last-iterate
convergence. We demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on a wide variety of
CRL problems including discrete MDPs and continuous control. In the process we
establish a benchmark of challenging CRL problems.

Ammann-Beenker (AB) tilings. Using this result, and the discrete scale symmetry
of AB tilings, we find exact solutions to a range of other problems including

path problem, and the induced path problem. Of direct relevance to physics, we
solve the equal-weight travelling salesperson problem, providing for example
the most efficient route a scanning tunneling microscope tip could take to
image the atoms of physical quasicrystals, and the 3-colouring problem, giving
ground states for the 3-state Potts model of magnetic interactions. We discuss
the adsorption of chain molecules onto quasicrystal surfaces, with possible

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a new method for end-to-end Video Question Answering
(VideoQA), aside from the current popularity of using large-scale pre-training
with huge feature extractors. We achieve this with a pyramidal multimodal
transformer (PMT) model, which simply incorporates a learnable word embedding
layer, a few convolutional and transformer layers. We use the anisotropic
pyramid to fulfill video-language interactions across different spatio-temporal
scales. In addition to the canonical pyramid, which includes both bottom-up and
top-down pathways with lateral connections, novel strategies are proposed to
decompose the visual feature stream into spatial and temporal sub-streams at
different scales and implement their interactions with the linguistic semantics
while preserving the integrity of local and global semantics. We demonstrate
better or on-par performances with high computational efficiency against
state-of-the-art methods on five VideoQA benchmarks. Our ablation study shows
the scalability of our model that achieves competitive results for
text-to-video retrieval by leveraging feature extractors with reusable
pre-trained weights, and also the effectiveness of the pyramid.

					<dc:description>  Charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) represents a transition between
charged leptons of different generations that violates lepton flavor
conservation, which is a clear signature of possible new physics beyond the
standard model. By exploiting a typical example model of extra Z$^{\prime}$
gauge boson, we perform a detailed comparative study on CLFV searches at
several future lepton colliders, including a 240 GeV electron-positron collider
and a TeV scale muon collider. Based on detailed signal and background
Monte-Carlo studies with fast detector simulations, we derive the potentials in
searching for Z$^{\prime}$ mediated CLFV couplings with $e\mu$, $e\tau$ and
$\mu\tau$ of different future colliders. The results are compared with the
current limits set by either low-energy experiments or the high-energy LHC
experiments. We find that the sensitivity of the $\tau$ related CLFV coupling
strength at future lepton colliders will be significantly improved comparing
with the current best constraints.

					<dc:description>  We study private and robust multi-armed bandits (MABs), where the agent
receives Huber's contaminated heavy-tailed rewards and meanwhile needs to
ensure differential privacy. We first present its minimax lower bound,
characterizing the information-theoretic limit of regret with respect to
privacy budget, contamination level and heavy-tailedness. Then, we propose a
meta-algorithm that builds on a private and robust mean estimation sub-routine
\texttt{PRM} that essentially relies on reward truncation and the Laplace
mechanism only. For two different heavy-tailed settings, we give specific
schemes of \texttt{PRM}, which enable us to achieve nearly-optimal regret. As
by-products of our main results, we also give the first minimax lower bound for
private heavy-tailed MABs (i.e., without contamination). Moreover, our two
proposed truncation-based \texttt{PRM} achieve the optimal trade-off between
estimation accuracy, privacy and robustness. Finally, we support our
theoretical results with experimental studies.

					<dc:description>  Type-II Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$, which superconducts at T_c~0.1 K,
is one of the promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity.
However, the exceedingly low $T_c$ is associated with a small upper critical
field ($H_{c2}$), implying a fragile superconducting phase that only exists on
a small region of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram. Here, we describe a simple and
versatile approach based on the differential thermal expansion between
dissimilar materials to subject a thin single crystalline MoTe$_2$ to biaxial
strain. With this approach, we successfully enhance the $T_c$ of MoTe$_2$
five-fold and consequently expand the superconducting region on the $H$-$T$
phase diagram significantly. To demonstrate the relative ease of studying the
superconductivity in the biaxially strained MoTe$_2$, we further present the
magnetotransport data, enabling the study of the temperature-dependent $H_{c2}$
and the anisotropy of the superconducting state which would otherwise be
difficult to obtain in a free-standing MoTe$_2$. Our work shows that biaxial
strain is an effective knob to tune the electronic properties of MoTe$_2$. Due
to the simplicity of our methodology to apply biaxial strain, we anticipate its
direct applicability to a wider class of quantum materials.

					<dc:description>  Learning from human preferences is important for language models to be
helpful and useful for humans, and to align with human and social values. Prior
work have achieved remarkable successes by learning from human feedback to
understand and follow instructions. Nonetheless, these methods are either
founded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators,
rendering them ineffective in terms of data utilization and challenging to
apply in general, or they depend on reward functions and reinforcement
learning, which are prone to imperfect reward function and extremely
challenging to optimize. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of
Hindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback,
regardless of its polarity. Our idea is inspired by how humans learn from
extensive feedback presented in the form of languages. We convert all types of
feedback into sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model, allowing
us to take advantage of the language comprehension capabilities of language
models. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with
feedback. By doing so, models are trained to generate outputs based on
feedback, and models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or
errors. Applying our method to large language models, we observed that Chain of
Hindsight significantly surpasses previous methods in aligning language models
with human preferences. We observed significant improvements on summarization
and dialogue tasks and our approach is markedly preferred in human evaluations.

					<dc:title>Five methods for determining pattern speeds in galaxies</dc:title>

					<dc:creator>Saha, Kanak</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Wu, Yu-Ting</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Aims. New or refined methods for determining instantaneous scalar and vector
pattern speeds from a restricted domain are developed, for applications in
N-body simulations or in galaxies.
  Methods. The general feature used throughout follows from the fact that the
time-derivative of a function of the coordinates is linearly proportional to
its rotation rate and its particle velocities. Knowing these allow in general
to retrieve the instantaneous pattern speed vector by linear optimization.
Similarly, if an invariant function depends both on the position and
velocities, then its instantaneous rotation vectors in space can be retrieved.
Knowing the accelerations allows to find rotation in velocity space.
  Results. The first 3 methods are based on the assumed rotational invariance
of functions at each point in space or velocity space:
  1) The 6D invariant function method measuring the pattern speed vectors in
space and velocity space,
  2) The differential/regional 3D Tremaine-Weinberg method evaluated over high
signal to noise ratio regions,
  3) The 3D Jacobi integral method yielding the potential pattern speed.
  Extensions to derive the rotation center position, speed and acceleration are
introduced in 1) and 3). The last 2 methods are based on the assumed invariance
of average functions of the particle coordinates.
  4) The moment of inertia methods by using the derivative of the singular
value decomposition,
  5) The 2D Fourier method (3D for m = 2 mode) giving the mode rotation speeds.
Pattern speed accelerations are also derived in 4) and 5).
  Conclusions. Depending on the available data, the different methods provide a
choice of approaches.

					<dc:description>  Knowledge on changes in glacier calving front positions is important for
assessing the status of glaciers. Remote sensing imagery provides the ideal
database for monitoring calving front positions, however, it is not feasible to
perform this task manually for all calving glaciers globally due to
time-constraints. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential for
glacier calving front delineation from optical and radar satellite imagery. The
calving front is represented as a single thin line between the ocean and the
glacier, which makes the task vulnerable to inaccurate predictions. The limited
availability of annotated glacier imagery leads to a lack of data diversity
(not all possible combinations of different weather conditions, terminus
shapes, sensors, etc. are present in the data), which exacerbates the
difficulty of accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose
Attention-Multi-hooking-Deep-supervision HookNet (AMD-HookNet), a novel glacier
calving front segmentation framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
The proposed method aims to enhance the feature representation capability
through multiple information interactions between low-resolution and
high-resolution inputs based on a two-branch U-Net. The attention mechanism,
integrated into the two branch U-Net, aims to interact between the
corresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. This allows the network to
automatically adjust feature relationships, resulting in accurate
pixel-classification predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on the
challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe show that our
AMD-HookNet achieves a mean distance error of 438 m to the ground truth
outperforming the current state of the art by 42%, which validates its
effectiveness.

					<dc:description>  The nuclear stellar disc (NSD) is a flat dense stellar structure at the heart
of the Milky Way. Recent work has shown that analogous structures are common in
the nuclei of external spiral galaxies, where there is evidence of an age
gradient that indicates that they form inside-out. However, the
characterisation of the age of the NSD stellar population along the line of
sight is still missing due to its extreme source crowding and the high
interstellar extinction towards the Galactic centre. We aim to characterise the
age of the stellar population at different average Galactocentric NSD radii to
investigate for the first time the presence of an age gradient along the line
of sight. We selected two groups of stars at different NSD radii via their
different extinction and proper motion distribution. We analysed their stellar
population by fitting their de-reddened $K_s$ luminosity functions with a
linear combination of theoretical models. We find significant differences in
the stellar population at different NSD radii, indicating the presence of an
age gradient along the line of sight. Our sample from the closest edge of the
NSD contains a significant fraction ($\sim40 \%$ of its total stellar mass) of
intermediate-age stars (2-7 Gyr) that is not present in the sample from stars
deeper inside the NSD, in which $\sim90 \%$ of the stellar mass is older than 7
Gyr. Our results suggest that the NSD age distribution is similar to the one
found in external galaxies and they imply that bar-driven processes observed in
external galaxies are similarly at play in the Milky Way.

					<dc:description>  Efficiently querying data on embedded sensor and IoT devices is challenging
given the very limited memory and CPU resources. With the increasing volumes of
collected data, it is critical to process, filter, and manipulate data on the
edge devices where it is collected to improve efficiency and reduce network
transmissions. Existing embedded index structures do not adapt to the data
distribution and characteristics. This paper demonstrates how applying learned
indexes that develop space efficient summaries of the data can dramatically
improve the query performance and predictability. Learned indexes based on
linear approximations can reduce the query I/O by 50 to 90% and improve query
throughput by a factor of 2 to 5, while only requiring a few kilobytes of RAM.
Experimental results on a variety of time series data sets demonstrate the
advantages of learned indexes that considerably improve over the
state-of-the-art index algorithms.

					<dc:creator>Bennett, Michael Timothy</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  To make accurate inferences in an interactive setting, an agent must not
confuse passive observation of events with having intervened to cause those
events. The do operator formalises interventions so that we may reason about
their effect. Yet there exist pareto optimal mathematical formalisms of general
intelligence in an interactive setting which, presupposing no explicit
representation of intervention, make maximally accurate inferences. We examine
one such formalism. We show that in the absence of an operator, an intervention
can still be represented by a variable. Furthermore, the need to explicitly
represent interventions in advance arises only because we presuppose
abstractions. The aforementioned formalism avoids this and so, initial
conditions permitting, representations of relevant causal interventions will
emerge through induction. These emergent abstractions function as
representations of one`s self and of any other object, inasmuch as the
interventions of those objects impact the satisfaction of goals. We argue (with
reference to theory of mind) that this explains how one might reason about
one's own identity and intent, those of others, of one`s own as perceived by
others and so on. In a narrow sense this describes what it is to be aware, and
is a mechanistic explanation of aspects of consciousness.

					<dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel CTA (Combine-Then-Adapt)-based decentralized
algorithm for solving convex composite optimization problems over undirected
and connected networks. The local loss function in these problems contains both
smooth and nonsmooth terms. The proposed algorithm uses uncoordinated
network-independent constant stepsizes and only needs to approximately solve a
sequence of proximal mappings, which is advantageous for solving decentralized
composite optimization problems where the proximal mappings of the nonsmooth
loss functions may not have analytical solutions. For the general convex case,
we prove an O(1/k) convergence rate of the proposed algorithm, which can be
improved to o(1/k) if the proximal mappings are solved exactly. Furthermore,
with metric subregularity, we establish a linear convergence rate for the
proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the
algorithm.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we consider Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) consisting of
low-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite or
zero gradients caused by the non-differentiable discrete function in the
training process. In this case, most training-based DNNs use the standard
Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete
values. However, the STE will cause the problem of gradient mismatch, which
implies that the approximated gradient is with perturbations. We propose an
analysis that this mismatch can be viewed as a metric perturbation in a
Riemannian manifold through the lens of duality theory. To address this
problem, based on the information geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly
Euclidean (LNE) manifold for DNNs as a background to deal with perturbations.
By introducing a partial differential equation on metrics, the Ricci flow, we
prove the dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the
$L^2$-norm perturbation. And unlike the previous perturbation theory which
gives the rate of convergence is the fractional powers, we yield the metric
perturbation under the Ricci flow can be exponentially decayed in the LNE
manifold. The experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves better and more stable performance for DNNs than other
representative training-based methods.

					<dc:description>  Large language models have been demonstrated to be valuable in different
fields. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has been trained using massive amounts of
data and simulates human conversation by comprehending context and generating
appropriate responses. It has garnered significant attention due to its ability
to effectively answer a broad range of human inquiries, with fluent and
comprehensive answers surpassing prior public chatbots in both security and
usefulness. However, a comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT's failures is lacking,
which is the focus of this study. Eleven categories of failures, including
reasoning, factual errors, math, coding, and bias, are presented and discussed.
The risks, limitations, and societal implications of ChatGPT are also
highlighted. The goal of this study is to assist researchers and developers in
enhancing future language models and chatbots.

define $\widehat{\mathfrak{G}}_w$ as the top-degree components of the

another basis consisting of $\widehat{\mathfrak{L}}_\alpha$, the top-degree
components of Lascoux polynomials. Our basis connects the Hilbert series of
$\widehat{V}_n$ and $\widehat{V}$ to rook-theoretic results of Garsia and
Remmel. To understand $\widehat{\mathfrak{L}}_\alpha$, we introduce a
combinatorial construction called a ``snow diagram'' that augments and
decorates any diagram $D$. When $D$ is the key diagram of $\alpha$, its snow
diagram yields the leading monomial of $\widehat{\mathfrak{L}}_\alpha$. When
$D$ is the Rothe diagram of $w$, its snow diagram yields the leading monomial
of $\widehat{\mathfrak{G}}_w$, agreeing with the work of Pechenik, Speyer and
Weigandt.

					<dc:description>  Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are
envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control
traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network.
However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper,
we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both
theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent
behavior ``greenwave&quot; (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green
lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid
road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with
multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the
traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection,
we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding
policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy
gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN
algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive
observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent
behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave&quot; policy emerges. We
also verify the ``greenwave&quot; patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network.
Thirdly, the ``greenwave&quot; patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce
favorable solutions since the ``greenwave&quot; policy shown in experiment results
is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple
cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a
grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.

					<dc:description>  We introduce Noise2Music, where a series of diffusion models is trained to
generate high-quality 30-second music clips from text prompts. Two types of
diffusion models, a generator model, which generates an intermediate
representation conditioned on text, and a cascader model, which generates
high-fidelity audio conditioned on the intermediate representation and possibly
the text, are trained and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity
music. We explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a
spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find that the
generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key elements of the text
prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood, and era, but goes beyond to
ground fine-grained semantics of the prompt. Pretrained large language models
play a key role in this story -- they are used to generate paired text for the
audio of the training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts
ingested by the diffusion models.

					<dc:description>  We present Neural Congealing -- a zero-shot self-supervised framework for
detecting and jointly aligning semantically-common content across a given set
of images. Our approach harnesses the power of pre-trained DINO-ViT features to
learn: (i) a joint semantic atlas -- a 2D grid that captures the mode of
DINO-ViT features in the input set, and (ii) dense mappings from the unified
atlas to each of the input images. We derive a new robust self-supervised
framework that optimizes the atlas representation and mappings per image set,
requiring only a few real-world images as input without any additional input
information (e.g., segmentation masks). Notably, we design our losses and
training paradigm to account only for the shared content under severe
variations in appearance, pose, background clutter or other distracting
objects. We demonstrate results on a plethora of challenging image sets
including sets of mixed domains (e.g., aligning images depicting sculpture and
artwork of cats), sets depicting related yet different object categories (e.g.,
dogs and tigers), or domains for which large-scale training data is scarce
(e.g., coffee mugs). We thoroughly evaluate our method and show that our
test-time optimization approach performs favorably compared to a
state-of-the-art method that requires extensive training on large-scale
datasets.

					<dc:description>  Recently research on perovskite solar cells has caught much attention for new
energy materials. The material stability against external environment factors
is still to be improved before commercialization. Defects such as oxygen or
water are important for the stability of structural and electrical properties
as well as the performance of perovskite solar cells. RbPbX$_3$-type
perovskites have fantastic chemical stability, good power conversion efficiency
and an appropriate band gap for solar cells. Here we have explored the use of
density-functional theory in combination with dispersion forces to study the
effect of oxygen atom and molecule on the structural properties, and hence the
electronic structure of RbPbI$_3$, which has not been explored extensively for
defects. A significant reduction in the optical band gap (from 2 eV to ~ 1 eV)
has been found due to the formation of defect levels dominated by oxygen and
iodine when there are interstitial oxygen defects. This could in turn make a
positive impact to the optical properties for harvesting light if we can
control the oxygen level appropriately. Even an exotic metallic state has been
found for interstitial oxygen molecule, which is due to the strong O-O, O-Pb,
and O-I bonds, indicating the complex scenarios in this material. The density
of states suggested the oxygen defects would trap the electrons, thus affecting
the electron transport as well. The comparison between oxygen atom and
molecules is consistent with the previous report about oxygen molecule
passivation of perovskite solar cells. Our work has, therefore, provided an
important and timely theoretical insight and guidance to materials processing
and fabrication for preventing performance degradation by controlling the level
of oxygen defects in perovskite solar cells.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the resonant state $X(6900)$. The scattering
amplitudes of coupled channels, $J/\psi J/\psi$-$J/\psi \psi(2S)$-$J/\psi
\psi(3770)$, are constructed with the interaction of four vector mesons
described by effective Lagrangians. The amplitudes are calculated up to one
loop, decomposed by partial wave projection, and unitarized by Pad$\acute{e}$
approximation. These amplitudes are fitted to the latest experimental data sets
of di-$J/\psi$ and $J/\psi \psi(2S)$ invariant mass spectra of LHCb, CMS, and
ATLAS. High-quality solutions are obtained. With these partial wave amplitudes,
we extract the pole parameters of the $X(6900)$. Its quantum number is likely
to be $0^{++}$. According to the pole counting rule as well as analysis of the
phase shifts of the partial waves, it supports our previous conclusion that the
$X(6900)$ prefers to be a compact tetra-quark.

					<dc:description>  Aperiodic algebras are infinite dimensional algebras with generators
corresponding to an element of the aperiodic set. These algebras proved to be
an useful tool in studying elementary excitations that can propagate in
multilayered structures and in the construction of some integrable models in
quantum mechanics. Starting from the works of Patera and Twarock we present
three aperiodic algebras based on Fibonacci-chain quasicrystals: a quasicrystal
Lie algebra, an aperiodic Witt algebra and, finally, an aperiodic Jordan
algebra. While a quasicrystal Lie algebra was already constructed from a
modification of the Fibonacci chain, we here present an aperiodic algebra that
matches exactly the original quasicrystal. Moreover, this is the first time to
our knowledge, that an aperiodic Jordan algebra is presented leaving room for
both theoretical and applicative developments.

					<dc:description>  Clathrates are a materials class with an extremely low phonon thermal
conductivity, which is a key ingredient for a high thermoelectric conversion
efficiency. Here, we present a study on the type-I clathrate
La$_{1.2}$Ba$_{6.8}$Au$_{5.8}$Si$_{38.8}\square_{1.4}$ directed at lowering the
phonon thermal conductivity even further by forming mesoscopic wires out of it.
Our hypothesis is that the interaction of the low-energy rattling modes of the
guest atoms (La and Ba) with the acoustic modes, which originate mainly from
the type-I clathrate framework (formed by Au and Si atoms, with some vacancies
$\square$), cuts off their dispersion and thereby tilts the balance of phonons
relevant for thermal transport to long-wavelength ones. Thus, size effects are
expected to set in at relatively long length scales. The structuring was
carried out using a top-down approach, where the wires, ranging from 1260 nm to
630 nm in diameter, were cut from a piece of single crystal using a focused ion
beam technique. Measurements of the thermal conductivity were performed with a
self-heating $3\omega$ technique down to 80 K. Indeed, they reveal a reduction
of the room-temperature phonon thermal conductivity by a sizable fraction of
$\sim$40 % for our thinnest wire, thereby confirming our hypothesis.

					<dc:description>  Let $\mathsf{Grid}_{n,\infty}$ be the graph with vertex set $\mathbb{Z}^n$ in
which two vertices $u$, $v \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ are adjacent if and only if
$\|u-v\|_\infty=1$. Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich conjectured that
every connected graph $G$ of polynomial growth admits an injective homomorphism
to $\mathsf{Grid}_{n,\infty}$ for some $n&lt;\infty$. Moreover, they conjectured
that if every ball of radius $r$ in $G$ contains at most $(r+1)^\rho$ vertices,
then one can take $n = O(\rho)$. Krauthgamer and Lee proved the first part of
this conjecture and refuted the second. In this paper we extend their result in
a number of ways:
  (1) We construct asymptotically injective contractions from graphs $G$ of
polynomial growth to the grid graph $\mathsf{Grid}_{n,\infty}$ with $n =
O(\rho)$, where $\rho$ is the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of $G$. This
confirms the second part of the Levin/Linial--London--Rabinovich conjecture &quot;in
the asymptotic sense.&quot;
  (2) We construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to grid
graphs, answering a question of Papasoglu.
  (3) We extend the Krauthgamer--Lee theorem and all our results to the realm
of Borel graphs and prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ are, in an appropriate sense, universal for the class of Borel
graphs of polynomial growth.
  Along the way we find an alternative proof of the result of Papasoglu that
graphs of polynomial growth rate $\rho&lt;\infty$ have asymptotic dimension at
most $\rho$. Furthermore, our proof works in the Borel setting and shows that
Borel graphs of polynomial growth rate $\rho&lt;\infty$ have Borel asymptotic
dimension at most $\rho$, and hence they are hyperfinite. This generalizes a
result of Jackson, Kechris, and Louveau from Schreier graphs of Borel group
actions to arbitrary Borel graphs of polynomial growth and answers a question
of Marks.

					<dc:description>  Background and Objective: This study considers dynamic modelling of the
cerebral arterial circulation and reconstructing an atlas for the electrical
conductivity of the brain. The conductivity is a governing parameter in several
electrophysiological modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and
transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). While high-resolution 7 Tesla
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data allows for reconstructing the cerebral
arteries with a cross-sectional diameter larger than the voxel size, the
conductivity cannot be directly inferred from MRI data. The state-of-the-art
head models applied in EEG and tES typically associate each head tissue
compartment with a constant conductivity, omitting any dynamical effects of
cerebral circulation. Incorporating those effects poses the challenge of
solving a system of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) in a
realistic multi-compartment head model.
  Methods: We propose that circulation in the distinguishable arteries can be
estimated via the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). To establish a fluid
exchange model between arteries and microarteries, a boundary condition derived
from the Hagen-Poisseuille model is applied. The relationship between the
estimated blood concentration and the tissue conductivity is approximated
through Archie's law for fluid flow in porous media.
  Results: Through the formulation of the PPE and a set of boundary conditions
based on the Hagen-Poisseuille model, we obtained an equivalent formulation of
the incompressible NSEs. Thus, allowing effective blood pressure estimation in
cerebral arteries segmented from open 7 Tesla MRI data.
  Conclusions: We developed and built a useful modeling framework that accounts
for the effects of dynamic blood flow on a novel MRI-based conductivity atlas.

					<dc:description>  The orbital evolution of a binary system consisting of two primordial black
hole clusters is investigated. Such clusters are predicted in some theoretical
models with broken symmetry in the inflation Lagrangian. A cluster consists of
the most massive central black hole surrounded by many smaller black holes.
Similar to single primordial black holes, clusters can form gravitationally
bounded pairs and merge during their orbital evolution. The replacement of
single black holes by such clusters significantly changes the entire merger
process and the final rate of gravitational wave bursts in some parameter
ranges (with sufficiently large cluster radii). A new important factor is the
tidal gravitational interaction of the clusters. It leads to an additional
dissipation of the orbital energy, which is transferred into the internal
energy of the clusters or carried away by black holes flying out of the
clusters. Comparison with the data of gravitational-wave telescopes allows one
to constrain the fractions of primordial black holes in clusters, depending on
their mass and compactness. Even the primordial black hole fraction in the
composition of dark matter $\simeq1$ turns out to be compatible with LIGO/Virgo
observational data, if the black holes are in clusters.

					<dc:description>  Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is widely employed for modeling
combinatorial optimization problems. In practice, similar MILP instances with
only coefficient variations are routinely solved, and machine learning (ML)
algorithms are capable of capturing common patterns across these MILP
instances. In this work, we combine ML with optimization and propose a novel
predict-and-search framework for efficiently identifying high-quality feasible
solutions. Specifically, we first utilize graph neural networks to predict the
marginal probability of each variable, and then search for the best feasible
solution within a properly defined ball around the predicted solution. We
conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, and computational results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves 51.1% and 9.9% performance
improvements to MILP solvers SCIP and Gurobi on primal gaps, respectively.

					<dc:description>  We report the existence of novel static spherical black-hole solutions in a
vector-tensor gravitational theory called the bumblebee gravity model which
extends the Einstein-Maxwell theory by allowing the vector to nonminimally
couple to the Ricci curvature tensor. A test of the solutions in the
strong-field regime is performed for the first time using the recent
observations of the supermassive black-hole shadows in the galaxy M87 and the
Milky Way from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. The parameter space
is found largely unexcluded and more experiments are needed to fully bound the
theory.

					<dc:description>  Large pretrained language models (LMs) have shown impressive In-Context
Learning (ICL) ability, where the model learns to do an unseen task via a
prompt consisting of input-output examples as the demonstration, without any
parameter updates. The performance of ICL is highly dominated by the quality of
the selected in-context examples. However, previous selection methods are
mostly based on simple heuristics, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this
work, we formulate in-context example selection as a subset selection problem.
We propose CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning), which is
instantiated by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the interaction
between the given input and in-context examples, and optimized through a
carefully-designed contrastive learning objective to obtain preference from
LMs. We validate CEIL on 12 classification and generation datasets from 7
distinct NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, natural
language inference, commonsense reasoning, open-domain question answering, code
generation, and semantic parsing. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only
the state-of-the-art performance but also the transferability and
compositionality of CEIL, shedding new light on effective and efficient
in-context learning. Our code is released at
https://github.com/HKUNLP/icl-ceil.

					<dc:description>  There are significant regional inequities in health resources around the
world. It has become one of the most focused topics to improve health services
for data-scarce hospitals and promote health equity through knowledge sharing
among medical institutions. Because electronic medical records (EMRs) contain
sensitive personal information, privacy protection is unavoidable and essential
for multi-hospital collaboration. In this paper, for a common disease in ICU
patients, sepsis, we propose a novel cross-center collaborative learning
framework guided by medical knowledge, SofaNet, to achieve early recognition of
this disease. The Sepsis-3 guideline, published in 2016, defines that sepsis
can be diagnosed by satisfying both suspicion of infection and Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) greater than or equal to 2. Based on this knowledge,
SofaNet adopts a multi-channel GRU structure to predict SOFA values of
different systems, which can be seen as an auxiliary task to generate better
health status representations for sepsis recognition. Moreover, we only achieve
feature distribution alignment in the hidden space during cross-center
collaborative learning, which ensures secure and compliant knowledge transfer
without raw data exchange. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets,
MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SofaNet can benefit early sepsis
recognition when hospitals only have limited EMRs.

					<dc:description>  Point Cloud Registration is a fundamental and challenging problem in 3D
computer vision. Recent works often utilize the geometric structure information
in point feature embedding or outlier rejection for registration while
neglecting to consider explicitly isometry-preserving constraint ($e.g.,$ point
pair linked edge's length preserving after transformation) in training. We
claim that the explicit isometry-preserving constraint is also important for
improving feature representation abilities in the feature training stage. To
this end, we propose a \underline{G}raph \underline{M}atching
\underline{O}ptimization based \underline{Net}work (GMONet for short), which
utilizes the graph-matching optimizer to explicitly exert the isometry
preserving constraints in the point feature training to improve the point
feature representation. Specifically, we exploit a partial graph-matching
optimizer to optimize the super point ($i.e.,$ down-sampled key points)
features and a full graph-matching optimizer to optimize fine-level point
features in the overlap region. Meanwhile, we leverage the inexact proximal
point method and the mini-batch sampling technique to accelerate these two
graph-matching optimizers. Given high discriminative point features in the
evaluation stage, we utilize the RANSAC approach to estimate the transformation
between the scanned pairs. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
3DMatch/3DLoMatch benchmarks and the KITTI benchmark. The experimental results
show that our method performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

					<dc:description>  Silent speech interface is a promising technology that enables private
communications in natural language. However, previous approaches only support a
small and inflexible vocabulary, which leads to limited expressiveness. We
leverage contrastive learning to learn efficient lipreading representations,
enabling few-shot command customization with minimal user effort. Our model
exhibits high robustness to different lighting, posture, and gesture conditions
on an in-the-wild dataset. For 25-command classification, an F1-score of 0.8947
is achievable only using one shot, and its performance can be further boosted
by adaptively learning from more data. This generalizability allowed us to
develop a mobile silent speech interface empowered with on-device fine-tuning
and visual keyword spotting. A user study demonstrated that with LipLearner,
users could define their own commands with high reliability guaranteed by an
online incremental learning scheme. Subjective feedback indicated that our
system provides essential functionalities for customizable silent speech
interactions with high usability and learnability.

					<dc:title>A Quasi-Newton Subspace Trust Region Algorithm for Least-square Problems

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The first-order optimality conditions of convexly constrained
nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems formulate variational
inequality problems, which are equivalent to a system of nonsmooth equations.
In this paper, we propose a quasi-Newton subspace trust region (QNSTR)
algorithm for the least-square problem defined by the smoothing approximation
of the nonsmooth equation. Based on the structure of the least-square problem,
we use an adaptive quasi-Newton formula to approximate the Hessian matrix and
solve a low-dimensional strongly convex quadratic program with ellipse
constraints in a subspace at each step of QNSTR algorithm. According to the
structure of the adaptive quasi-Newton formula and the subspace technique, the
strongly convex quadratic program at each step can be solved efficiently. We
prove the global convergence of QNSTR algorithm to an $\epsilon$-first-order
stationary point of the min-max optimization problem. Moreover, we present
numerical results of QNSTR algorithm with different subspaces for the mixed
generative adversarial networks in eye image segmentation using real data to
show the efficiency and effectiveness of QNSTR algorithm for solving large
scale min-max optimization problems.

					<dc:description>  Allowing a high quality factor (Q-factor) to a sub-wavelength dielectric
resonator, quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BIC) has gained much
interest. However, the Q-BIC resonance condition is too sensitive to the
geometry of the resonator and its practical broadband generation on a
single-wafer platform has been limited. Here, we present that employing the
base angle as a structural degree of freedom, the truncated nano-cone resonator
supports the Q-BIC resonance with a high Q-factor of &gt;150 over a wide
wavelength range of &gt;100 nm. We expect our approach will boost the utilization
of the Q-BIC resonance for various applications requiring broadband spectral
tuning.

class of quantum codes. In this paper, by using Hermitian self-orthogonal
generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS for short) codes, we construct four new classes
of $q$-ary quantum MDS codes. The $q$-ary quantum MDS codes we construct have
larger minimum distances. And the minimum distance of these codes is greater
than $q/2+1$. Furthermore, it turns out that our quantum MDS codes generalize

					<dc:description>  A ray-theoretic phase space description of linear waves in a two-fluid
(charges and neutrals) magnetized plasma is used to calculate analytic decay
rates and mode transmission and conversion coefficients between fast and slow
waves in two dimensions due to finite ion-neutral collision frequencies at
arbitrary ionization fraction. This is relevant to partially ionized
astrophysical plasmas, in particular solar and stellar atmospheres. The most
important parameter governing collisional effects is the ratio of the wave
frequency to the neutral-charges collision frequency,
$\epsilon=\omega/\nu_{nc}$, with secondary dependence on ionization fraction
and wave attack angle. Comparison is made to the one-fluid magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) case, and it is found that acoustic-to-acoustic and magnetic-to-magnetic
transmission through the Alfv\'en-acoustic equipartition layer is decreased by
a term of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ relative to one-fluid (infinite collision
frequency), and correspondingly acoustic-to-magnetic and magnetic-to-acoustic
conversion is increased. The neutral acoustic mode is shown to dissipate
rapidly as $\nu_{nc}\to\infty$. Away from the mode conversion region,
dissipative decay along the remaining magneto-acoustic rays scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ and is found to be much more effective on magnetically
dominated rays compared to acoustically dominated rays. This produces a steep
jump in dissipation in mode conversion regions, where the rays change
character, and can produce localized heating there and beyond. Applications to
the solar chromosphere are discussed.

existing UX paradigm mainly aims at non-intelligent systems and lacks a
systematic approach to UX for intelligent systems. Throughout the development
of UX, the UX paradigm shows the evolution characteristics of the
cross-technology era. At present, the intelligence era has put forward new
demands on the UX paradigm. For this reason, this paper proposes a &quot;UX 3.0&quot;
paradigm framework and the corresponding UX methodology system in the
intelligence era. The &quot;UX 3.0&quot; paradigm framework includes five categories of
UX methods: ecological experience, innovation-enabled experience, AI-enabled
experience, human-AI interaction-based experience, and human-AI
collaboration-based experience methods, each of which includes corresponding
multiple UX paradigmatic orientations. The proposal of the &quot;UX 3.0&quot; paradigm
helps improve the existing UX methods and provides methodological support for
the research and application of UX in developing intelligent systems. Finally,
this paper looks forward to future research and application of the &quot;UX 3.0&quot;
paradigm.

					<dc:description>  Accurate localization of the fovea is a crucial initial step in analyzing
retinal diseases since it helps prevent irreversible vision loss. Although
current deep learning-based methods achieve better performance than traditional
methods, they still face challenges such as inadequate utilization of
anatomical landmarks, sensitivity to diseased retinal images, and various image
conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture
(Bilateral-Fuser) for multi-cue fusion. The Bilateral-Fuser explicitly
incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel
distributions to achieve robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial
attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder to extract and fuse self-learned
anatomical information. This design focuses more on features distributed along
blood vessels and significantly reduces computational costs by reducing token
numbers. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and
one large-scale private dataset. Moreover, we show that the Bilateral-Fuser is
more robust on both normal and diseased retina images and has better
generalization capacity in cross-dataset experiments.

					<dc:description>  LP-duality theory has played a central role in the study of the core, right
from its early days to the present time. However, despite the extensive nature
of this work, basic gaps still remain. We address these gaps using the
following building blocks from LP-duality theory: \begin{enumerate}
  \item Total unimodularity (TUM).
  \item Complementary slackness conditions and strict complementarity.
\end{enumerate}
  Our exploration of TUM leads to defining new games, characterizing their
cores and giving novel ways of using core imputations to enforce constraints
that arise naturally in applications of these games. The latter include:
\begin{enumerate} \item Efficient algorithms for finding {\em min-max fair and
max-min fair core imputations}.
  \item {\em Encouraging diversity and avoiding over-representation} in a
generalization of the assignment game. \end{enumerate}
  Complementarity enables us to prove new properties of core imputations of the
assignment game and its generalizations.

					<dc:description>  Aggregating pharmaceutical data in the drug-target interaction (DTI) domain
has the potential to deliver life-saving breakthroughs. It is, however,
notoriously difficult due to regulatory constraints and commercial interests.
This work proposes the application of federated learning, which we argue to be
reconcilable with the industry's constraints, as it does not require sharing of
any information that would reveal the entities' data or any other high-level
summary of it. When used on a representative GraphDTA model and the KIBA
dataset it achieves up to 15% improved performance relative to the best
available non-privacy preserving alternative. Our extensive battery of
experiments shows that, unlike in other domains, the non-IID data distribution
in the DTI datasets does not deteriorate FL performance. Additionally, we
identify a material trade-off between the benefits of adding new data, and the
cost of adding more clients.

					<dc:description>  In goal-conditioned offline reinforcement learning, an agent learns from
previously collected data to go to an arbitrary goal. Since the offline data
only contains a finite number of trajectories, a main challenge is how to
generate more data. Goal-swapping generates additional data by switching
trajectory goals but while doing so produces a large number of invalid
trajectories. To address this issue, we propose prioritized goal-swapping
experience replay (PGSER). PGSER uses a pre-trained Q function to assign higher
priority weights to goal swapped transitions that allow reaching the goal. In
experiments, PGSER significantly improves over baselines in a wide range of
benchmark tasks, including challenging previously unsuccessful dexterous
in-hand manipulation tasks.

					<dc:title>Quantifying polarization across political groups on key policy issues

					<dc:description>  There is growing concern that over the past decade, industrialized democratic
nations are becoming increasingly politically polarized. Indeed, elections in
the US, UK, France, and Germany have all seen tightly won races, with notable
examples including the 2016 Trump vs. Clinton presidential election and the
UK's Brexit referendum. However, while there has been much qualitative
discussion of polarization on key issues, there are few examples of formal
quantitative assessments examining this topic. Therefore, in this paper, we
undertake a statistical evaluation of political polarization for
representatives elected to the US congress on key policy issues between
2021-2022. The method is based on applying sentiment analysis to Twitter data
and developing quantitative analysis for six political groupings defined based
on voting records. Two sets of policy groups are explored, including
geopolitical policies (e.g., Ukraine-Russia, China, Taiwan, etc.) and domestic
policies (e.g., abortion, climate change, LGBTQ, immigration, etc.). We find
that out of the twelve policies explored here, gun control was the most
politically polarizing, with significant polarization results found for all
groups (four of which were P &lt; 0.001). The next most polarizing issues include
immigration and border control, fossil fuels, and Ukraine-Russia.
Interestingly, the least polarized policy topics were Taiwan, LGBTQ, and the
Chinese Communist Party, potentially demonstrating the highest degree of
bipartisanship on these issues. The results can be used to guide future policy
making, by helping to identify areas of common ground across political groups.

					<dc:description>  Image data set from a multi-spectral animal imaging system is used to address
two issues: (a) registering the oscillation in optical coherence tomography
(OCT) images due to mouse eye movement and (b) suppressing the shadow region
under the thick vessels/structures. Several classical and AI-based algorithms
in combination are tested for each task to see their compatibility with data
from the combined animal imaging system. Hybridization of AI with optical flow
followed by Homography transformation is shown to be working (correlation
value&gt;0.7) for registration. Resnet50 backbone is shown to be working better
than the famous U-net model for shadow region detection with a loss value of
0.9. A simple-to-implement analytical equation is shown to be working for
brightness manipulation with a 1% increment in mean pixel values and a 77%
decrease in the number of zeros. The proposed equation allows formulating a
constraint optimization problem using a controlling factor {\alpha} for
minimization of number of zeros, standard deviation of pixel value and
maximizing the mean pixel value. For Layer segmentation, the standard U-net
model is used. The AI-Pipeline consists of CNN, Optical flow, RCNN, pixel
manipulation model, and U-net models in sequence. The thickness estimation
process has a 6% error as compared to manual annotated standard data.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel approach (called GPT4MIA) that utilizes
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a plug-and-play transductive
inference tool for medical image analysis (MIA). We provide theoretical
analysis on why a large pre-trained language model such as GPT-3 can be used as
a plug-and-play transductive inference model for MIA. At the methodological
level, we develop several technical treatments to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of GPT4MIA, including better prompt structure design, sample
selection, and prompt ordering of representative samples/features. We present
two concrete use cases (with workflow) of GPT4MIA: (1) detecting prediction
errors and (2) improving prediction accuracy, working in conjecture with
well-established vision-based models for image classification (e.g., ResNet).
Experiments validate that our proposed method is effective for these two tasks.
We further discuss the opportunities and challenges in utilizing
Transformer-based large language models for broader MIA applications.

					<dc:description>  This paper develops a second-order explicit predictor-corrector numerical
approach for solving a mathematical model on the dynamic of cytokine
expressions and human immune cell activation in response to the bacterium
staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The proposed algorithm is at least
zero-stable and second-order accurate. Mathematical modeling works that analyze
the human body in response to some antigens have predicted concentrations of a
broad range of cells and cytokines. This study deals with a coupled
cellular-cytokine model which predicts cytokine expressions in response to
gram-positive bacteria S. aureus. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6,
interleukin 8 and interleukin 10 are included to assess the relationship
between cytokine release from macrophages and the concentration of the S.
aureus antigen. Ordinary differential equations are used to model cytokine
levels while the cellular responses are modeled by partial differential
equations. Interactions between both components provide a more robust and
complete systems of immune activation. In the numerical simulations, a low
concentration of S. aureus is used to measure cellular activation and cytokine
expressions. Numerical experiments indicate how the human immune system
responds to infections from different pathogens. Furthermore, numerical
examples suggest that the new technique is faster and more efficient than a
large class of statistical and numerical schemes discussed in the literature
for systems of nonlinear equations and can serve as a robust tool for the
integration of general systems of initial-boundary value problems.

					<dc:description>  Probing electroweak baryogenesis while the Large Hadron Collider is running
is of utmost importance, with electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) providing
the sanity check on $CP$ violation. Remarkably, the general two Higgs doublet
model that possesses a second set of Yukawa couplings, can deliver electroweak
baryogenesis while surviving eEDM, with both rooted in the flavor structure
revealed by Standard Model (SM) physics. We point out a chiral-enhanced
top-bottom interference effect that makes $b \to s\gamma$ decay an exquisite
window on baryogenesis and eEDM.

					<dc:description>  Based on Akama-Diakonov (AK) theory of emergent tetrads, it was
suggested\cite{Volovik2023b} that one can introduce two Planck constants, which
are the parameters of the corresponding components of Minkowski metric. In the
AK theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless, as a result the metric elements
and thus the Planck constants have nonzero dimensions. The Planck constant
$\hbar$ has dimension of time, and the second Planck constant $\hslash$ has
dimension of length. It is natural to compare $\hslash$ with the Planck length
$l_{\rm P}$, which is related to the Newton constant as $l_{\rm P}^2= \hslash
G$. However, this connection remains an open question, because the microscopic
(trans-Planckian) physics of the quantum vacuum is not known. Here we study
this question using the effective gravity emerging for sound wave quanta
(phonons) in superfluid Bose liquid, such as $^4$He, where the microscopic
physics is known: it is atomic physics. The elements of the effective acoustic
metric are determined by the parameters of this Bose liquid, and as in the AK
theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless. One may introduce the effective
&quot;acoustic Planck constants&quot; as elements of acoustic metric, $g^{\mu\nu}_{\rm
ac}= {\rm diag}(-\hbar_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm
ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2)$. Then one obtains that the acoustic Planck constant
$\hslash_{\rm ac}$ has dimension of length, and in liquid helium it is on the
order of the interatomic distance in this liquid, $\hslash_{\rm ac} \sim a$.
This supports the scenario in which the Planck constant in the relativistic
quantum vacuum is on the order of the Planck length, $\hslash\sim l_{\rm P}
\sim G$. We also use the acoustic metric for consideration of the possible
dependence of the Planck constant on the Hubble parameter in expanding
Universe.

					<dc:description>  Patterns of ferroic domains and domain walls are being intensively studied to
implement new logic schemes. Any technological application of such objects
depends on a detailed understanding of them. This study analyzes patterns of
ferromagnetic stripes on equiatomic FePt thin films at low temperatures. Since
FePt is known to develop a transition from in-plane homogeneous magnetization
to stripes upon varying its thickness, multiple samples are studied to consider
the critical value within the analyzed range. Stripes' width demonstrates the
well-known Murayama's law while a non-trivial dependence on temperature is also
reported. Moreover, the room-temperature uniform distribution of the pattern
evolves into a distorted one upon temperature cycling. Finally, dissimilar
striped patterns are obtained upon reducing and increasing temperature
indicating the states are dependent on the history of applied stimuli rather
than the parametric conditions.

					<dc:description>  Building animatable and editable models of clothed humans from raw 3D scans
and poses is a challenging problem. Existing reposing methods suffer from the
limited expressiveness of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), require costly mesh
extraction to generate each new pose, and typically do not preserve surface
correspondences across different poses. In this work, we introduce Invertible
Neural Skinning (INS) to address these shortcomings. To maintain
correspondences, we propose a Pose-conditioned Invertible Network (PIN)
architecture, which extends the LBS process by learning additional pose-varying
deformations. Next, we combine PIN with a differentiable LBS module to build an
expressive and end-to-end Invertible Neural Skinning (INS) pipeline. We
demonstrate the strong performance of our method by outperforming the
state-of-the-art reposing techniques on clothed humans and preserving surface
correspondences, while being an order of magnitude faster. We also perform an
ablation study, which shows the usefulness of our pose-conditioning
formulation, and our qualitative results display that INS can rectify artefacts
introduced by LBS well. See our webpage for more details:

					<dc:description>  The Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is an intelligence tests for measuring
fluid intelligence in artificial intelligence systems and humans alike. In this
paper we present a system for reasoning about and solving ARC tasks. Our system
relies on a program synthesis approach that searches a space of potential
programs for ones that can solve tasks from the ARC. Programs are in a domain
specific language, and in some instances our search algorithm is guided by
insights from a corpus of ground truth programs. In particular: We describe an
imperative style domain specific language, called Visual Imagery Reasoning
Language (VIMRL), for reasoning about tasks in the ARC. We also demonstrate an
innovative approach for how large search spaces can be decomposed using special
high level functions that determine their own arguments through local searches
on a given task item. Finally, we share our results obtained on the publicly
available ARC items as well as our system's strong performance on a private
test, recently tying for 4th place on the global ARCathon 2022 challenge.

					<dc:description>  Suppression of superconductivity in favour of a striped phase, and its
coincidence with a structural transition from a low-temperature orthorhombic
(LTO) to a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase, is a ubiquitous feature of
hole-doped lanthanum cuprates. We study the effect of anisotropic strain on
this transition using density-functional theory on both La$_2$CuO$_4$ and the
recently-synthesised surrogate La$_2$MgO$_4$ to decouple electronic and
structural effects. Strikingly, we find that compressive strain applied
diagonally to the in-plane metal-oxygen bonds dramatically stabilises the LTO
phase. Given the mutual exclusivity of 3D superconductivity and long-range
static stripe order, we thereby suggest a structural mechanism for
understanding experimentally-observed trends in the superconducting
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ under uniaxial pressure, and suggest principles for tuning it.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new method to detect low-energy neutrinos and low-mass dark
matter at or below the MeV scale, through their coherent scatterings from
freely falling heavy atoms and the resulting kinematic shifts. We start with a
simple calculation for illustration: for $10^7$ heavy atoms of a mass number
around 100 with a small recoil energy of 1 meV, the corresponding velocities
can reach $0.01, {\rm m/s}$ and produce significant kinematic shifts that can
be detected. We then show that the proposed device should be able to probe vast
low-energy regions of neutrinos from meV to MeV and can surpass previous limits
on sub-MeV dark matter by several orders of magnitude. Such a proposal can be
useful to (1) detect sub-MeV-scale dark matter: with $10^2$ atom guns shooting
downwards, for example, CsI or lead clusters consisting of $10^{7}$ atoms with
a frequency around $10^3$ Hz, it can already be sensitive to scattering
cross-sections at the level of $10^{-33 (-34)}\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 (0.1) MeV dark
matter and surpass current limits. Technological challenges include
high-quality atom cluster production and injections. (2) Measure coherent
neutrino-nuclei scatterings at the 0.1-1 MeV region for the first time: with
$10^4$ atom guns shooting downwards CsI clusters consisting of $10^{11}$ atoms
and a frequency of $10^{6}$ Hz. One can expect 10 events from MeV solar
neutrinos to be observed per year. Furthermore, (3) this method can be extended
to probe very low-energy neutrinos down to the eV-KeV region and may be able to
detect the cosmic neutrino background, although it remains challenging.

					<dc:description>  Density-based clustering methodology has been widely considered in the
statistical literature for classifying Euclidean observations. However, this
approach has not been contemplated for directional data yet. In this work,
directional density-based clustering methodology is fully established for the
unit hypersphere by solving the computational problems associated to high
dimensional spaces. We also provide a circular and spherical exploratory tool
for studying the effect of the smoothing parameter when kernel density
estimation methods are considered. An extensive simulation study shows the
performance of the resulting classification procedure for the circle and for
the sphere. The methodology is also applied to analyse an exoplanets dataset.

					<dc:description>  We study the correlation structure of firm growth rates. We show that most
firms are correlated because of their exposure to a common factor but that
firms linked through the supply chain exhibit a stronger correlation on average
than firms that are not. Removing this common factor significantly reduces the
average correlation between two firms with no relationship in the supply chain
while maintaining a significant correlation between two firms that are linked.
We then demonstrate how this observation can be used to reconstruct the
topology of a supply chain network using Gaussian Markov Models.

					<dc:description>  Although automatic speech recognition (ASR) can perform well in common
non-overlapping environments, sustaining performance in multi-talker
overlapping speech recognition remains challenging. Recent research revealed
that ASR model's encoder captures different levels of information with
different layers -- the lower layers tend to have more acoustic information,
and the upper layers more linguistic. This inspires us to develop a Sidecar
separator to empower a well-trained ASR model for multi-talker scenarios by
separating the mixed speech embedding between two suitable layers. We
experimented with a wav2vec 2.0-based ASR model with a Sidecar mounted. By
freezing the parameters of the original model and training only the Sidecar
(8.7 M, 8.4% of all parameters), the proposed approach outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin for the 2-speaker mixed LibriMix dataset,
reaching a word error rate (WER) of 10.36%; and obtains comparable results
(7.56%) for LibriSpeechMix dataset when limited training.

derivative-free trust-region methods. This set is optimal in the sense that it
minimizes the constant of well-poisedness in a ball centred at the starting
point. It is chosen as the default initial interpolation set by many
derivative-free trust-region methods based on underdetermined quadratic
interpolation, including NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA, and COBYQA. Our analysis
provides a theoretical justification for this choice.

					<dc:description>  Metrization of statistical divergences is useful in both theoretical and
practical aspects. Considering the fractional powers of statistical divergences
is one way to obtain metrics associated with divergences. With this motivation,
Os\'an, Bussandri, and Lamberti (2018) considered metrizations for the
fractional powers of the Jensen-Shannon divergences between multinomial
distributions and gave an open problem. In this short note, we give an
affirmative answer to their conjecture. This method is also applicable to
powers of f-divergences between the Cauchy distribution.

					<dc:description>  Writing tests is a time-consuming yet essential task during software
development. We propose to leverage recent advances in deep learning for text
and code generation to assist developers in writing tests. We formalize the
novel task of test completion to automatically complete the next statement in a
test method based on the context of prior statements and the code under test.
We develop TeCo -- a deep learning model using code semantics for test
completion. The key insight underlying TeCo is that predicting the next
statement in a test method requires reasoning about code execution, which is
hard to do with only syntax-level data that existing code completion models
use. TeCo extracts and uses six kinds of code semantics data, including the
execution result of prior statements and the execution context of the test
method. To provide a testbed for this new task, as well as to evaluate TeCo, we
collect a corpus of 130,934 test methods from 1,270 open-source Java projects.
Our results show that TeCo achieves an exact-match accuracy of 18, which is 29%
higher than the best baseline using syntax-level data only. When measuring
functional correctness of generated next statement, TeCo can generate runnable
code in 29% of the cases compared to 18% obtained by the best baseline.
Moreover, TeCo is significantly better than prior work on test oracle
generation.

					<dc:title>The Theory of Functional Connections on Vector Spaces</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Leake, Carl</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Analysis of PDEs</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is most often used for constraints
over the field of real numbers. However, previous works have shown that it
actually extends to arbitrary fields. The evidence for these claims is
restricting oneself to the field of real numbers is unnecessary because all of
the theorems, proofs, etc. for TFC apply as written to fields in general. Here,
that notion is taken a step further, as fields themselves are unnecessarily
restrictive. The theorems, proofs, etc. of TFC apply to vector spaces, not just
fields. Moreover, the inputs of the functions/constraints do not even need to
be restricted to vector spaces; they can quite literally be anything. In this
note, the author shows the more general inputs/outputs of the various symbols
that comprise TFC. Examples with accompanying, open-access Python code are
included to aid the reader's understanding.

					<dc:description>  This paper summarises the findings from the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition
Challenge 2022 (VoxSRC-22), which was held in conjunction with INTERSPEECH
2022. The goal of this challenge was to evaluate how well state-of-the-art
speaker recognition systems can diarise and recognise speakers from speech
obtained &quot;in the wild&quot;. The challenge consisted of: (i) the provision of
publicly available speaker recognition and diarisation data from YouTube videos
together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and
(ii) a public challenge and hybrid workshop held at INTERSPEECH 2022. We
describe the four tracks of our challenge along with the baselines, methods,
and results. We conclude with a discussion on the new domain-transfer focus of
VoxSRC-22, and on the progression of the challenge from the previous three
editions.

					<dc:title>Supersymmetric localization: ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ theories on S$^2$ and

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Application of the supersymmetric localization method to theories on anti-de
Sitter spacetime has received recent interest, yet still remains as a
challenging problem. In this paper, we focus on (global) Euclidean AdS$_2$, on
which we consider an Abelian ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ theory and implement localization
computation to obtain the exact partition function. For comparison, we also
revisit the theory on S$^2$ and perform a parallel computation. We refine the
notion of equivariant supersymmetry and use appropriate functional integration
measure. For AdS$_2$ we choose a supersymmetric boundary condition which is
compatible with the principle of variation. To evaluate the 1-loop determinant
about the localization saddle, we use index theory and fixed point formula,
where we pay attention to the effect of zero modes and their superpartners. The
existence of fermionic superpartner of 1-form boundary zero modes is proven.
Obtaining the 1-loop determinant requires expansion of the index that presents
an ambiguity, which we resolve using boundary condition. The resulting
partition function reveals an overall dependence on the size of the background
manifold, AdS$_2$ as well as S$^2$, as a sum of two types of contributions: a
local one from local conformal anomaly through the index computation and a
global one coming from zero modes. This overall size dependence is confirmed by
the perturbative 1-loop evaluation using heat kernel method.

per-class accuracy. Tested over 153 machine learning datasets we demonstrate
that Classy Ensemble outperforms two other well-known aggregation algorithms --

with deep networks, over four image datasets: Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100,

					<dc:title>Probing the baryon mass fraction in IGM and its redshift evolution with

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We investigate the fraction of baryon mass in intergalactic medium
($f_\mathrm{IGM}$), using 18 well-localized FRBs in the redshift range $z\in
(0.0039,0.66)$. We construct a five-parameter Bayesian inference model, with
the probability distributions of dispersion measures (DM) of IGM and host
galaxy properly taken into account. To check the possible redshift evolution,
we parameterize $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ as a mildly evolving function of redshift,
$f_\mathrm{IGM}=f_\mathrm{IGM,0}[1+\alpha z/(1+z)]$. By simultaneously
constraining five parameters, we get $f_\mathrm{IGM,0} = 0.92^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$
and $\alpha = 0.49^{+0.59}_{-0.47}$, and the median value of DM of host galaxy
is $\exp(\mu)=72.49^{+33.31}_{-25.62}~{\rm pc ~ cm ^ {-3}}$. By fixing two
parameters which can be constrained independently with other observations, we
obtain $\alpha =0.11^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$ in the three-parameter fit, which is
consistent with zero within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations show
that even 300 FRBs are not enough to tightly constrain five parameters
simultaneously. This is mainly caused by the correlation between parameters.
Only if two parameters are fixed, 100 FRBs are necessary to achieve unbiased
constraints on the remaining parameters.

					<dc:description>  Physical vapor deposition can be used to prepare highly stable organic glass
systems where the molecules show orientational and translational ordering at
the nanoscale. We have used low-dose four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D STEM), enabled by a fast direct electron detector, to
map columnar order in glassy samples of a discotic mesogen using a 2 nm probe.
Both vapor deposited and liquid cooled glassy films show domains of similar
orientation, but their size varies from tens to hundreds of nanometers,
depending on processing. Domain sizes are consistent with surface diffusion
mediated ordering during film deposition. These results demonstrate the ability
of low-dose 4D STEM to characterize mesoscale structure in a molecular glass
system which may be relevant to organic electronics.

					<dc:description>  Exoplanetary science is a very active field of astronomy nowadays, with
questions still opened such as how planetary systems form and evolve
(occurrence, process), why such a diversity of exoplanets is observed (mass,
radius, orbital parameters, temperature, composition), and what are the
interactions between planets, circumstellar disk and their host star. Several
complementary methods are used for the detection of exoplanets. Among these,
imaging aims at the direct detection of the light reflected, scattered or
emitted by exoplanets and circumstellar disks. This allows their spectral and
polarimetric characterization. Such imaging remains challenging because of the
large luminosity ratio (1e4-1e10$) and the small angular separation (fraction
of an arcsecond) between the star and its environment. Over the past two
decades, numerous techniques, including coronagraphy, have been developed to
make exoplanet imaging a reality.
  This review gives a broad overview of the subsystems that make up a
coronagraphic instrument for imaging exoplanetary systems. It is especially
intended for non-specialists or newcomers in the field. We explain the
principle of coronagraphy and propose a formalism to understand their behavior.
We discuss the impact of wavefront aberrations on the performance of
coronagraphs and how they induce stellar speckles in the scientific image.
Finally, we present instrumental and signal processing techniques used for
on-sky minimization or a posteriori calibration of these speckles in order to
improve the performance of coronagraphs.

					<dc:description>  We explore the rich nature of correlations in the ground state of ultracold
atoms trapped in state-dependent optical lattices. In particular, we consider
interacting fermionic ytterbium or strontium atoms, realizing a two-orbital
Hubbard model with two spin components. We analyze the model in one-dimensional
setting with the experimentally relevant hierarchy of tunneling and interaction
amplitudes by means of exact diagonalization and matrix product states
approaches, and study the correlation functions in density, spin, and orbital
sectors as functions of variable densities of atoms in the ground and
metastable excited states. We show that in certain ranges of densities these
atomic systems demonstrate strong density-wave, ferro- and antiferromagnetic,
as well as antiferroorbital correlations.

					<dc:description>  Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large
Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building
block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in
sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing
subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be
combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in
capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement
for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long
convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on
sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves
accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and
other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a
new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language
modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer
quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length
2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence
length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.

					<dc:description>  Based on the extended hadronic transport model of relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, the incompressibility of dense hadronic matter created in
relativistic Au+Au heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV is studied.
By comparing experimental proton directed flow, productions of strange hadrons
$\phi$, $K^{-}$ as well as their ratio $\phi/K^{-}$, proton high-order
cumulants to the model calculations, a large incompressibility of dense
hadronic matter is obtained from nucleon observabels while a rather small
incompressibility is needed to fit the data of strange hadrons. This may
indicate hadronic matter possesses different incompressibilities in different
density regions, i.e., the incompressibility may become stiffer from saturation
density to a certain baryon density and then turn to soft before reaching
hadron-quark phase transition. The study also shows that the incompressibility
significantly affects the critical baryon density of hadron-quark phase
transition.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for addressing the rising
privacy and security issues. Its main ingredient is to cooperatively learn the
model among the distributed clients without uploading any sensitive data. In
this paper, we conducted a thorough review of the related works, following the
development context and deeply mining the key technologies behind FL from both
theoretical and practical perspectives. Specifically, we first classify the
existing works in FL architecture based on the network topology of FL systems
with detailed analysis and summarization. Next, we abstract the current
application problems, summarize the general techniques and frame the
application problems into the general paradigm of FL base models. Moreover, we
provide our proposed solutions for model training via FL. We have summarized
and analyzed the existing FedOpt algorithms, and deeply revealed the
algorithmic development principles of many first-order algorithms in depth,
proposing a more generalized algorithm design framework. Based on these
frameworks, we have instantiated FedOpt algorithms. As privacy and security is
the fundamental requirement in FL, we provide the existing attack scenarios and
the defense methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first tier
to review the theoretical methodology and propose our strategies since there
are very few works surveying the theoretical approaches. Our survey targets
motivating the development of high-performance, privacy-preserving, and secure
methods to integrate FL into real-world applications.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a general framework for the design and analysis of
exchange mechanisms between two assets that unifies and enables comparisons
between the two dominant paradigms for exchange, constant function market
markers (CFMMs) and limit order books (LOBs). In our framework, each liquidity
provider (LP) submits to the exchange a downward-sloping demand curve,
specifying the quantity of the risky asset it wishes to hold at each price; the
exchange buys and sells the risky asset so as to satisfy the aggregate
submitted demand. In general, such a mechanism is budget-balanced and enables
price discovery. Different exchange mechanisms correspond to different
restrictions on the set of acceptable demand curves. The primary goal of this
paper is to formalize an approximation-complexity trade-off that pervades the
design of exchange mechanisms. For example, CFMMs give up expressiveness in
favor of simplicity: the aggregate demand curve of the LPs can be described
using constant space, but most demand curves cannot be well approximated by any
function in the corresponding single-dimensional family. LOBs, intuitively,
make the opposite trade-off: any downward-slowing demand curve can be well
approximated by a collection of limit orders, but the space needed to describe
the state of a LOB can be large. This paper introduces a general measure of
{\em exchange complexity}, defined by the minimal set of basis functions that
generate, through their conical hull, all of the demand functions allowed by an
exchange. With this complexity measure in place, we investigate the design of
{\em optimally expressive} exchange mechanisms, meaning the lowest complexity
mechanisms that allow for arbitrary downward-sloping demand curves to be well
approximated. As a case study, we interpret the complexity-approximation
trade-offs in the widely-used Uniswap v3 AMM through the lens of our framework.

					<dc:title>Capacity of Sun-driven Lunar Swingby Sequences and Their Application in
  Asteroid Retrieval</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Chen, Hongru</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  For deep-space mission design, the gravity of the Sun and the Moon can be
first considered and utilized. Their gravity can provide the energy change for
launching spacecraft and retrieving spacecraft as well as asteroids. Regarding
an asteroid retrieval mission, it can lead to mitigation of asteroid hazards
and easy exploration and exploitation of the asteroid. This paper discusses the
application of the Sun-driven lunar swingby sequence for asteroid missions. To
characterize the capacity of this technique is not only interesting in terms of
dynamic insights but also non-trivial for trajectory design. This paper
elucidates the capacity of a Sun-driven lunar swingby sequence with the help of
the &quot;Swingby-Jacobi&quot; graph. The capacity can be represented by a range of
Jacobi integral that encloses around 660 asteroids currently cataloged. To
facilitate trajectory design, a database of Sun-perturbed Moon-to-Moon
transfers including multi-revolution cases is generated and employed. Massive
trajectory options for spacecraft launch and asteroid capture can then be
explored and optimized. Finally, a number of asteroid flyby, rendezvous,
sample-return, and retrieval mission options enabled by the proposed technique
are obtained.

					<dc:description>  Text-to-image personalization aims to teach a pre-trained diffusion model to
reason about novel, user provided concepts, embedding them into new scenes
guided by natural language prompts. However, current personalization approaches
struggle with lengthy training times, high storage requirements or loss of
identity. To overcome these limitations, we propose an encoder-based
domain-tuning approach. Our key insight is that by underfitting on a large set
of concepts from a given domain, we can improve generalization and create a
model that is more amenable to quickly adding novel concepts from the same
domain. Specifically, we employ two components: First, an encoder that takes as
an input a single image of a target concept from a given domain, e.g. a
specific face, and learns to map it into a word-embedding representing the
concept. Second, a set of regularized weight-offsets for the text-to-image
model that learn how to effectively ingest additional concepts. Together, these
components are used to guide the learning of unseen concepts, allowing us to
personalize a model using only a single image and as few as 5 training steps -
accelerating personalization from dozens of minutes to seconds, while
preserving quality.

					<dc:description>  Accurate channel modeling and simulation tools are vital for studying sub-THz
and millimeter (mmWave) wideband communication system performance. To
accurately design future high data rate, low latency wireless modems, the
entire protocol stack must be appropriately modeled to understand how the
physical layer impacts the end-to-end performance experienced by the end user.
This paper presents a full stack end-to-end performance analysis in ns-3 using
drop-based NYU channel model (NYUSIM) and 3GPP statistical channel model (SCM)
in scenarios, namely urban microcell (UMi), urban macrocell (UMa), rural
macrocell (RMa), and indoor hotspot (InH) at 28 GHz with 100 MHz bandwidth.
Video data is transmitted at 50 Mbps using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and we
observe that the RMa channel is benign in non-line of sight (NLOS) for NYUSIM
and 3GPP SCM as it exhibits no packet drops and yields maximum throughput (48.1
Mbps) and latency of $\sim$ 20 ms. In NLOS, for NYUSIM, the UMa and RMa
channels are similar in terms of throughput and packet drops, and the latency
in UMi and InH scenarios is 10 times and 25 times higher respectively compared
to UMa. Our results indicate that mmWave bands can support data rates of 50
Mbps with negligible packet drops and latency below 150 ms in all scenarios
using NYUSIM.

					<dc:description>  It is known that a source-free Yang-Mills theory with the normal conformal
Cartan connection used as the gauge potential gives rise to equations of motion
equivalent to the vanishing of the Bach tensor. We investigate the conformally
invariant presymplectic potential current obtained from this theory and find
that on the solutions to the Einstein field equations, it can be decomposed
into a topological term derived from the Euler density and a part proportional
to the potential of the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. The pullback of
our potential to the asymptotic boundary of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes
turns out to coincide with the current obtained from the holographically
renormalized gravitational action. This provides an alternative derivation of a
symplectic structure on scri without resorting to holographic techniques. We
also calculate our current at the null infinity of asymptotically flat
spacetimes and in particular show that it vanishes for variations induced by
the BMS symmetries. In addition, we calculate the Noether currents and charges
corresponding to gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms.

be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete
examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on

					<dc:description>  $^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F is believed to be the primary means of
stellar nucleosynthesis of fluorine. Here we present the use of a single-fluid
bubble chamber to measure the cross section of the time-inverse
photo-dissociation reaction. The method benefits from a luminosity increase of
several orders of magnitude due to the use of a thicker liquid target -- when
compared to thin films or gas targets -- and from the reciprocity theorem. We
discuss the results of an experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, where the cross section of the photodisintegration
process $^{19}$F($\gamma$, $\alpha$)$^{15}$N was measured by bombarding a
superheated fluid of C$_3$F$_8$ with bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays produced by
impinging a 4 - 5.5 MeV electron beam on a Cu radiator. From the
photodissociation yield the cross section was extracted by performing a
convolution with a Monte Carlo-generated $\gamma$-ray beam spectrum. The
measurement produced a cross section that was then time inverted using the
reciprocity theorem. The cross section for the
$^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F reaction was determined down to a value in
the range of hundreds of picobarns. With further improvements of the
experimental setup the technique could potentially push cross section
measurements down to the single picobarn range.

					<dc:title>VIPeR: Provably Efficient Algorithm for Offline RL with Neural Function
  Approximation</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Nguyen-Tang, Thanh</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Arora, Raman</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning called Value
Iteration with Perturbed Rewards (VIPeR), which amalgamates the pessimism
principle with random perturbations of the value function. Most current offline
RL algorithms explicitly construct statistical confidence regions to obtain
pessimism via lower confidence bounds (LCB), which cannot easily scale to
complex problems where a neural network is used to estimate the value
functions. Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the
offline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d. Gaussian noises to
learn an ensemble of estimated state-action {value functions} and acting
greedily with respect to the minimum of the ensemble. The estimated
state-action values are obtained by fitting a parametric model (e.g., neural
networks) to the perturbed datasets using gradient descent. As a result, VIPeR
only needs $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time complexity for action selection, while
LCB-based algorithms require at least $\Omega(K^2)$, where $K$ is the total
number of trajectories in the offline data. We also propose a novel
data-splitting technique that helps remove a factor involving the log of the
covering number in our bound. We prove that VIPeR yields a provable uncertainty
quantifier with overparameterized neural networks and enjoys a bound on
sub-optimality of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( { \kappa H^{5/2} \tilde{d}
}/{\sqrt{K}})$, where $\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension, $H$ is the
horizon length and $\kappa$ measures the distributional shift. We corroborate
the statistical and computational efficiency of VIPeR with an empirical
evaluation on a wide set of synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of
our knowledge, VIPeR is the first algorithm for offline RL that is provably
efficient for general Markov decision processes (MDPs) with neural network
function approximation.

					<dc:description>  We report a detailed study of features of electron-impact excitation (EIE) of
Ca IV for the first time using the relativistic Breit-Pauli R-Matrix method
with a large close coupling wavefunction expansion of 54 fine structure levels
belonging to n=2,3,4 complexes. Our study predicts presence of a strong 3.2
$\mu$m emission line in IR. The EIE collision strength ($\Omega$) shows
extensive resonances with enhanced background resulting in an effective
collision strength ($\gamma$) of 2.2 at about 10,000 K that increases to 9.66
around 300,000 K. The present results include collision strength of all 1431
excitations among the 54 levels and effective collision strength for a limited
number of transitions of possible interest. We have found extensive resonances
in the low energy region, convergence of the resonances, and of the partial
waves with the 54 levels wavefunction. At higher energy, the collision strength
decreases beyond the resonance region for forbidden transitions, is almost
constant or decreases slowly for dipole-allowed transitions with low oscillator
strengths, and rises with Bethe-Coulomb behavior of ln(E)to almost a plateau
for transitions with high f-values.

					<dc:description>  Assuming the entropy associated with the apparent horizon of
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe has the form of the generalized
Kaniadakis entropy, and adopting the thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we
explore the effects of the modified Kaniadakis entropy on the dynamical

					<dc:description>  A differential algebra with weight is an abstraction of both the derivation
(weight zero) and the forward and backward difference operators (weight $\pm
1$). In 2010 Loday established the Koszul duality for the operad of
differential algebras of weight zero. He did not treat the case of nonzero
weight, noting that new techniques are needed since the operad is no longer
quadratic. This paper continues Loday's work and establishes the Koszul duality
in the case of nonzero weight. In the process, the minimal model and the Koszul
dual homotopy cooperad of the operad governing differential algebras with
weight are determined. As a consequence, a notion of homotopy differential
algebras with weight is obtained and the deformation complex as well as its
$L_\infty$-algebra structure for differential algebras with weight are deduced.

					<dc:description>  Feature Selection (FS), such as filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, aims
to find the optimal feature subset for a given downstream task. However, in
many real-world practices, 1) the criteria of FS vary across domains; 2) FS is
brittle when data is a high-dimensional and small sample size. Can selected
feature subsets be more generalized, accurate, and input dimensionality
agnostic? We generalize this problem into a deep differentiable feature
selection task and propose a new perspective: discrete feature subsetting as
continuous embedding space optimization. We develop a generic and principled
framework including a deep feature subset encoder, accuracy evaluator, decoder,
and gradient ascent optimizer. This framework implements four steps: 1)
features-accuracy training data preparation; 2) deep feature subset embedding;
3) gradient-optimized search; 4) feature subset reconstruction. We develop new
technical insights: reinforcement as a training data generator, ensembles of
diverse peer and exploratory feature selector knowledge for generalization, an
effective embedding from feature subsets to continuous space along with joint
optimizing reconstruction and accuracy losses to select accurate features.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

					<dc:description>  Intrinsic exchange bias up to 12.6 kOe is observed in
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) (0&lt;=x+y&lt;=3) epitaxial thin films
where 0.15&lt;=y&lt;=2. An interfacial layer of rock-salt structure emerges between
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4 thin films and {\alpha}-Al2O3 substrates and is proposed as the
antiferromagnetic layer unidirectionally coupled with ferrimagnetic
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4. In NiCo2O4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) films, results of
reflection high energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
X-ray reflectometry, and polarized neutron reflectometry support that the
interfacial layer is antiferromagnetic NixCo1-xO (0.32&lt;=x&lt;=0.49) of rock-salt
structure; the interfacial layer and exchange bias can be controlled by growth
oxygen pressure revealing the key role of oxygen in the mechanism of the
interfacial reconstruction. This work establishes a family of intrinsic
exchange bias materials with great tunability by stoichiometry and growth
parameters and emphasizes the strategy of interface engineering in controlling
material functionalities.

					<dc:description>  Late Professor M. J. D. Powell designed five trust-region derivative-free
optimization methods, namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA. He
also carefully implemented them into publicly available solvers, which are
renowned for their robustness and efficiency. However, the solvers were
implemented in Fortran 77 and hence may not be easily accessible to some users.
We introduce the PDFO package, which provides user-friendly Python and MATLAB
interfaces to Powell's code. With PDFO, users of such languages can call
Powell's Fortran solvers easily without dealing with the Fortran code.
Moreover, PDFO includes bug fixes and improvements, which are particularly
important for handling problems that suffer from ill-conditioning or failures
of function evaluations. In addition to the PDFO package, we provide an
overview of Powell's methods, sketching them from a uniform perspective,
summarizing their main features, and highlighting the similarities and
interconnections among them. We also present some experiments on PDFO to
demonstrate its stability under noise, tolerance of failures in function
evaluations, and potential in solving certain hyperparameter optimization
problems.

					<dc:description>  The isotopic mass of constituent elements of materials has a well-known
effect on the energy of vibrational modes. By means of monochromated scanning
transmission electron microscopy we have experimentally studied the phonon
bandstructure of hexagonal BN, where a phonon band gap appears between in-plane
optical phonon modes and the lower energy part of the phonon spectrum. The size
of the phonon band gap can be manipulated by the isotopic mass of the boron.
While in $^{11}$BN the phonon band gap is about 7 meV wide, in $^{10}$BN the
gap nearly closes, being an order of magnitude smaller (below 0.5 meV). This
opens exciting options for manipulating terahertz wave propagation through
isotopically structured devices having otherwise no interfaces between
chemically distinct components.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in making
accurate predictions for computer vision, natural language processing, as well
as science and engineering domains. However, it is also well-recognized that
DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This
can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous
driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification
(UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction
accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is
of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and
compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly
focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture
perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that
each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate
UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic
taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data
uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ
methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different
machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement
learning). We also identify current research gaps and propose several future
research directions.

					<dc:description>  The growing popularity of neuro symbolic reasoning has led to the adoption of
various forms of differentiable (i.e., fuzzy) first order logic. We introduce
PyReason, a software framework based on generalized annotated logic that both
captures the current cohort of differentiable logics and temporal extensions to
support inference over finite periods of time with capabilities for open world
reasoning. Further, PyReason is implemented to directly support reasoning over
graphical structures (e.g., knowledge graphs, social networks, biological
networks, etc.), produces fully explainable traces of inference, and includes
various practical features such as type checking and a memory-efficient
implementation. This paper reviews various extensions of generalized annotated
logic integrated into our implementation, our modern, efficient Python-based
implementation that conducts exact yet scalable deductive inference, and a
suite of experiments. PyReason is available at: github.com/lab-v2/pyreason.

					<dc:description>  We present a novel algorithm for learning-based loop-closure for SLAM
(simultaneous localization and mapping) applications. Our approach is designed
for general 3D point cloud data, including those from lidar, and is used to
prevent accumulated drift over time for autonomous driving. We voxelize the
point clouds into coarse voxels and calculate the overlap to estimate if the
vehicle drives in a loop. We perform point-level registration to compute the
current pose accurately. We have evaluated our approach on well-known datasets
KITTI, KITTI-360, Nuscenes, Complex Urban, NCLT, and MulRan. We show at most 2
times improvement in accuracy estimation of translation and rotation. On some
challenging sequences, our method is the first approach that can obtain a 100%
success rate.

					<dc:description>  The realization of chiral anomaly in condensed matter physics has attracted
tremendous interest in exploring unexpected phenomena of quantum field theory.
Recent studies of chiral anomaly have been limited to three spatial dimensions.
Here, we show that one-dimensional (1D) chiral anomaly can be realized in a
paradigmatic generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where a single
gapless Dirac cone occurs. We reveal that such 1D chiral anomaly leads to the
half-integer quantization of topological Thouless pump and the anomalous
dynamics of chiral displacement. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of 1D
chiral anomaly with respect to two typical types of disorder, i.e., on-site
disorder and bond disorder. The results show that the on-site disorder tends to
smear the gapless Dirac cone. However, we propose a strategy to stabilize the
half-integer quantization, facilitating its experimental detection.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bond disorder causes a crossover with
disorder-enhanced topological charge pumping, driving the system into a
topological Anderson insulator phase.

					<dc:description>  This paper deals with state estimation of stochastic models with linear state
dynamics, continuous or discrete in time. The emphasis is laid on a numerical
solution to the state prediction by the time-update step of the
grid-point-based point-mass filter (PMF), which is the most computationally
demanding part of the PMF algorithm. A novel way of manipulating the grid,
leading to the time-update in form of a convolution, is proposed. This reduces
the PMF time complexity from quadratic to log-linear with respect to the number
of grid points. Furthermore, the number of unique transition probability values
is greatly reduced causing a significant reduction of the data storage needed.
The proposed PMF prediction step is verified in a numerical study.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Classical Analysis and ODEs</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>42A50</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We give a simplified proof of the NTV conjecture for the Hilbert transform
that was proved by T. Hyt\&quot;onen, M. Lacey, E.T. Sawyer, C.-Y. Shen and I.
Uriarte-Tuero, building on previous work of F. Nazarov, S. Treil and A.
Volberg. Our proof shows a bit more, namely that the Hilbert transform is
bounded from one weighted space to another if and only if the two local testing
conditions hold and the classical offset Muckenhoupt condition holds. The proof
avoids the use of functional energy, two weight inequalities for Poisson
integrals, and recursion of admissible collections of pairs of intervals, but
retains the bottom-up corona construction, and a variant of the straddling
lemmas, from M. Lacey. Finally, the proof can be extended to certain
generalizations of fractional singular integral operators on the real line,
without assuming a classical energy condition.

					<dc:description>  The scheduling of production resources (such as associating jobs to machines)
plays a vital role for the manufacturing industry not only for saving energy
but also for increasing the overall efficiency. Among the different job
scheduling problems, the JSSP is addressed in this work. JSSP falls into the
category of NP-hard COP, in which solving the problem through exhaustive search
becomes unfeasible. Simple heuristics such as FIFO, LPT and metaheuristics such
as Taboo search are often adopted to solve the problem by truncating the search
space. The viability of the methods becomes inefficient for large problem sizes
as it is either far from the optimum or time consuming. In recent years, the
research towards using DRL to solve COP has gained interest and has shown
promising results in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. In
this work, we provide an novel approach to solve the JSSP examining the
objectives generalization and solution effectiveness using DRL. In particular,
we employ the PPO algorithm that adopts the policy-gradient paradigm that is
found to perform well in the constrained dispatching of jobs. We incorporated
an OSM in the environment to achieve better generalized learning of the
problem. The performance of the presented approach is analyzed in depth by
using a set of available benchmark instances and comparing our results with the
work of other groups.

					<dc:description>  This article establishes non-asymptotic ergodic bounds in the renormalized,
weighted Kantorovich-Wasserstein-Rubinstein distance for a viscous energy shell
lattice model of turbulence with random energy injection. The obtained bounds
turn out to be asymptotically sharp and establish abrupt thermalization. The
types of noise under consideration are Gaussian and symmetric $\alpha$-stable,
white and stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, respectively, as well as general
L\'evy noise with second moments. Furthermore we establish the absence of
abrupt thermalization in the inviscid limit case.

					<dc:description>  Motivated by recent findings on the derivation of parametric non-involutive
solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation we reconstruct the underlying algebraic
structures, called near braces. Using the notion of the near braces we produce
new multi-parametric, non-degenerate, non-involutive solutions of the
set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. These solutions are generalisations of the
known ones coming from braces and skew braces. Bijective maps associated to the
inverse solutions are also constructed. Furthermore, we introduce the
generalized notion of p-deformed braided groups and p-braidings and we show
that every p-braiding is a solution of the braid equation. We also show that
certain multi-parametric maps within the near braces provide special cases of
p-braidings.

					<dc:description>  ML platforms help enable intelligent data-driven applications and maintain
them with limited engineering effort. Upon sufficiently broad adoption, such
platforms reach economies of scale that bring greater component reuse while
improving efficiency of system development and maintenance. For an end-to-end
ML platform with broad adoption, scaling relies on pervasive ML automation and
system integration to reach the quality we term self-serve that we define with
ten requirements and six optional capabilities. With this in mind, we identify
long-term goals for platform development, discuss related tradeoffs and future
work. Our reasoning is illustrated on two commercially-deployed end-to-end ML
platforms that host hundreds of real-time use cases -- one general-purpose and
one specialized.

					<dc:description>  Learning to detect, characterize and accommodate novelties is a challenge
that agents operating in open-world domains need to address to be able to
guarantee satisfactory task performance. Certain novelties (e.g., changes in
environment dynamics) can interfere with the performance or prevent agents from
accomplishing task goals altogether. In this paper, we introduce general
methods and architectural mechanisms for detecting and characterizing different
types of novelties, and for building an appropriate adaptive model to
accommodate them utilizing logical representations and reasoning methods. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in evaluations performed
by a third party in the adversarial multi-agent board game Monopoly. The
results show high novelty detection and accommodation rates across a variety of
novelty types, including changes to the rules of the game, as well as changes
to the agent's action capabilities.

					<dc:description>  Steelmaking contributes 8% to the total CO2 emissions globally, primarily due
to coal-based iron ore reduction. Clean hydrogen-based ironmaking has variable
performance because the dominant gas-solid reduction mechanism is set by the
defects and pores inside the mm-nm sized oxide particles that change
significantly as the reaction progresses. While these governing dynamics are
essential to establish continuous flow of iron and its ores through reactors,
the direct link between agglomeration and chemistry is still contested due to
missing measurements. In this work, we directly measure the connection between
chemistry and agglomeration in the smallest iron oxides relevant to magnetite
ores. Using synthesized spherical 10-nm magnetite particles reacting in H2, we
resolve the formation and consumption of w\&quot;ustite (FeO) - the step most
commonly attributed to agglomeration. Using X-ray scattering and microscopy, we
resolve crystallographic anisotropy in the rate of the initial reaction, which
becomes isotropic as the material sinters. Complementing with imaging, we
demonstrate how the particles self-assemble, subsequently react and sinter into
~100x oblong grains. Our insights into how morphologically uniform iron oxide
particles react and agglomerate H2 reduction enable future size-dependent
models to effectively describe the multiscale iron ore reduction.

					<dc:description>  Rotating systems in thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous in our world. In the
context of high energy physics, rotations would affect the phase structure of
QCD. However, the standard Monte-Carlo methods in rotating systems are
problematic because the chemical potentials for the angular momenta (angular
velocities) cause sign problems even for bosonic variables. In this article, we
demonstrate that the complex Langevin method (CLM) may overcome this issue. We
apply the CLM to the Yang-Mills (YM) type one-dimensional matrix model (matrix
quantum mechanics) that is a large-$N$ reduction (or dimensional reduction) of
the $(D+1)$-dimensional U$(N)$ pure YM theory (bosonic BFSS model). This model
shows a large-$N$ phase transition at finite temperature, which is analogous to
the confinement/deconfinement transition of the original YM theory, and our CLM
predicts that the transition temperature decreases as the angular momentum
chemical potential increases. In order to verify our results, we compute
several quantities via the minimum sensitivity method and find good
quantitative agreements. Hence, the CLM properly works in this rotating system.
We also argue that our results are qualitatively consistent with a holography
and the recent studies of the imaginary angular velocity in QCD. As a
byproduct, we develop an analytic approximation to treat the so-called ``small
black hole&quot; phase in the matrix model.

					<dc:description>  In this paper the Casimir energy density, loop corrections, and generation of
topological mass are investigated for a system consisting of two interacting
real and complex scalar fields. The interaction considered is the quartic
interaction in the form of a product of the modulus square of the complex field
and the square of the real field. In addition, it is also considered the
self-interaction associated with each field. In this theory, the scalar field
is constrained to always obey periodic condition while the complex field obeys
in one case a quasiperiodic condition and in other case mixed boundary
conditions. The Casimir energy density, loop corrections, and topological mass
are evaluated analytically for the massive and massless scalar fields
considered. An analysis of possible different stable vacuum states and the
corresponding stability condition is also provided. In order to better
understand our investigation, some graphs are also presented. The formalism we
use here to perform such investigation is the effective potential, which is
written as loop expansions via path integral in quantum field theory.

					<dc:title>On the determination of the 3D velocity field in terms of conserved
  variables in a compressible ocean</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Tailleux, Remi</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Fluid Dynamics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Explicit expressions of the 3D velocity field in terms of the conserved
quantities of ideal fluid thermocline theory, namely Bernoulli function,
density, and potential vorticity, are generalised here to a compressible ocean
with a realistic nonlinear equation of state. The most general such expression
is the `inactive wind' solution, an exact nonlinear solution of the inviscid
compressible Navier-Stokes that satisfies the continuity equation as a
consequence of Ertel's potential vorticity theorem. Such expressions are shown
to be non-unique due to the non-uniqueness of the choice of Bernoulli function
and in general approximately differ by the magnitude of their vertical velocity
component. Due to the thermobaric nonlinearity of the equation of state, the
expression of the 3D velocity field for a compressible ocean is found to
resemble its ideal fluid counterpart only if constructed in terms of the
available form of Bernoulli function as per Lorenz theory of available
potential energy (APE). APE theory also naturally defines a quasi-material
approximately neutral density variable called Lorenz reference density, which
in turn defines a potential vorticity variable minimally affected by
thermobaric production, thus providing all necessary tools for extending most
results of ideal fluid thermocline theory to a compressible ocean.

					<dc:description>  Printed Electronics (PE) exhibits on-demand, extremely low-cost hardware due
to its additive manufacturing process, enabling machine learning (ML)
applications for domains that feature ultra-low cost, conformity, and
non-toxicity requirements that silicon-based systems cannot deliver.
Nevertheless, large feature sizes in PE prohibit the realization of complex
printed ML circuits. In this work, we present, for the first time, an automated
printed-aware software/hardware co-design framework that exploits approximate
computing principles to enable ultra-resource constrained printed multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs). Our evaluation demonstrates that, compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline, our circuits feature on average 6x (5.7x) lower area
(power) and less than 1% accuracy loss.

vicinity of the fluid system's lowest natural frequency. We provide

					<dc:description>  Discriminative representation is essential to keep a unique identifier for
each target in Multiple object tracking (MOT). Some recent MOT methods extract
features of the bounding box region or the center point as identity embeddings.
However, when targets are occluded, these coarse-grained global representations
become unreliable. To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained
representation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and
local perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature
resolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the
semantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information
aggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature
alignment aggregation. It generates semantic flow among feature maps from
different resolutions to transform their pixel positions. Furthermore, we
present a Multi-head Part Mask Generator (MPMG) to extract fine-grained
representation based on the aligned feature maps. Multiple parallel branches of
MPMG allow it to focus on different parts of targets to generate local masks
without label supervision. The diverse details in target masks facilitate
fine-grained representation. Eventually, benefiting from a Shuffle-Group
Sampling (SGS) training strategy with positive and negative samples balanced,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MOT17 and MOT20 test sets. Even on
DanceTrack, where the appearance of targets is extremely similar, our method
significantly outperforms ByteTrack by 5.0% on HOTA and 5.6% on IDF1. Extensive
experiments have proved that diverse fine-grained representation makes Re-ID
great again in MOT.

					<dc:description>  Achieving and maintaining cooperation between agents to accomplish a common
objective is one of the central goals of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). Nevertheless in many real-world scenarios, separately trained and
specialized agents are deployed into a shared environment, or the environment
requires multiple objectives to be achieved by different coexisting parties.
These variations among specialties and objectives are likely to cause mixed
motives that eventually result in a social dilemma where all the parties are at
a loss. In order to resolve this issue, we propose the Incentive Q-Flow
(IQ-Flow) algorithm, which modifies the system's reward setup with an incentive
regulator agent such that the cooperative policy also corresponds to the
self-interested policy for the agents. Unlike the existing methods that learn
to incentivize self-interested agents, IQ-Flow does not make any assumptions
about agents' policies or learning algorithms, which enables the generalization
of the developed framework to a wider array of applications. IQ-Flow performs
an offline evaluation of the optimality of the learned policies using the data
provided by other agents to determine cooperative and self-interested policies.
Next, IQ-Flow uses meta-gradient learning to estimate how policy evaluation
changes according to given incentives and modifies the incentive such that the
greedy policy for cooperative objective and self-interested objective yield the
same actions. We present the operational characteristics of IQ-Flow in Iterated
Matrix Games. We demonstrate that IQ-Flow outperforms the state-of-the-art
incentive design algorithm in Escape Room and 2-Player Cleanup environments. We
further demonstrate that the pretrained IQ-Flow mechanism significantly
outperforms the performance of the shared reward setup in the 2-Player Cleanup
environment.

					<dc:description>  A system of two independent Bosonic Harmonic Oscillators is converted into

fourth-order derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator has to be performed in order
not to suffer from the divergence problems of the vacuum state and path
integrals as conjectured most recently by P. D. Mannheim in his article
``Determining the normalization of the quantum field theory vacuum, with

					<dc:description>  The role of $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetry in an effective field theory for
fermions and axions is considered in spacetime dimensions $D=4-\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon &gt;0$. The renormalisable field theory is for a Dirac field and a
pseudoscalar field, whose interactions are a Yukawa coupling $g$ and a quartic
scalar self-coupling $u$. The field theory is Hermitian or non-Hermitian (but
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) depending on whether the Yukawa coupling is imaginary
or real and the quartic coupling is positive or negative. The introduction of
$\epsilon$ allows a controlled investigation of the validity of recent work
which indicates that the quartic coupling and the square of the Yukawa coupling
(regarded as a function of scale) may change sign in a renormalisation group
flow. Renormalisation group flows in coupling constant space are investigated
using the Mathematica package RGBeta, which calculates beta functions up to
three loops in the Yukawa coupling and up to two loops in the quartic scalar
coupling. Fixed points are found for non-zero $\epsilon$, which are classified
according to their linear stability. The flows in the neighbourhood of the
non-trivial fixed points are calculated using perturbative analysis, together
with the $\epsilon$ expansion. The global flow indicates flows from positive
$u$ to negative $u$; there are no flows from imaginary $g$ to real $g$. Using
summation techniques for divergent series, we demonstrate a possible
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric saddle fixed point for $D=3$.

					<dc:description>  Quantum cryptography leverages many unique features of quantum information in
order to construct cryptographic primitives that are oftentimes impossible
classically. In this work, we build on the no-cloning principle of quantum
mechanics and design cryptographic schemes with key-revocation capabilities. We
consider schemes where secret keys are represented as quantum states with the
guarantee that, once the secret key is successfully revoked from a user, they
no longer have the ability to perform the same functionality as before. We
define and construct several fundamental cryptographic primitives with
key-revocation capabilities, namely pseudorandom functions, secret-key and
public-key encryption, and even fully homomorphic encryption, assuming the
quantum subexponential hardness of the learning with errors problem. Central to
all our constructions is our approach for making the Dual-Regev encryption
scheme (Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2008) revocable.

					<dc:title>Applying Plain Transformers to Real-World Point Clouds</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Li, Lanxiao</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Heizmann, Michael</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Due to the lack of inductive bias, transformer-based models usually require a
large amount of training data. The problem is especially concerning in 3D
vision, as 3D data are harder to acquire and annotate. To overcome this
problem, previous works modify the architecture of transformers to incorporate
inductive biases by applying, e.g., local attention and down-sampling. Although
they have achieved promising results, earlier works on transformers for point
clouds have two issues. First, the power of plain transformers is still
under-explored. Second, they focus on simple and small point clouds instead of
complex real-world ones. This work revisits the plain transformers in
real-world point cloud understanding. We first take a closer look at some
fundamental components of plain transformers, e.g., patchifier and positional
embedding, for both efficiency and performance. To close the performance gap
due to the lack of inductive bias and annotated data, we investigate
self-supervised pre-training with masked autoencoder (MAE). Specifically, we
propose drop patch, which prevents information leakage and significantly
improves the effectiveness of MAE. Our models achieve SOTA results in semantic
segmentation on the S3DIS dataset and object detection on the ScanNet dataset
with lower computational costs. Our work provides a new baseline for future
research on transformers for point clouds.

surrounding visible joints. The proposed framework involves three components:
(i) A Sparse Key-point Flow Estimating Module (SKFEM) for sampling key-points
from around body joints and estimating the motion vectors of key-points which
contribute to the refinement of body joint locations and fine-tuning of pose
estimators; (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Distance Minimizing Module (HGMM) for
evaluating the visibility scores of nodes from hierarchical graphs with the
visibility score of a node determining the number of samples around that node;
and (iii) The combination of multiple historical frames for matching
identities. Graph matching with HGMM facilitates more accurate tracking even
under partial occlusions. The proposed approach not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack dataset but also contributes to
significant improvements in human-related anomaly detection. Besides a higher
accuracy, the proposed SKFEM also shows a much higher efficiency than dense
optical flow estimation.

					<dc:creator>Dobriban, Edgar</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Lin, Zhanran</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We introduce Joint Coverage Regions (JCRs), which unify confidence intervals
and prediction regions in frequentist statistics. Specifically, joint coverage
regions aim to cover a pair formed by an unknown fixed parameter (such as the
mean of a distribution), and an unobserved random datapoint (such as the
outcomes associated to a new test datapoint). The first corresponds to a
confidence component, while the second corresponds to a prediction part. In
particular, our notion unifies classical statistical methods such as the Wald
confidence interval with distribution-free prediction methods such as conformal
prediction. We show how to construct finite-sample valid JCRs when a
conditional pivot is available; under the same conditions where exact
finite-sample confidence and prediction sets are known to exist. We further
develop efficient JCR algorithms, including split-data versions by introducing
adequate sets to reduce the cost of repeated computation. We illustrate the use
of JCRs in statistical problems such as constructing efficient prediction sets
when the parameter space is structured.

					<dc:description>  Modelling elastocaloric effect (eCE) is crucial for the design of
environmentally friendly and energy-efficient eCE based solid-state cooling
devices. Here, a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase-field model
(PFM) coupling martensitic transformation with mechanics and heat transfer is
developed and applied for simulating eCE. The model is derived from a
thermodynamic framework which invokes the microforce theory and Coleman--Noll
procedure. To avoid the numerical issue related to the non-differentiable
energy barrier function across the transition point, the austenite-martensite
transition energy barrier in PFM is constructed as a smooth function of
temperature. Both the indirect method using isothermal PFM with Maxwell
relations and the direct method using non-isothermal PFM are applied to
calculate the elastocaloric properties. The former is capable of calculating
both isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta
T_{\text{ad}}$), but induces high computation cost. The latter is
computationally efficient, but only yields $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$. In a model
Mn-22Cu alloy, the maximum $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$ ($\Delta
T_{\text{ad}}^{\text{max}}$) under a compressive stress of 100 MPa is
calculated as 9.5 and 8.5~K in single crystal (3.5 and 3.8~K in polycrystal)
from the indirect and direct method, respectively. The results demonstrate the
developed PFM herein, combined with both indirect and direct method for eCE
calculations, as a practicable toolkit for the computational design of
elastocaloric devices.

					<dc:description>  With the development of computer-assisted techniques, research communities
including biochemistry and deep learning have been devoted into the drug
discovery field for over a decade. Various applications of deep learning have
drawn great attention in drug discovery, such as molecule generation, molecular
property prediction, retrosynthesis prediction, and reaction prediction. While
most existing surveys only focus on one of the applications, limiting the view
of researchers in the community. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
review on the aforementioned four aspects, and discuss the relationships among
different applications. The latest literature and classical benchmarks are
presented for better understanding the development of variety of approaches.
  We commence by summarizing the molecule representation format in these works,
followed by an introduction of recent proposed approaches for each of the four
tasks. Furthermore, we review a variety of commonly used datasets and
evaluation metrics and compare the performance of deep learning-based models.
Finally, we conclude by identifying remaining challenges and discussing the
future trend for deep learning methods in drug discovery.

					<dc:description>  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is important in today's technology as it
enables machines to comprehend and process human language, leading to improved
human-computer interactions and advancements in fields such as virtual
assistants, chatbots, and language-based AI systems. This paper highlights the
significance of advancing the field of NLU for low-resource languages. With
intent detection and slot filling being crucial tasks in NLU, the widely used
datasets ATIS and SNIPS have been utilized in the past. However, these datasets
only cater to the English language and do not support other languages. In this
work, we aim to address this gap by creating a Persian benchmark for joint
intent detection and slot filling based on the ATIS dataset. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our benchmark, we employ state-of-the-art methods for intent
detection and slot filling.

					<dc:description>  Effectively extracting inter-frame motion and appearance information is
important for video frame interpolation (VFI). Previous works either extract
both types of information in a mixed way or elaborate separate modules for each
type of information, which lead to representation ambiguity and low efficiency.
In this paper, we propose a novel module to explicitly extract motion and
appearance information via a unifying operation. Specifically, we rethink the
information process in inter-frame attention and reuse its attention map for
both appearance feature enhancement and motion information extraction.
Furthermore, for efficient VFI, our proposed module could be seamlessly
integrated into a hybrid CNN and Transformer architecture. This hybrid pipeline
can alleviate the computational complexity of inter-frame attention as well as
preserve detailed low-level structure information. Experimental results
demonstrate that, for both fixed- and arbitrary-timestep interpolation, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. Meanwhile,
our approach enjoys a lighter computation overhead over models with close
performance. The source code and models are available at

					<dc:description>  Legged robot navigation in unstructured and slippery terrains depends heavily
on the ability to accurately identify the quality of contact between the
robot's feet and the ground. Contact state estimation is regarded as a
challenging problem and is typically addressed by exploiting force
measurements, joint encoders and/or robot kinematics and dynamics. In contrast
to most state of the art approaches, the current work introduces a novel
probabilistic method for estimating the contact state based solely on
proprioceptive sensing, as it is readily available by Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) mounted on the robot's end effectors. Capitalizing on the
uncertainty of IMU measurements, our method estimates the probability of stable
contact. This is accomplished by approximating the multimodal probability
density function over a batch of data points for each axis of the IMU with
Kernel Density Estimation. The proposed method has been extensively assessed
against both real and simulated scenarios on bipedal and quadrupedal robotic
platforms such as ATLAS, TALOS and Unitree's GO1.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we develop certain structural and representation theoretical
aspects of abstract generalized Weyl algebra and Galois algebras. The later
class of algebras has been introduced by V. Futorny and S. Ovsienko and has
lead to recent breakthroughs in representation theory. From the structure
theory side, we show how this theory provides a simple criteria to show that
certain algebras are not PI-algebras. Then we compare many classes of Galois
algebras considered recently, and show that the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture is
satisfied in a broad situation. Refining previous work, we show that the
invariants of a broad class of generalized Weyl algebras under the action of
complex reflection groups $G(m,p,n)$ are Galois orders. Finally, we consider
the lifting of maximal ideals in generalized Weyl algebras.

					<dc:description>  Imitation learning has been widely applied to various autonomous systems
thanks to recent development in interactive algorithms that address covariate
shift and compounding errors induced by traditional approaches like behavior
cloning. However, existing interactive imitation learning methods assume access
to one perfect expert. Whereas in reality, it is more likely to have multiple
imperfect experts instead. In this paper, we propose MEGA-DAgger, a new DAgger
variant that is suitable for interactive learning with multiple imperfect
experts. First, unsafe demonstrations are filtered while aggregating the
training data, so the imperfect demonstrations have little influence when
training the novice policy. Next, experts are evaluated and compared on
scenarios-specific metrics to resolve the conflicted labels among experts.
Through experiments in autonomous racing scenarios, we demonstrate that policy
learned using MEGA-DAgger can outperform both experts and policies learned
using the state-of-the-art interactive imitation learning algorithm. The

					<dc:description>  Driven by the need for larger and more diverse datasets to pre-train and
fine-tune increasingly complex machine learning models, the number of datasets
is rapidly growing. audb is an open-source Python library that supports
versioning and documentation of audio datasets. It aims to provide a
standardized and simple user-interface to publish, maintain, and access the
annotations and audio files of a dataset. To efficiently store the data on a
server, audb automatically resolves dependencies between versions of a dataset
and only uploads newly added or altered files when a new version is published.
The library supports partial loading of a dataset and local caching for fast
access. audb is a lightweight library and can be interfaced from any machine
learning library. It supports the management of datasets on a single PC, within
a university or company, or within a whole research community. audb is
available at https://github.com/audeering/audb.

					<dc:description>  We review the scaling theory of disordered itinerant electrons with e-e
interactions. We first show how to adjust the microscopic Fermi-liquid theory
to the presence of disorder. Then we describe the non-linear sigma model (NLSM)
with interactions (Finkel'stein's model). This model is closely connected to
the Fermi liquid, but is more generally applicable, since it can also be viewed
as a minimal effective functional describing disordered interacting electrons.
Our discussion emphasizes the general structure of the theory, and the
connection of the scaling parameters to conservation laws. We then move on to
discuss the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the disordered electron liquid
in two and three dimensions. This MIT is a non-trivial example of a quantum
phase transition. The NLSM approach allows to identify the dynamical exponent
connecting the spatial and energy scales, which is central for the description
of the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior in the critical region of the MIT in
three dimensions. In two dimensions, the system can be discussed in terms of a
flow in the disorder-interaction phase plane, which is controlled by a fixed
point. We demonstrate that the two-parameter RG-equations accurately describe
electrons in Si-MOSFETs including the observed non-monotonic behavior of the
resistance and its strong drop at low temperatures. The theory can also be
applied to systems with an attractive interaction in the Cooper channel, where
it describes the suppression of superconductivity in disordered amorphous
films. We extend our discussion to heat transport in the two-dimensional
electron liquid. Similar to the electric conductivity, the thermal conductivity
also acquires logarithmic corrections induced by electron interaction and
disorder. The resulting thermal conductivity can be calculated in the NLSM
formalism after introducing so-called gravitational potentials.

					<dc:description>  Routing is, arguably, the most fundamental task in computer networking, and
the most extensively studied one. A key challenge for routing in real-world
environments is the need to contend with uncertainty about future traffic
demands. We present a new approach to routing under demand uncertainty:
tackling this challenge as stochastic optimization, and employing deep learning
to learn complex patterns in traffic demands. We show that our method provably
converges to the global optimum in well-studied theoretical models of
multicommodity flow. We exemplify the practical usefulness of our approach by
zooming in on the real-world challenge of traffic engineering (TE) on wide-area
networks (WANs). Our extensive empirical evaluation on real-world traffic and
network topologies establishes that our approach's TE quality almost matches
that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle, outperforming previously proposed
approaches, and also substantially lowers runtimes.
