					<dc:description>  When mobile impurities are introduced and coupled to a Fermi sea, new
quasiparticles known as Fermi polarons are formed. There are two interesting,
yet drastically different regimes of the Fermi polaron problem: (I) the
attractive polaron (AP) branch, connected to pairing phenomena spanning the
crossover from BCS superfluidity to the Bose-Einstein condensation of
molecules; and (II) the repulsive branch (RP), which underlies the physics
responsible for Stoner's itinerant ferromagnetism. Here, we study Fermi
polarons in two dimensional systems, where many questions and debates regarding
their nature persist. The model system we investigate is a doped MoSe$_2$
monolayer. We find the observed AP-RP energy splitting and the quantum dynamics
of attractive polarons agree with the predictions of polaron theory. As the
doping density increases, the quantum dephasing of the attractive polarons
remains constant, indicative of stable quasiparticles, while the repulsive
polaron dephasing rate increases nearly quadratically. The dynamics of Fermi
polarons are of critical importance for understanding the pairing and magnetic
instabilities that lead to the formation of rich quantum phases found in a wide
range of physical systems including nuclei, cold atomic gases, and solids.

					<dc:description>  Algorithmic fairness in the context of personalized recommendation presents
significantly different challenges to those commonly encountered in
classification tasks. Researchers studying classification have generally
considered fairness to be a matter of achieving equality of outcomes between a
protected and unprotected group, and built algorithmic interventions on this
basis. We argue that fairness in real-world application settings in general,
and especially in the context of personalized recommendation, is much more
complex and multi-faceted, requiring a more general approach. We propose a
model to formalize multistakeholder fairness in recommender systems as a two
stage social choice problem. In particular, we express recommendation fairness
as a novel combination of an allocation and an aggregation problem, which
integrate both fairness concerns and personalized recommendation provisions,
and derive new recommendation techniques based on this formulation. Simulations
demonstrate the ability of the framework to integrate multiple fairness
concerns in a dynamic way.

					<dc:description>  Based on the Manhattan World assumption, most existing indoor layout
estimation schemes focus on recovering layouts from vertically compressed 1D
sequences. However, the compression procedure confuses the semantics of
different planes, yielding inferior performance with ambiguous
interpretability.
  To address this issue, we propose to disentangle this 1D representation by
pre-segmenting orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) planes from a complex
scene, explicitly capturing the geometric cues for indoor layout estimation.
Considering the symmetry between the floor boundary and ceiling boundary, we
also design a soft-flipping fusion strategy to assist the pre-segmentation.
Besides, we present a feature assembling mechanism to effectively integrate
shallow and deep features with distortion distribution awareness. To compensate
for the potential errors in pre-segmentation, we further leverage triple
attention to reconstruct the disentangled sequences for better performance.
Experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate our superiority over
existing SoTA solutions, especially on the 3DIoU metric. The code is available
at \url{https://github.com/zhijieshen-bjtu/DOPNet}.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces gemact, a Python package for actuarial modeling based
on the collective risk model. The library supports applications to costing and
risk transfers, risks aggregation, and claims reserving. We add new probability
distributions to those available in scipy, including the (a,b,0) and (a,b,1)
discrete distributions, the Archimedean and the Elliptical classes of copulas.
We provide a software implementation of the AEP algorithm for calculating the
cumulative distribution function of the sum of dependent, non-negative random
variables, given their dependency structure specified with a copula. The
theoretical framework is introduced in brief at the beginning of each section
to provide the reader with a sufficient understanding of the underlying
actuarial models.

					<dc:description>  Sharing data can often enable compelling applications and analytics. However,
more often than not, valuable datasets contain information of sensitive nature,
and thus sharing them can endanger the privacy of users and organizations. A
possible alternative gaining momentum in the research community is to share
synthetic data instead. The idea is to release artificially generated datasets
that resemble the actual data -- more precisely, having similar statistical
properties.
  So how do you generate synthetic data? What is that useful for? What are the
benefits and the risks? What are the open research questions that remain
unanswered? In this article, we provide a gentle introduction to synthetic data
and discuss its use cases, the privacy challenges that are still unaddressed,
and its inherent limitations as an effective privacy-enhancing technology.

					<dc:description>  Soft actor-critic is a successful successor over soft Q-learning. While lived
under maximum entropy framework, their relationship is still unclear. In this
paper, we prove that in the limit they converge to the same solution. This is
appealing since it translates the optimization from an arduous to an easier
way. The same justification can also be applied to other regularizers such as

					<dc:title>Shape-Driven Selection Effects for Aspherical Near-Earth Objects in
  Systematic Surveys</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Levine, W. Garrett</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Jedicke, Robert</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The apparent magnitude of elongated small bodies is time-dependent over their
rotation phase. Therefore, previously undiscovered aspherical minor planets may
experience a shape-driven selection effect in systematic surveys versus their
spherical counterparts. In this study, we conduct injection-recovery exercises
of synthetic asteroid lightcurves using a simple model to quantify the effect
of varying axial ratio on detection efficiencies. We find that high-amplitude
lightcurves are confronted with adverse selection effects for survey cadences
and discovery thresholds for constructing tracklets that are representative of
modern and proposed future NEO searches. Furthermore, we illustrate the
possible hazards of drawing population-level inferences on an underlying
reservoir of elongated small bodies. If physical size and characteristic axial
ratios are correlated, then size-frequency distributions may require revision
at small diameters. In particular, this effect could alter the estimated
populations of near-Earth objects. We conclude by discussing the applicability
of our results to various other classes of solar system minor planets and
interstellar interlopers, as well as discuss future work that may further
interrogate this detection bias.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous vehicles will be an integral part of ride-sharing services in the
future. This setting differs from traditional ride-sharing marketplaces because
of the absence of the supply side (drivers). However, it has far-reaching
consequences because in addition to pricing, players now have to make decisions
on how to distribute fleets across network locations and re-balance vehicles in
order to serve future demand. In this paper, we explore a duopoly setting in
the ride-sharing marketplace where the players have fully autonomous fleets.
Each ride-service provider (RSP)'s prices depend on the prices and the supply
of the other player. We formulate their decision-making problems using a
game-theoretic setup where each player seeks to find the optimal prices and
supplies at each node while considering the decisions of the other player. This
leads to a scenario where the players' optimization problems are coupled and it
is challenging to find the equilibrium. We characterize the types of demand
functions (e.g.: linear) for which this game admits an exact potential function
and can be solved efficiently. For other types of demand functions, we propose
an iterative algorithm to compute the equilibrium. We conclude by providing
numerical insights into how different kinds of equilibria would play out in the
market when the players are asymmetric. Our numerical evaluations also provide
insights into how the regulator needs to consider network effects while
deciding regulation in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes.

					<dc:description>  We describe the engineering of the distributed-memory multilevel graph
partitioner dKaMinPar. It scales to (at least) 8192 cores while achieving
partitioning quality comparable to widely used sequential and shared-memory
graph partitioners. In comparison, previous distributed graph partitioners
scale only in more restricted scenarios and often induce a considerable quality
penalty compared to non-distributed partitioners. When partitioning into a
large number of blocks, they even produce infeasible solution that violate the
balancing constraint. dKaMinPar achieves its robustness by a scalable
distributed implementation of the deep-multilevel scheme for graph
partitioning. Crucially, this includes new algorithms for balancing during
refinement and coarsening.

					<dc:description>  We report near-infrared polarization of the zodiacal light (ZL) measured from
space by the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic
Background Explorer in photometric bands centered at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 $\mu$m.
To constrain the physical properties of interplanetary dust (IPD), we use DIRBE
Weekly Sky Maps to investigate the solar elongation ($\epsilon$), ecliptic
latitude ($\beta$), and wavelength ($\lambda$) dependence of ZL polarization.
We find that the polarization of the ZL varies as a function of $\epsilon$ and
$\beta$, consistent with observed polarization at $\lambda$ = 550 nm. While the
polarization dependence with wavelength at $(\epsilon$, $\beta)=(90^{\circ}$,
$0^{\circ})$ is modest (increasing from 17.7 $\pm$ 0.2% at 1.25 $\mu$m to 21.0
$\pm$ 0.3% at 3.5 $\mu$m), the variation is more pronounced at the North
Ecliptic Pole (23.1 $\pm$ 1.6, 35.1 $\pm$ 2.0 and 39.3 $\pm$ 2.1% at 1.25, 2.2
and 3.5 $\mu$m, respectively). The variation of ZL polarization with wavelength
is not explained by either Rayleigh scattering or by absorptive particles
larger than 10 $\mu$m.

					<dc:title>An Improved Classical Singular Value Transformation for Quantum Machine
  Learning</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Bakshi, Ainesh</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Tang, Ewin</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Quantum machine learning (QML) has shown great potential to produce large
quantum speedups for linear algebra tasks. The quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT), introduced by [GSLW, STOC'19, arXiv:1806.01838], is a
unifying framework to obtain QML algorithms. We provide a classical algorithm
that matches the performance of QSVT on low-rank inputs, up to small polynomial
overhead. Under quantum memory assumptions, given a bounded matrix
$A\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times n}$, vector $b\in\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and bounded
degree-$d$ polynomial $p$, QSVT can output a measurement from the state
$|p(A)b\rangle$ in $O(d\|A\|_F)$ time after linear-time pre-processing. We show
that, in the same setting, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we can output a vector $v$
such that $\|v - p(A) b\|\leq\varepsilon\|b\|$ in
$O(d^9\|A\|_F^4/\varepsilon^2)$ time after linear-time pre-processing. This
improves upon the best known classical algorithm [CGLLTW, STOC'20,
arXiv:1910.06151], which requires $O(d^{22}\|A\|_F^6/\varepsilon^6)$ time.
  Instantiating the aforementioned algorithm with different polynomials, we
obtain fast quantum-inspired algorithms for regression, recommendation systems,
and Hamiltonian simulation. We improve in numerous parameter settings on prior
work, including those that use problem-specialized approaches. Our key insight
is to combine the Clenshaw recurrence, an iterative method for computing matrix
polynomials, with sketching techniques to simulate QSVT classically. The tools
we introduce in this work include (a) a matrix sketch for approximately
preserving bi-linear forms, (b) an asymmetric approximate matrix product sketch
based on $\ell_2^2$ sampling, (c) a new stability analysis for the Clenshaw
recurrence, and (d) a new technique to bound arithmetic progressions of the
coefficients appearing in the Chebyshev series expansion of bounded functions,
each of which may be of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  Various attribution methods have been developed to explain deep neural
networks (DNNs) by inferring the attribution/importance/contribution score of
each input variable to the final output. However, existing attribution methods
are often built upon different heuristics. There remains a lack of a unified
theoretical understanding of why these methods are effective and how they are
related. To this end, for the first time, we formulate core mechanisms of
fourteen attribution methods, which were designed on different heuristics, into
the same mathematical system, i.e., the system of Taylor interactions.
Specifically, we prove that attribution scores estimated by fourteen
attribution methods can all be reformulated as the weighted sum of two types of
effects, i.e., independent effects of each individual input variable and
interaction effects between input variables. The essential difference among the
fourteen attribution methods mainly lies in the weights of allocating different
effects. Based on the above findings, we propose three principles for a fair
allocation of effects to evaluate the faithfulness of the fourteen attribution
methods.

					<dc:description>  Brain surface-based image registration, an important component of brain image
analysis, establishes spatial correspondence between cortical surfaces.
Existing iterative and learning-based approaches focus on accurate registration
of folding patterns of the cerebral cortex, and assume that geometry predicts
function and thus functional areas will also be well aligned. However,
structure/functional variability of anatomically corresponding areas across
subjects has been widely reported. In this work, we introduce a learning-based
cortical registration framework, JOSA, which jointly aligns folding patterns
and functional maps while simultaneously learning an optimal atlas. We
demonstrate that JOSA can substantially improve registration performance in
both anatomical and functional domains over existing methods. By employing a
semi-supervised training strategy, the proposed framework obviates the need for
functional data during inference, enabling its use in broad neuroscientific
domains where functional data may not be observed.

					<dc:description>  We present a statistical study of 180 dust continuum sources identified in 33
massive cluster fields by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) over a total
of 133 arcmin$^{2}$ area, homogeneously observed at 1.2 mm. ALCS enables us to
detect extremely faint mm sources by lensing magnification, including
near-infrared (NIR) dark objects showing no counterparts in existing {\it
Hubble Space Telescope} and {\it Spitzer} images. The dust continuum sources
belong to a blind sample ($N=141$) with S/N $\gtrsim$ 5.0 (a purity of $&gt;$
0.99) or a secondary sample ($N=39$) with S/N= $4.0-5.0$ screened by priors.
With the blind sample, we securely derive 1.2-mm number counts down to $\sim7$
$\mu$Jy, and find that the total integrated 1.2mm flux is 20.7$^{+8.5}_{-6.5}$
Jy deg$^{-2}$, resolving $\simeq$ 80 % of the cosmic infrared background light.
The resolved fraction varies by a factor of $0.6-1.1$ due to the completeness
correction depending on the spatial size of the mm emission. We also derive
infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) at $z=0.6-7.5$ with the $1/V_{\rm
max}$ method, finding the redshift evolution of IR LFs characterized by
positive luminosity and negative density evolution. The total (=UV+IR) cosmic
star-formation rate density (SFRD) at $z&gt;4$ is estimated to be
$161^{+25}_{-21}$ % of the established measurements, which were almost
exclusively based on optical$-$NIR surveys. Although our general understanding
of the cosmic SFRD is unlikely to change beyond a factor of 2, these results
add to the weight of evidence for an additional ($\approx 60$ %) SFRD component
contributed by the faint-mm population, including NIR dark objects.

					<dc:description>  Recently, data-driven models such as deep neural networks have shown to be
promising tools for modelling and state inference in soft robots. However,
voluminous amounts of data are necessary for deep models to perform
effectively, which requires exhaustive and quality data collection,
particularly of state labels. Consequently, obtaining labelled state data for
soft robotic systems is challenged for various reasons, including difficulty in
the sensorization of soft robots and the inconvenience of collecting data in
unstructured environments. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose
a semi-supervised sequential variational Bayes (DSVB) framework for transfer
learning and state inference in soft robots with missing state labels on
certain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct
dynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer
strategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features
across multiple configurations. Unlike existing transfer learning approaches,
our proposed DSVB employs a recurrent neural network to model the nonlinear
dynamics and temporal coherence in soft robot data. The proposed framework is
validated on multiple setup configurations of a pneumatic-based soft robot
finger. Experimental results on four transfer scenarios demonstrate that DSVB
performs effective transfer learning and accurate state inference amidst
missing state labels.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, there has been a flurry of research focusing on the fairness
of machine learning models, and in particular on quantifying and eliminating
bias against protected subgroups. One line of work generalizes the notion of
protected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of
a &quot;rich subgroup&quot;, and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize
error rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely
orthogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a
classifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to
the individual features of x. This raises a natural question: Do local model
explanation methods attribute different feature importance values on average
across different protected subgroups, and can we detect these disparities
efficiently? If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific
protected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could
be a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data
generating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals
the need for a domain expert to delve deeper. In this paper, we formally
introduce the notion of feature importance disparity (FID) in the context of
rich subgroups, design oracle-efficent algorithms to identify large FID
subgroups, and conduct a thorough empirical analysis that establishes auditing
for FID as an important method to investigate dataset bias. Our experiments
show that across 4 datasets and 4 common feature importance methods our
algorithms find (feature, subgroup) pairs that simultaneously: (i) have
subgroup feature importance that is often an order of magnitude different than
the importance on the dataset as a whole (ii) generalize out of sample, and
(iii) yield interesting discussions about potential bias inherent in these
datasets.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study scheduling of a queueing system with zero knowledge
of instantaneous network conditions. We consider a one-hop single-server
queueing system consisting of $K$ queues, each with time-varying and
non-stationary arrival and service rates. Our scheduling approach builds on an
innovative combination of adversarial bandit learning and Lyapunov drift
minimization, without knowledge of the instantaneous network state (the arrival
and service rates) of each queue. We then present two novel algorithms
\texttt{SoftMW} (SoftMaxWeight) and \texttt{SSMW} (Sliding-window
SoftMaxWeight), both capable of stabilizing systems that can be stablized by
some (possibly unknown) sequence of randomized policies whose time-variation
satisfies a mild condition. We further generalize our results to the setting
where arrivals and departures only have bounded moments instead of being
deterministically bounded and propose \texttt{SoftMW+} and \texttt{SSMW+} that
are capable of stabilizing the system. As a building block of our new
algorithms, we also extend the classical \texttt{EXP3.S} (Auer et al., 2002)
algorithm for multi-armed bandits to handle unboundedly large feedback signals,
which can be of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  A word-as-image is a semantic typography technique where a word illustration
presents a visualization of the meaning of the word, while also preserving its
readability. We present a method to create word-as-image illustrations
automatically. This task is highly challenging as it requires semantic
understanding of the word and a creative idea of where and how to depict these
semantics in a visually pleasing and legible manner. We rely on the remarkable
ability of recent large pretrained language-vision models to distill textual
concepts visually. We target simple, concise, black-and-white designs that
convey the semantics clearly. We deliberately do not change the color or
texture of the letters and do not use embellishments. Our method optimizes the
outline of each letter to convey the desired concept, guided by a pretrained
Stable Diffusion model. We incorporate additional loss terms to ensure the
legibility of the text and the preservation of the style of the font. We show
high quality and engaging results on numerous examples and compare to
alternative techniques.

					<dc:description>  The ability to discover abstract physical concepts and understand how they
work in the world through observing lies at the core of human intelligence. The
acquisition of this ability is based on compositionally perceiving the
environment in terms of objects and relations in an unsupervised manner. Recent
approaches learn object-centric representations and capture visually observable
concepts of objects, e.g., shape, size, and location. In this paper, we take a
step forward and try to discover and represent intrinsic physical concepts such
as mass and charge. We introduce the PHYsical Concepts Inference NEtwork
(PHYCINE), a system that infers physical concepts in different abstract levels
without supervision. The key insights underlining PHYCINE are two-fold,
commonsense knowledge emerges with prediction, and physical concepts of
different abstract levels should be reasoned in a bottom-up fashion. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that variables inferred by our system work in
accordance with the properties of the corresponding physical concepts. We also
show that object representations containing the discovered physical concepts
variables could help achieve better performance in causal reasoning tasks,
i.e., ComPhy.

					<dc:description>  To address the problem of scarcity and high annotation costs of rotated image
table detection datasets, this paper proposes a method for building a rotated
image table detection dataset. Based on the ICDAR2019MTD modern table detection
dataset, we refer to the annotation format of the DOTA dataset to create the
TRR360D rotated table detection dataset. The training set contains 600 rotated
images and 977 annotated instances, and the test set contains 240 rotated
images and 499 annotated instances. The AP50(T&lt;90) evaluation metric is
defined, and this dataset is available for future researchers to study rotated
table detection algorithms and promote the development of table detection

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a simple yet effective approach that improves continual
test-time adaptation (TTA) in a memory-efficient manner. TTA may primarily be
conducted on edge devices with limited memory, so reducing memory is crucial
but has been overlooked in previous TTA studies. In addition, long-term
adaptation often leads to catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, which
hinders applying TTA in real-world deployments. Our approach consists of two
components to address these issues. First, we present lightweight meta networks
that can adapt the frozen original networks to the target domain. This novel
architecture minimizes memory consumption by decreasing the size of
intermediate activations required for backpropagation. Second, our novel
self-distilled regularization controls the output of the meta networks not to
deviate significantly from the output of the frozen original networks, thereby
preserving well-trained knowledge from the source domain. Without additional
memory, this regularization prevents error accumulation and catastrophic
forgetting, resulting in stable performance even in long-term test-time
adaptation. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective strategy outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for image classification
and semantic segmentation tasks. Notably, our proposed method with ResNet-50
and WideResNet-40 takes 86% and 80% less memory than the recent
state-of-the-art method, CoTTA.

					<dc:description>  Ancient Chinese word segmentation (WSG) and part-of-speech tagging (POS) are
important to study ancient Chinese, but the amount of ancient Chinese WSG and
POS tagging data is still rare. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation
method of ancient Chinese WSG and POS tagging data using distant supervision
over parallel corpus. However, there are still mislabeled and unlabeled ancient
Chinese words inevitably in distant supervision. To address this problem, we
take advantage of the memorization effects of deep neural networks and a small
amount of annotated data to get a model with much knowledge and a little noise,
and then we use this model to relabel the ancient Chinese sentences in parallel
corpus. Experiments show that the model trained over the relabeled data
outperforms the model trained over the data generated from distant supervision
and the annotated data. Our code is available at

Earth. We taking into account the spin-dependent structure functions to
describe the polarized neutrino-nucleon cross-section, and also on the neutrino
absorption while it crosses all of the Earth. We found that adding spin
information and simultaneously assuming polarization of Earth's outer core
impacts the probability of neutrino absorption in the energy range of 10 - 100
TeV and for upward neutrino direction. However, the magnitude of the effect is
small and should be comparable with the magnitude of the errors associated with
the IceCube neutrino data.

					<dc:description>  Normal pressure hydrocephalus~(NPH) is a brain disorder associated with
enlarged ventricles and multiple cognitive and motor symptoms. The degree of
ventricular enlargement can be measured using magnetic resonance images~(MRIs)
and characterized quantitatively using the Evan's ratio (ER). Automatic
computation of ER is desired to avoid the extra time and variations associated
with manual measurements on MRI. Because shunt surgery is often used to treat
NPH, it is necessary that this process be robust to image artifacts caused by
the shunt and related implants. In this paper, we propose a 3D
regions-of-interest aware (ROI-aware) network for segmenting the ventricles.
The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both pre-surgery MRIs and
post-surgery MRIs with artifacts. Based on our segmentation results, we also
describe an automated approach to compute ER from these results. Experimental
results on multiple datasets demonstrate the potential of the proposed method
to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and management of NPH.

					<dc:title>A Generalized Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem Using the Koopman

					<dc:description>  The sampling theorem plays a fundamental role for the recovery of
continuous-time signals from discrete-time samples in the field of signal
processing. The sampling theorem of non-band-limited signals has evolved into
one of the most challenging problems. In this work, a generalized sampling
theorem -- which builds on the Koopman operator -- is proved for signals in
generator-bounded space (Theorem 1). It naturally extends the Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem that, 1) for band-limited signals, the lower bounds of
sampling frequency given by these two theorems are exactly the same; 2) the
Koopman operator-based sampling theorem can also provide finite bound of
sampling frequency for certain types of non-band-limited signals, which can not
be addressed by Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. These types of
non-band-limited signals include but not limited to, for example, inverse
Laplace transform with limited imaginary interval of integration, and linear
combinations of complex exponential functions. Moreover, the Koopman
operator-based reconstruction algorithm is provided with theoretical result of
convergence. By this algorithm, the sampling theorem is effectively illustrated
on several signals related to sine, exponential and polynomial signals.

					<dc:description>  Artificial Intelligence and digital health have the potential to transform
global health. However, having access to representative data to test and
validate algorithms in realistic production environments is essential. We
introduce HealthSyn, an open-source synthetic data generator of user behavior
for testing reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of mobile health
interventions. The generator utilizes Markov processes to generate diverse user
actions, with individual user behavioral patterns that can change in reaction
to personalized interventions (i.e., reminders, recommendations, and
incentives). These actions are translated into actual logs using an ML-purposed
data schema specific to the mobile health application functionality included
with HealthKit, and open-source SDK. The logs can be fed to pipelines to obtain
user metrics. The generated data, which is based on real-world behaviors and
simulation techniques, can be used to develop, test, and evaluate, both ML
algorithms in research and end-to-end operational RL-based intervention
delivery frameworks.

					<dc:description>  The effect of a diffusivity edge is studied in a system of scalar active
matter confined by a periodic potential and driven by an externally applied
force. We find that this system shows qualitatively distinct stationary regimes
depending on the amplitude of the driving force with respect to the potential
barrier. For small driving, the diffusivity edge induces a transition to a
condensed phase analogous to the Bose-Einstein-like condensation reported for
the nondriven case, which is characterized by a density-independent steady
state current. Conversely, large external forces lead to a qualitatively
different phase diagram since in this case condensation is only possible beyond
a given density threshold, while the associated transition at higher densities
is found to be reentrant.

					<dc:description>  Artificial intelligence-based methods have generated substantial interest in
nuclear medicine. An area of significant interest has been using deep-learning
(DL)-based approaches for denoising images acquired with lower doses, shorter
acquisition times, or both. Objective evaluation of these approaches is
essential for clinical application. DL-based approaches for denoising
nuclear-medicine images have typically been evaluated using fidelity-based
figures of merit (FoMs) such as RMSE and SSIM. However, these images are
acquired for clinical tasks and thus should be evaluated based on their
performance in these tasks. Our objectives were to (1) investigate whether
evaluation with these FoMs is consistent with objective clinical-task-based
evaluation; (2) provide a theoretical analysis for determining the impact of
denoising on signal-detection tasks; (3) demonstrate the utility of virtual
clinical trials (VCTs) to evaluate DL-based methods. A VCT to evaluate a
DL-based method for denoising myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) images was
conducted. The impact of DL-based denoising was evaluated using fidelity-based
FoMs and AUC, which quantified performance on detecting perfusion defects in
MPS images as obtained using a model observer with anthropomorphic channels.
Based on fidelity-based FoMs, denoising using the considered DL-based method
led to significantly superior performance. However, based on ROC analysis,
denoising did not improve, and in fact, often degraded detection-task
performance. The results motivate the need for objective task-based evaluation
of DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VCTs provide a
mechanism to conduct such evaluations using VCTs. Finally, our theoretical
treatment reveals insights into the reasons for the limited performance of the
denoising approach.

					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Recently, it has been proposed that Hubble tension can be addressed in the
$\Lambda$CDM model if the lookback time approach is considered on the redshift
$z$ measured. From this interesting proposal, the lookback time evolution seems
to match the observational values of the current Hubble parameter $H_0$ at any
$z$. In this comment, we discuss that using a lookback time approach function
$H_{0}^{(z)}$, does not address the $H_0$ tension issue completely. It has been
studied that the growing tension among early-time and local measurements of
$H_0$ are possible concealed sources of systematic error in observations or
modifications (or extensions) to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore,
we show that the age of the Universe is sensitive to both $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$
in flat $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological models.

					<dc:description>  We give Hoeffding and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities for the
largest eigenvalue of sums of random matrices arising from a Markov chain. We
consider time-dependent matrix-valued functions on a general state space,
generalizing previous that had only considered Hoeffding-type inequalities, and
only for time-independent functions on a finite state space. In particular, we
study a kind of noncommutative moment generating function, give tight bounds on
it, and use a method of Garg et al. to turn this into tail bounds. Our proof
proceeds spectrally, bounding the norm of a certain perturbed operator. In the
process we make an interesting connection to dynamical systems and Banach space
theory to prove a crucial result on the limiting behavior of our moment
generating function that may be of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  Large language models (LLMs) have taken the scientific world by storm,
changing the landscape of natural language processing and human-computer
interaction. These powerful tools can answer complex questions and,
surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and
applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this
paper, we present a collaborative design framework that combines interactive
evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design
process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most
promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task --
the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts
with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language
model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process
by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects,
recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework
on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely.

					<dc:description>  Optimization time integrators have proven to be effective at solving complex
multi-physics problems, such as deformation of solids with non-linear material
models, contact with friction, strain limiting, etc. For challenging problems
with high accuracy requirements, Newton-type optimizers are often used. This
necessitates first- and second-order derivatives of the global non-linear
objective function. Manually differentiating, implementing and optimizing the
resulting code is extremely time-consuming, error-prone, and precludes quick
changes to the model.
  We present SymX, a framework based on symbolic expressions that computes the
first and second derivatives by symbolic differentiation, generates efficient
vectorized source code, compiles it on-the-fly, and performs the global
assembly of element contributions in parallel. The user only has to provide the
symbolic expression of an energy function for a single element in the
discretization and our system will determine the assembled derivatives for the
whole model. SymX is designed to be an integral part of a simulation system and
can easily be integrated into existing ones. We demonstrate the versatility of
our framework in various complex simulations showing different non-linear
materials, higher-order finite elements, rigid body systems, adaptive cloth,
frictional contact, and coupling multiple interacting physical systems.
Moreover, we compare our method with alternative approaches and show that SymX
is significantly faster than a current state-or-the-art framework (up to two
orders of magnitude for a higher-order FEM simulation).

					<dc:description>  A single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) measurement, called a
micrograph, consists of multiple two-dimensional tomographic projections of a
three-dimensional molecular structure at unknown locations, taken under unknown
viewing directions. All existing cryo-EM algorithmic pipelines first locate and
extract the projection images, and then reconstruct the structure from the
extracted images. However, if the molecular structure is small, the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data is very low, and thus accurate
detection of projection images within the micrograph is challenging.
Consequently, all standard techniques fail in low-SNR regimes. To recover
molecular structures from measurements of low SNR, and in particular small
molecular structures, we devise a stochastic approximate
expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the three-dimensional structure
directly from the micrograph, bypassing locating the projection images. We
corroborate our computational scheme with numerical experiments, and present
successful structure recoveries from simulated noisy measurements.

					<dc:description>  BioImageLoader (BIL) is a python library that handles bioimage datasets for
machine learning applications, easing simple workflows and enabling complex
ones. BIL attempts to wrap the numerous and varied bioimages datasets in
unified interfaces, to easily concatenate, perform image augmentation, and
batch-load them. By acting at a per experimental dataset level, it enables both
a high level of customization and a comparison across experiments. Here we
present the library and show some application it enables, including retraining
published deep learning architectures and evaluating their versatility in a
leave-one-dataset-out fashion.

					<dc:description>  We aim to understand how people assess human likeness in navigation produced
by people and artificially intelligent (AI) agents in a video game. To this
end, we propose a novel AI agent with the goal of generating more human-like
behavior. We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the
human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI
agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test,
while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human
judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an
AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like
navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments.
This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider
human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a
key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.

					<dc:description>  Jupiter's magnetosphere is considered to be the most powerful particle
accelerator in the Solar System, accelerating electrons from eV to 70 MeV and
ions to GeV energies. How electromagnetic processes drive energy and particle
flows, producing and removing energetic particles, is at the heart of
Heliophysics. Particularly, the 2013 Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space
Physics was to &quot;Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both
within the heliosphere and throughout the universe&quot;. The Jovian system offers
an ideal natural laboratory to investigate all of the universal processes
highlighted in the previous Decadal. The X-ray waveband has been widely used to
remotely study plasma across astrophysical systems. The majority of
astrophysical emissions can be grouped into 5 X-ray processes: fluorescence,
thermal/coronal, scattering, charge exchange and particle acceleration. The
Jovian system offers perhaps the only system that presents a rich catalog of
all of these X-ray emission processes and can also be visited in-situ,
affording the special possibility to directly link fundamental plasma processes
with their resulting X-ray signatures. This offers invaluable ground-truths for
astrophysical objects beyond the reach of in-situ exploration (e.g. brown
dwarfs, magnetars or galaxy clusters that map the cosmos). Here, we show how
coupling in-situ measurements with in-orbit X-ray observations of Jupiter's
radiation belts, Galilean satellites, Io Torus, and atmosphere addresses
fundamental heliophysics questions with wide-reaching impact across helio- and
astrophysics. New developments like miniaturized X-ray optics and
radiation-tolerant detectors, provide compact, lightweight, wide-field X-ray
instruments perfectly suited to the Jupiter system, enabling this exciting new
possibility.

					<dc:description>  T cells monitor the health status of cells by identifying foreign peptides
displayed on their surface. T-cell receptors (TCRs), which are protein
complexes found on the surface of T cells, are able to bind to these peptides.
This process is known as TCR recognition and constitutes a key step for immune
response. Optimizing TCR sequences for TCR recognition represents a fundamental
step towards the development of personalized treatments to trigger immune
responses killing cancerous or virus-infected cells. In this paper, we
formulated the search for these optimized TCRs as a reinforcement learning (RL)
problem, and presented a framework TCRPPO with a mutation policy using proximal
policy optimization. TCRPPO mutates TCRs into effective ones that can recognize
given peptides. TCRPPO leverages a reward function that combines the
likelihoods of mutated sequences being valid TCRs measured by a new scoring
function based on deep autoencoders, with the probabilities of mutated
sequences recognizing peptides from a peptide-TCR interaction predictor. We
compared TCRPPO with multiple baseline methods and demonstrated that TCRPPO
significantly outperforms all the baseline methods to generate positive binding
and valid TCRs. These results demonstrate the potential of TCRPPO for both
precision immunotherapy and peptide-recognizing TCR motif discovery.

					<dc:description>  Weighted poset block metric is a generalization of weighted poset metric
introduced by Panek et al. ([\ref{panek}]) and the metric for linear
error-block codes introduced by Feng et al. ([\ref{FENG}]). This type of
metrics includes many classical metrics such as Hamming metric, Lee metric,
poset metric, pomset metric, poset block metric, pomset block metric and so on.
In this work, we focus on constructing new codes under weighted poset block
metric from given ones. Some basic properties such as minimum distance and
covering radius are determined.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, methods for Bayesian inference have been widely used in many
different problems in physics where detection and characterization are
necessary. Data analysis in gravitational-wave astronomy is a prime example of
such a case. Bayesian inference has been very successful because this technique
provides a representation of the parameters as a posterior probability
distribution, with uncertainties informed by the precision of the experimental
measurements. During the last couple of decades, many specific advances have
been proposed and employed in order to solve a large variety of different
problems. In this work, we present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
that integrates many of those concepts into a single MCMC package. For this
purpose, we have built {\tt Eryn}, a user-friendly and multipurpose toolbox for
Bayesian inference, which can be utilized for solving parameter estimation and
model selection problems, ranging from simple inference questions, to those
with large-scale model variation requiring trans-dimensional MCMC methods, like
the LISA global fit problem. In this paper, we describe this sampler package
and illustrate its capabilities on a variety of use cases.

					<dc:description>  The rapid advances in Vision Transformer (ViT) refresh the state-of-the-art
performances in various vision tasks, overshadowing the conventional CNN-based
models. This ignites a few recent striking-back research in the CNN world
showing that pure CNN models can achieve as good performance as ViT models when
carefully tuned. While encouraging, designing such high-performance CNN models
is challenging, requiring non-trivial prior knowledge of network design. To
this end, a novel framework termed Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep
CNN (DeepMAD) is proposed to design high-performance CNN models in a principled
way. In DeepMAD, a CNN network is modeled as an information processing system
whose expressiveness and effectiveness can be analytically formulated by their
structural parameters. Then a constrained mathematical programming (MP) problem
is proposed to optimize these structural parameters. The MP problem can be
easily solved by off-the-shelf MP solvers on CPUs with a small memory
footprint. In addition, DeepMAD is a pure mathematical framework: no GPU or
training data is required during network design. The superiority of DeepMAD is
validated on multiple large-scale computer vision benchmark datasets. Notably
on ImageNet-1k, only using conventional convolutional layers, DeepMAD achieves
0.7% and 1.5% higher top-1 accuracy than ConvNeXt and Swin on Tiny level, and
0.8% and 0.9% higher on Small level.

					<dc:description>  This vision paper proposes KGNet, an on-demand graph machine learning (GML)
as a service on top of RDF engines to support GML-enabled SPARQL queries. KGNet
automates the training of GML models on a KG by identifying a task-specific
subgraph. This helps reduce the task-irrelevant KG structure and properties for
better scalability and accuracy. While training a GML model on KG, KGNet
collects metadata of trained models in the form of an RDF graph called KGMeta,
which is interlinked with the relevant subgraphs in KG. Finally, all trained
models are accessible via a SPARQL-like query. We call it a GML-enabled query
and refer to it as SPARQLML. KGNet supports SPARQLML on top of existing RDF
engines as an interface for querying and inferencing over KGs using GML models.
The development of KGNet poses research opportunities in several areas,
including meta-sampling for identifying task-specific subgraphs, GML pipeline
automation with computational constraints, such as limited time and memory
budget, and SPARQLML query optimization. KGNet supports different GML tasks,
such as node classification, link prediction, and semantic entity matching. We
evaluated KGNet using two real KGs of different application domains. Compared
to training on the entire KG, KGNet significantly reduced training time and
memory usage while maintaining comparable or improved accuracy. The KGNet
source-code is available for further study

					<dc:description>  Protoplanetary disks around Herbig AeBe stars are exciting targets for
studying the chemical environments where giant planets form. Save for a few
disks, however, much of Herbig AeBe disk chemistry is an open frontier. We
present a Submillimeter Array (SMA) $\sim$213-268 GHz pilot survey of mm
continuum, CO isotopologues, and other small molecules in disks around five
Herbig AeBe stars (HD 34282, HD 36112, HD 38120, HD 142666, and HD 144432). We
detect or tentatively detect $^{12}$CO 2--1 and $^{13}$CO 2--1 from four disks;
C$^{18}$O 2--1 and HCO$^+$ 3--2 from three disks; HCN 3--2, CS 5--4, and
DCO$^+$ 3--2 from two disks; and C$_2$H 3--2 and DCN 3--2 from one disk each.
H$_2$CO 3--2 is undetected at the sensitivity of our observations. The mm
continuum images of HD 34282 suggest a faint, unresolved source $\sim$5\farcs0
away, which could arise from a distant orbital companion or an extended spiral
arm. We fold our sample into a compilation of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe/F disks
from the literature. Altogether, most line fluxes generally increase with mm
continuum flux. Line flux ratios between CO 2--1 isotopologues are nearest to
unity for the Herbig AeBe/F disks. This may indicate emitting layers with
relatively similar, warmer temperatures and more abundant CO relative to disk
dust mass. Lower HCO$^+$ 3--2 flux ratios may reflect less ionization in Herbig
AeBe/F disks. Smaller detection rates and flux ratios for DCO$^+$ 3--2, DCN
3--2, and H$_2$CO 3--2 suggest smaller regimes of cold chemistry around the
luminous Herbig AeBe/F stars.

					<dc:description>  We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of a simple yet generic
multifield inflation model characterized by two scalar fields coupled to each
other and nonminimally coupled to gravity, fit to Planck 2018 cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data. In particular, model parameters are constrained by data
on the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature
perturbations on CMB scales $A_s$, the spectral index $n_s$, and the ratio of
power in tensor to scalar modes $r$, with a prior that the primordial power
spectrum should also lead to primordial black hole (PBH) production sufficient
to account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance. We find that $n_s$ in
particular controls the constraints on our model. Whereas previous studies of
PBH formation from an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation have highlighted the
need for at least one model parameter to be highly fine-tuned, we identify a
degeneracy direction in parameter space such that shifts by $\sim 10\%$ of one
parameter can be compensated by comparable shifts in other parameters while
preserving a close fit between model predictions and observations. Furthermore,
we find this allowed parameter region produces observable gravitational wave
(GW) signals in the frequency ranges to which upcoming experiments are
projected to be sensitive, including Advanced LIGO and Virgo, the Einstein
Telescope (ET), DECIGO, and LISA.

					<dc:description>  These lecture notes on the particle physics and astrophysics of dark matter
(DM) were delivered at TASI 2022 ``Ten Years After the Higgs Discovery:
Particle Physics Now and Future.&quot; The focus of these lecture notes, aimed at
the level of advanced graduate students and beginning postdocs, is on indirect
(i.e., astrophysical and cosmological) probes of particle DM models. While DM
models and indirect detection are broadly discussed, the examples of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions are worked out in detail. The
topics covered include: the role of DM in the cosmology and astrophysics of
structure formation, including DM density profiles in galaxies, general
constraints on particle DM models, the theory of minimal DM, with the higgsino
as a relevant and illustrative example, indirect detection with gamma-rays,
including with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array, axions as a solution to
the strong-CP problem and a DM candidate, including discussions of possible
ultraviolet completions and of axion string cosmology, and astrophysical probes
of axions such as with isocurvature perturbations, $N_{\rm eff}$, black hole
superradiance, radio telescopes, spectral modulations, stellar polarization,
and stellar cooling, amongst other topics. Example Jupyter notebooks are
provided that walk the reader through relevant analyses, including an example
statistical analysis of a DM annihilation search towards the Segue I dwarf
galaxy with gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope that is relevant
for DM explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center Excess. We also provide an
introduction to frequentist statistics for particle and astro-particle physics.
These lecture notes are meant to be pedagogical, with the focus on explaining
the underlying physical principles and analysis techniques that are set to play
crucial roles in the search for particle DM in the coming decade.

					<dc:description>  Advances in quantum engineering have enabled the design, measurement, and
precise control of synthetic condensed matter systems. The platform of
superconducting circuits offers two particular capabilities: flexible
connectivity of circuit elements that enables a variety of lattice geometries,
and circuit nonlinearity that provides access to strongly interacting physics.
Separately, these features have allowed for the creation of curved-space
lattices and the realization of strongly correlated phases and dynamics in
one-dimensional chains and square lattices. Missing in this suite of
simulations is the simultaneous integration of interacting particles into
lattices with unique band dispersions, such as dispersionless flat bands. An
ideal building block for flat-band physics is the Aharonov-Bohm cage: a single
plaquette of a lattice whose band structure consists entirely of flat bands.
Here, we experimentally construct an Aharonov-Bohm cage and observe the
localization of a single photon, the hallmark of all-bands-flat physics. Upon
placing an interaction-bound photon pair into the cage, we see a delocalized
walk indicating an escape from Aharonov-Bohm caging. We further find that a
variation of caging persists for two particles initialized on opposite sites of
the cage. These results mark the first experimental work where interacting
particles circumvent an Aharonov-Bohm cage and establish superconducting
circuits for studies of flat-band-lattice dynamics with strong interactions.

					<dc:description>  The presence of nearby conformal field theories (CFTs) hidden in the complex
plane of the tuning parameter was recently proposed as an elegant explanation
for the ubiquity of &quot;weakly first-order&quot; transitions in condensed matter and
high-energy systems. In this work, we perform an exact microscopic study of
such a complex CFT (CCFT) in the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model. The
well-known absence of symmetry-breaking of the $O(n&gt;2)$ model is understood as
arising from the displacement of the non-trivial fixed points into the complex
temperature plane. Thanks to a numerical finite-size study of the transfer
matrix, we confirm the presence of a CCFT in the complex plane and extract the
real and imaginary parts of the central charge and scaling dimensions. By
comparing those with the analytic continuation of predictions from Coulomb gas
techniques, we determine the range of validity of the analytic continuation to
extend up to $n_g \approx 12.34$, beyond which the CCFT gives way to a gapped
state. Finally, we propose a beta function which reproduces the main features
of the phase diagram and which suggests an interpretation of the CCFT as a
liquid-gas critical point at the end of a first-order transition line.

					<dc:description>  Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are predicted to be embedded in the disks of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to gravitational drag and in-situ star
formation. However, clear evidence for AGN disk-embedded BHs is currently
lacking. Here, as possible electromagnetic signatures of these BHs, we
investigate breakout emission from shocks emerging around Blandford-Znajek jets
launched from accreting BHs in AGN disks. We assume that the majority of the
highly super-Eddington flow reaches the BH, produces a strong jet, and the jet
produces feedback that shuts off accretion and thus leads to episodic flaring.
While these assumptions are highly uncertain at present, they predict a
breakout emission characterized by luminous thermal emission in the X-ray
bands, and bright, broadband non-thermal emission from the infrared to the
gamma-ray bands. The flare duration depends on the BH's distance $r$ from the
central supermassive BH, varying between $10^3-10^6$ s for $r \sim 0.01-1$ pc.
This emission can be discovered by current and future infrared, optical, and
X-ray wide-field surveys and monitoring campaigns of nearby AGNs.

					<dc:description>  Twisting bilayer sheets of graphene have been proven to be an efficient way
to manipulate the electronic Dirac-like properties, resulting in flat bands at
magic angles. Inspired by the electronic model, we develop a continuum model
for the lattice dynamics of twisted bilayer graphene and we show that a
remarkable band flattening applies to almost all the high-frequency in-plane
lattice vibration modes, including the valley Dirac phonon, valley optical
phonon, and zone-center optical phonon bands. Utilizing an approximate
approach, we estimate small but finite magic angles at which a vanishing phonon
bandwidth is expected. In contrast to the electronic case, the existence of a
restoring potential prohibits the emergence of a magic angle in a more accurate
modeling. The predicted phonon band-flattening is highly tunable by the twist
angle and this strong dependence is directly accessible by spectroscopic tools.

					<dc:description>  We use a recent lattice determination of the vector and axial $D_s \to
\gamma$ form factors at high squared momentum transfer $q^2$ to infer their
$B_s \to \gamma$ counterparts. To this end, we introduce a phenomenological
approach summarized as follows. First, we describe the lattice data with
different fit templates motivated by vector-meson dominance, that is expected
to hold in the high-$q^2$ region considered. We identify reference fit ansaetze
with one or two physical poles, that we validate against alternative templates.
Then, the pole residues can be unambiguously related to the appropriate
couplings involving the pseudoscalar, the vector mesons concerned, and the
photon -- or tri-couplings -- and the latter can be expressed as sums over
quark magnetic moments, weighed by their e.m. charges. This description obeys a
well-defined heavy-quark scaling, that allows to parametrically scale up the
form factors to the $B_s \to \gamma$ case. We discuss a number of cross-checks
of the whole approach, whose validation rests ultimately in a first-principle
determination, e.g. in lattice QCD. Finally, we use our obtained form factors
to reassess the SM prediction of $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^- \gamma)$ in
the range $\sqrt{q^2} \in [4.2, 5.0]$ GeV, where an experimental measurement is
awaited.

					<dc:description>  The equation of state of neutron-star cores can be constrained by requiring a
consistent connection to the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
calculations at high densities. The constraining power of the QCD input depends
on uncertainties from missing higher-order terms, the choice of the unphysical
renormalization scale, and the reference density where QCD calculations are
performed. Within a Bayesian approach, we discuss the convergence of the
perturbative QCD series, quantify its uncertainties at high densities, and
present a framework to systematically propagate the uncertainties down to
neutron-star densities. We find that the effect of the QCD input on the
neutron-star inference is insensitive to the various unphysical choices made in
the uncertainty estimation.

					<dc:description>  Optical driving of materials has emerged as a promising tool to control their
macroscopic properties. In this work we present a microscopic mechanism for
efficiently photo-inducing superconductivity. We investigate an attractive
electron-electron interaction mediated by a boson that couples to an electronic
transition between two bands separated by a band gap. While this attraction is
small in equilibrium, we find that it can be increased by several orders of
magnitude when the bosons are driven into a nonthermal state. Moreover, not
only is the induced attraction enhanced when the bosons are driven, but this
enhancement is further amplified when the boson is near-resonant to the
electronic interband excitation energy, making this mechanism a potentially
ideal candidate for efficient photo-induced superconductivity. We first use
exact diagonalisation calculations of a two-site model to prove that pairing is
indeed resonantly enhanced out-of equilibrium. We then investigate the
potential of this mechanism to increase the superconducting transition
temperature, and find by investigating the gap equation that pairing is
resonantly amplified when the bosons are in a nonthermal state. We argue that
our proposed mechanism provides a simple prescription for designing new
platforms that enable photo-induced superconductivity at significant
temperatures and moderate driving strengths, and estimate a transition
temperature $T_{\rm c} \approx 5\rm{K}$ for a $\rm SrTiO_3$ -- graphene
heterostructure.

					<dc:description>  Modern interferometers routinely provide radio-astronomical images down to
subarcsecond resolution. However, interferometers filter out spatial scales
larger than those sampled by the shortest baselines, which affects the
measurement of both spatial and spectral features. Complementary single-dish
data are vital for recovering the true flux distribution of spatially resolved
astronomical sources with such extended emission. In this work, we provide an
overview of the prominent available methods to combine single-dish and
interferometric observations. We test each of these methods in the framework of
the CASA data analysis software package on both synthetic continuum and
observed spectral data sets. We develop a set of new assessment tools that are
generally applicable to all radio-astronomical cases of data combination.
Applying these new assessment diagnostics, we evaluate the methods' performance
and demonstrate the significant improvement of the combined results in
comparison to purely interferometric reductions. We provide combination and
assessment scripts as add-on material. Our results highlight the advantage of
using data combination to ensure high-quality science images of spatially
resolved objects.

					<dc:description>  We study the spectrum of scalar charged operators in Conformal Field Theories
(CFTs) with a $U(1)$ global symmetry. The charged operators are dual, by the
state-operator correspondence, to homogenous charged states on the sphere. Such
states can break the $U(1)$ symmetry, and we define what we call the large $f$
regime in the CFT as one where the symmetry breaking scale is much higher than
the scale of the CFT sphere. In such a regime, there is (an approximate)
Goldstone boson associated to the breaking. We show that consistency of the
Goldstone boson physics implies that the spectrum of states, and therefore of
operators, must be convex in charge. More precisely, we show that any family of
operators of different charges, which are lowest dimension of their charge, and
which additionally share the same realisation of the Goldstone boson in terms
of the degrees of freedom of the CFT, must be convex.

					<dc:description>  Programmable quantum simulators such as superconducting quantum processors
and ultracold atomic lattices represent rapidly developing emergent technology
that may one day qualitatively outperform existing classical computers. Yet,
apart from a few breakthroughs, the range of viable computational applications
with current-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is still
significantly limited by gate errors, quantum decoherence and the number of
high quality qubits. In this work, we develop an approach that places NISQ
hardware as particularly suitable platforms for simulating multi-dimensional
condensed matter systems, including lattices beyond three dimensions which are
difficult to realize or probe in other settings. By fully exploiting the
exponentially large Hilbert space of a quantum chain, we encoded a
high-dimensional model in terms of non-local many-body interactions that can
further be systematically transcribed into quantum gates. We demonstrate the
power of our approach by realizing, on IBM transmon-based quantum computers,
higher-order topological states in up to four dimensions, which are exotic
phases that have never been realized in any quantum setting. With the aid of
in-house circuit compression and error mitigation techniques, we measured the
topological state dynamics and their protected midgap spectra to a high degree
of accuracy, as benchmarked by reference exact diagonalization data. The time
and memory needed with our approach scales favorably with system size and
dimensionality compared to exact diagonalization on classical computers.

					<dc:description>  The past few years have seen a revived interest in quantum geometrical
characterizations of band structures due to the rapid development of
topological insulators and semi-metals. Although the metric tensor has been
connected to many geometrical concepts for single bands, the exploration of
these concepts to a multi-band paradigm still promises a new field of interest.
Formally, multi-band systems, featuring in particular degeneracies, have been
related to projective spaces, explaining also the success of relating quantum
geometrical aspects of flat band systems, albeit usually in the single band
picture. Here, we propose a different route involving Pl\&quot;ucker embeddings to
represent arbitrary classifying spaces, being the essential objects that encode
$all$ the relevant topology.This paradigm allows for the quantification of
geometrical quantities directly in readily manageable vector spaces that a
priori do not involve projectors or the need of flat band conditions. As a
result, our findings are shown to pave the way for identifying new geometrical
objects and defining metrics in arbitrary multi-band systems, especially beyond
the single flatband limit, promising a versatile tool that can be applied in
contexts that range from response theories to finding quantum volumes and
bounds on superfluid densities as well as possible quantum computations.

					<dc:description>  Localization marks the breakdown of thermalization in subregions of quantum
many-body systems in the presence of sufficiently large disorder. In this
paper, we use numerical techniques to study thermalization and localization in
a many-body system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators obtained by
discretizing a scalar quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime. We consider
a Gaussian initial state, constructed through a global mass quench, with a
quadratic Hamiltonian, and solve for the system's exact dynamics without and
with disorder in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that finite-size
systems localize for sufficiently large disorder in both cases, such that the
entanglement entropy of subregions retains its initial area-law behavior, and
the system no longer develops long-range correlations. To probe the
thermalization-to-localization transition further, we define a frequency gap
ratio that measures adjacent gaps in the phase space eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian and study how it varies with disorder strength and system size. We
find signatures of a chaotic regime at intermediate disorder in two spatial
dimensions and argue that it is a finite-size effect, such that the system
would localize for arbitrarily small disorder in the continuum in both one and
two spatial dimensions, consistent with Anderson localization. Lastly, we use
the frequency gap ratio to argue that in three spatial dimensions, on the other
hand, the system would only localize for disorder strengths above a critical
value in the continuum, again consistent with Anderson localization.

					<dc:description>  Existing reinforcement learning environment libraries use monolithic
environment classes, provide shallow methods for altering agent observation and
action spaces, and/or are tied to a specific simulation environment. The Core
Reinforcement Learning library (CoRL) is a modular, composable, and
hyper-configurable environment creation tool. It allows minute control over
agent observations, rewards, and done conditions through the use of
easy-to-read configuration files, pydantic validators, and a functor design
pattern. Using integration pathways allows agents to be quickly implemented in
new simulation environments, encourages rapid exploration, and enables
transition of knowledge from low-fidelity to high-fidelity simulations.
Natively multi-agent design and integration with Ray/RLLib (Liang et al., 2018)
at release allow for easy scalability of agent complexity and computing power.

Additionally, radial extension of `analytically-described' disc zones is not
evident in many cases. We calculate vertical structure of accretion discs
around compact objects, with and without external irradiation, with radiative
and convective energy transport taken into account. For this, we introduce a
new open Python code, allowing different equations of state (EoS) and opacity
laws, including tabular values. As a result, radial structure and stability
`S-curves' are calculated for specific disc parameters and chemical
composition. In particular, based on more accurate power-law approximations for
opacity in the disc, we supply new analytic formulas for the farthest regions
of the hot disc around stellar-mass object. On calculating vertical structure
of a self-irradiated disc, we calculate a self-consistent value of the
irradiation parameter $C_{\rm irr}$ for stationary $\alpha$-disc. We find that,
for a fixed shape of the X-ray spectrum, $C_{\rm irr}$ depends weakly on the
accretion rate but changes with radius, and the dependence is driven by the
conditions in the photosphere and disc opening angle. The hot zone extent
depends on the ratio between irradiating and intrinsic flux: corresponding
relation for $T_{\rm irr,\, crit}$ is obtained.

represented as such. The method allows the development of Lyapunov functions
that are not necessarily symmetric about the origin, unlike the polynomial,
homogeneous Lyapunov functions discussed in the prior literature. The work is

					<dc:description>  Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large
number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential remains largely
unlocked since most work so far requires strict assumptions which do not hold
true in practice. To address this challenge and make progress in solving
real-world problems, we propose a new way of thinking about causality - we call
this causal deep learning. The framework which we propose for causal deep
learning spans three dimensions: (1) a structural dimension, which allows
incomplete causal knowledge rather than assuming either full or no causal
knowledge; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms which
are typically ignored; and finally, (3) a temporal dimension, which explicitly
allows for situations which capture exposure times or temporal structure.
Together, these dimensions allow us to make progress on a variety of real-world
problems by leveraging (sometimes incomplete) causal knowledge and/or combining
diverse causal deep learning methods. This new framework also enables
researchers to compare systematically across existing works as well as identify
promising research areas which can lead to real-world impact.

					<dc:description>  We study a 2D measurement-only random circuit motivated by the Bacon-Shor
error correcting code. We find a rich phase diagram as one varies the relative
probabilities of measuring nearest neighbor Pauli XX and ZZ check operators. In
the Bacon-Shor code, these checks commute with a group of stabilizer and
logical operators, which therefore represent conserved quantities. Described as
a subsystem symmetry, these conservation laws lead to a continuous phase
transition between an X-basis and Z-basis spin glass order. The two phases are
separated by a critical point where the entanglement entropy between two halves
of an L X L system scales as L ln L, a logarithmic violation of the area law.
We generalize to a model where the check operators break the subsystem
symmetries (and the Bacon-Shor code structure). In tension with established
heuristics, we find that the phase transition is replaced by a smooth
crossover, and the X- and Z-basis spin glass orders spatially coexist.
Additionally, if we approach the line of subsystem symmetries away from the
critical point in the phase diagram, some spin glass order parameters jump
discontinuously

					<dc:description>  Planetary obliquity and eccentricity influence climate by shaping the spatial
and temporal patterns of stellar energy incident at a planet's surface,
affecting both the annual mean climate and magnitude of seasonal variability.
Previous work has demonstrated the importance of both planetary obliquity and
eccentricity for climate and habitability, but most studies have not explicitly
modeled the response of life to these parameters. While exaggerated seasons may
be stressful to some types of life, a recent study found an increase in marine
biological activity for moderately high obliquities &lt;45$^{\circ}$ assuming an
Earth-like eccentricity. However, it is unclear how life might respond to
obliquities &gt;45$^{\circ}$, eccentricities much larger than Earth's, or the
combination of both. To address this gap, we use cGENIE-PlaSim, a 3-D marine
biogeochemical model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model, to
investigate the response of Earth-like marine life to a large range of
obliquities (0-90$^{\circ}$) and eccentricities (0-0.4). We find that marine
biological activity increases with both increasing obliquity and eccentricity
across the parameter space we considered, including the combination of high
obliquity and high eccentricity. We discuss these results in the context of
remote biosignatures, and we argue that planets with high obliquity and/or
eccentricity may be superhabitable worlds that are particularly favorable for
exoplanet life detection.

					<dc:description>  Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with high dimensionality are commonly
encountered in computational physics and engineering. However, finding
solutions for these PDEs can be computationally expensive, making model-order
reduction crucial. We propose such a data-driven scheme that automates the
identification of the time-scales involved and can produce stable predictions
forward in time as well as under different initial conditions not included in
the training data. To this end, we combine a non-linear autoencoder
architecture with a time-continuous model for the latent dynamics in the
complex space. It readily allows for the inclusion of sparse and irregularly
sampled training data. The learned, latent dynamics are interpretable and
reveal the different temporal scales involved. We show that this data-driven
scheme can automatically learn the independent processes that decompose a
system of linear ODEs along the eigenvectors of the system's matrix. Apart from
this, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in a hidden
Markov Model and the (discretized) Kuramoto-Shivashinsky (KS) equation.
Additionally, we propose a probabilistic version, which captures predictive
uncertainties and further improves upon the results of the deterministic
framework.

					<dc:description>  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial part of mobile robotics and
autonomous driving as well as other computer vision tasks. It refers to the
process of identifying a place depicted in a query image using only computer
vision. At large scale, repetitive structures, weather and illumination changes
pose a real challenge, as appearances can drastically change over time. Along
with tackling these challenges, an efficient VPR technique must also be
practical in real-world scenarios where latency matters. To address this, we
introduce MixVPR, a new holistic feature aggregation technique that takes
feature maps from pre-trained backbones as a set of global features. Then, it
incorporates a global relationship between elements in each feature map in a
cascade of feature mixing, eliminating the need for local or pyramidal
aggregation as done in NetVLAD or TransVPR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our technique through extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks.
Our method outperforms all existing techniques by a large margin while having
less than half the number of parameters compared to CosPlace and NetVLAD. We
achieve a new all-time high recall@1 score of 94.6% on Pitts250k-test, 88.0% on
MapillarySLS, and more importantly, 58.4% on Nordland. Finally, our method
outperforms two-stage retrieval techniques such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and
SuperGLUE all while being orders of magnitude faster. Our code and trained
models are available at https://github.com/amaralibey/MixVPR.

computational overheads. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-structured
pruning framework called R-TOSS that overcomes the shortcomings of
state-of-the-art model pruning techniques. Experimental results on the
JetsonTX2 show that R-TOSS has a compression rate of 4.4x on the YOLOv5 object
detector with a 2.15x speedup in inference time and 57.01% decrease in energy
usage. R-TOSS also enables 2.89x compression on RetinaNet with a 1.86x speedup
in inference time and 56.31% decrease in energy usage. We also demonstrate
significant improvements compared to various state-of-the-art pruning
techniques.

					<dc:description>  Galaxy and occupies perhaps a quarter of the volume of the Galactic disk.
Decoding the spectrum of the Galactic diffuse ionizing field is of fundamental
interest. This can be done via direct measurements of ionization fractions of
various elements. Based on current physical models for the WIM we predicted
that mid-IR fine structure lines of Ne, Ar and S would be within the grasp of
the Mid-Infrared Imager-Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS), an Integral
Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph, aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Motivated thus we analyzed a pair of commissioning data sets and detected
[NeII] 12.81 $\mu$m, [SIII] 18.71 $\mu$m and possibly [SIV] 10.51 $\mu$m. The
inferred emission measure for these detections is about 10 ${\rm cm^{-6} pc}$,
typical of the WIM. These detections are broadly consistent with expectations
of physical models for the WIM. The current detections are limited by
uncorrected fringing (and to a lesser extent by baseline variations). In due
course, we expect, as with other IFUs, the calibration pipeline to deliver
photon-noise-limited spectra. The detections reported here bode well for the
study of the WIM. Along most lines-of-sight hour-long MIRI-MRS observations
should detect line emission from the WIM. When combined with optical
observations by modern IFUs with high spectral resolution on large ground-based
telescopes, the ionization fraction and temperature of neon and sulfur can be
robustly inferred. Separately, the ionization of helium in the WIM can be
probed by NIRspec. Finally, joint JWST and optical IFU studies will open up a
new cottage industry of studying the WIM on arcsecond scales.

					<dc:description>  The astrophysical consequences of the presence of a quintessence scalar field
on the evolution of the horizon and on the accretion disk surrounding a static
black hole, in the Scalar-Vector-Tensor version of Modified Gravity (MOG), are
investigated. The positions of the stable circular orbits of the massive test
particles, moving around the central object, are obtained from the extremum of
the effective potential. Detailed calculations are also presented to
investigate the light deflection, shadow and Shapiro effect for such a black
hole. The electromagnetic properties of the accretion disks that form around
such black holes are considered in detail. The energy flux and efficiency
parameter are estimated analytically and numerically. A comparison with the
disk properties in Schwarzschild geometry is also performed. The quantum
properties of the black hole are also considered, and the Hawking temperature
and the mass loss rate due to the Hawking radiation are considered. The
obtained results may lead to the possibility of direct astrophysical tests of
black hole type objects in modified gravity theories.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the spread of a classical SIR process on a two-layer
random network, where the first layer represents the households, while the
second layer models the contacts outside the households by a random scale-free
graph. We build a three-parameter graph, called polynomial model, where the new
vertices are connected to the existing ones either uniformly, or
preferentially, or by forming random triangles. We examine the effect of the
graph's properties on the goodness of the estimation of the infection rate
$\tau$. In the classical approach, to estimate $\tau$ one needs to approximate
the number of SI edges between households, since the graph itself is supposed
to be unobservable. Our simulation study reveals that the estimation is poorer
at the beginning of the epidemic, for larger preferential attachment parameter
of the graph, and for larger $\tau$. We can improve the estimate either by (i)
adjusting it by a graph-dependent factor at a fixed time in the earlier phase
of the epidemic, or (ii) by applying a shift in the estimation of the SI edges.
Furthermore, we establish our method to be robust to changes in average
clustering of the graph model. We also extend a graph neural network (GNN)
approach for estimating contagion dynamics for our two-layered graphs. We find
that dense networks offer better training datasets. Moreover, GNN perfomance is
measured better using the $l_2$ loss function rather than cross-entropy.

					<dc:description>  We measured the nuclear--recoil ionization yield in silicon with a cryogenic
phonon-sensitive gram-scale detector. Neutrons from a mono-energetic beam
scatter off of the silicon nuclei at angles corresponding to energy depositions
from 4\,keV down to 100\,eV, the lowest energy probed so far. The results show
no sign of an ionization production threshold above 100\,eV. These results call
for further investigation of the ionization yield theory and a comprehensive
determination of the detector response function at energies below the keV
scale.

					<dc:description>  The tight coupling between communication and control in cyber-physical
systems is necessary to enable the complex regulation required to operate these
systems. Unfortunately, cyberattackers can exploit network vulnerabilities to
compromise communication and force unsafe decision-making and dynamics. If a
cyberattack is not detected and isolated in a timely manner, the control
process must balance adhering to the received measurement signals to maintain
system operation and ensuring that temporary compromise of the signals does not
force unsafe dynamics. For this purpose, we present and employ a safety
critical controller based on control barrier functions to mitigate attacks
against load frequency control in smart power grids. We validate the paper's
findings using simulation on a high-fidelity testbed.

					<dc:title>Exploring Data Augmentation Methods on Social Media Corpora</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Pietri, Isabel Garcia</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Data augmentation has proven widely effective in computer vision. In Natural
Language Processing (NLP) data augmentation remains an area of active research.
There is no widely accepted augmentation technique that works well across tasks
and model architectures. In this paper we explore data augmentation techniques
in the context of text classification using two social media datasets. We
explore popular varieties of data augmentation, starting with oversampling,
Easy Data Augmentation (Wei and Zou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrich et
al., 2015). We also consider Greyscaling, a relatively unexplored data
augmentation technique that seeks to mitigate the intensity of adjectives in
examples. Finally, we consider a few-shot learning approach: Pattern-Exploiting
Training (PET) (Schick et al., 2020). For the experiments we use a BERT
transformer architecture. Results show that augmentation techniques provide
only minimal and inconsistent improvements. Synonym replacement provided
evidence of some performance improvement and adjective scales with Grayscaling
is an area where further exploration would be valuable. Few-shot learning
experiments show consistent improvement over supervised training, and seem very
promising when classes are easily separable but further exploration would be
valuable.

					<dc:description>  We examine the low-energy spectrum and polarisation of the dipole moments of
two static polar molecules under the influence of an external dc electric field
and their anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. We model the molecules as
quantum rigid rotors to take their rotational degrees of freedom into account,
and consider a selection of linear, symmetric and asymmetric top molecules. We
provide a comprehensive examination of the energy spectra and polarisation of
the dipoles for varying inter-molecular separation and direction of the
electric field, and find that the properties of the molecules depend strongly
on the field's direction at short separations, showing the importance of
accounting for molecular rotation. Our results provide important insight into
applications of cold molecules for quantum computation and molecular dipolar
gases.

candidates 4FGL J0935.3+0901, 4FGL J1627.7+3219, and 4FGL J2212.4+0708 using
the Green Bank Telescope in an attempt to detect the proposed radio counterpart
of the multi-wavelength variability seen in each system. We observed using the
VEGAS spectrometer, centered predominantly at 2165 MHz; however, we were also
granted observations at 820 MHz for 4FGL J1627.7+3219. We performed
acceleration searches on each dataset using PRESTO as well as additional jerk
searches of select observations. We see no evidence of a radio counterpart in
any of the observations for each of the three systems at this time. Additional
observations, perhaps at different orbital phases (e.g., inferior conjunction),
may yield detections of an MSP in the future. Therefore, we urge continued
monitoring of these systems to fully characterize the radio nature, however
faint or variable, of each system.

					<dc:description>  Dynamic prediction of causal effects under different treatment regimes
conditional on an individual's characteristics and longitudinal history is an
essential problem in precision medicine. This is challenging in practice
because outcomes and treatment assignment mechanisms are unknown in
observational studies, an individual's treatment efficacy is a counterfactual,
and the existence of selection bias is often unavoidable.
  We propose a Bayesian framework for identifying subgroup counterfactual
benefits of dynamic treatment regimes by adapting Bayesian g-computation
algorithm (J. Robins, 1986; Zhou, Elliott, &amp; Little, 2019) to incorporate
multivariate generalized linear mixed-effects models. Unmeasured time-invariant
factors are identified as subject-specific random effects in the assumed joint
distribution of outcomes, time-varying confounders, and treatment assignments.
Existing methods mostly assume no unmeasured confounding and focus on balancing
the observed confounder distributions between different treatments, while our
method allows the presence of time-invariant unmeasured confounding. We propose
a sequential ignorability assumption based on treatment assignment
heterogeneity, which is analogous to balancing the latent tendency toward each
treatment due to unmeasured time-invariant factors beyond the observables. We
use simulation studies to assess the sensitivity of the proposed method's
performance to various model assumptions. The method is applied to
observational clinical data to investigate the efficacy of continuously using
mycophenolate in different subgroups of scleroderma patients who were treated
with the drug.

					<dc:title>Using a DSL to read ROOT TTrees faster in Uproot</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Roy, Aryan</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Pivarski, Jim</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Experiment</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Uproot reads ROOT TTrees using pure Python. For numerical and (singly) jagged
arrays, this is fast because a whole block of data can be interpreted as an
array without modifying the data. For other cases, such as arrays of
std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;, numerical data are interleaved with structure,
and the only way to deserialize them is with a sequential algorithm. When
written in Python, such algorithms are very slow.
  We solve this problem by writing the same logic in a language that can be
executed quickly. AwkwardForth is a Domain Specific Language (DSL), based on
Standard Forth with I/O extensions for making Awkward Arrays, and it can be
interpreted as a fast virtual machine without requiring LLVM as a dependency.
We generate code as late as possible to take advantage of optimization
opportunities. All ROOT types previously implemented with Python have been
converted to AwkwardForth. Double and triple-jagged arrays, for example, are
400x faster in AwkwardForth than in Python, with multithreaded scaling up to 1
second/GB because AwkwardForth releases the Python GIL. We also investigate the
possibility of JIT-compiling the generated AwkwardForth code using LLVM to
increase the performance gains. In this paper, we describe design aspects,
performance studies, and future directions in accelerating Uproot with
AwkwardForth.

					<dc:description>  Recent advances in 3D object detection (3DOD) have obtained remarkably strong
results for LiDAR-based models. In contrast, surround-view 3DOD models based on
multiple camera images underperform due to the necessary view transformation of
features from perspective view (PV) to a 3D world representation which is
ambiguous due to missing depth information. This paper introduces X$^3$KD, a
comprehensive knowledge distillation framework across different modalities,
tasks, and stages for multi-camera 3DOD. Specifically, we propose cross-task
distillation from an instance segmentation teacher (X-IS) in the PV feature
extraction stage providing supervision without ambiguous error backpropagation
through the view transformation. After the transformation, we apply cross-modal
feature distillation (X-FD) and adversarial training (X-AT) to improve the 3D
world representation of multi-camera features through the information contained
in a LiDAR-based 3DOD teacher. Finally, we also employ this teacher for
cross-modal output distillation (X-OD), providing dense supervision at the
prediction stage. We perform extensive ablations of knowledge distillation at
different stages of multi-camera 3DOD. Our final X$^3$KD model outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets and
generalizes to RADAR-based 3DOD. Qualitative results video at

					<dc:description>  In recent years, we have witnessed a growing interest in data science not
only from academia but particularly from companies investing in data science
platforms to analyze large amounts of data. In this process, a myriad of data
science artifacts, such as datasets and pipeline scripts, are created. Yet,
there has so far been no systematic attempt to holistically exploit the
collected knowledge and experiences that are implicitly contained in the
specification of these pipelines, e.g., compatible datasets, cleansing steps,
ML algorithms, parameters, etc. Instead, data scientists still spend a
considerable amount of their time trying to recover relevant information and
experiences from colleagues, trial and error, lengthy exploration, etc. In this
paper, we, therefore, propose a scalable system (KGLiDS) that employs machine
learning to extract the semantics of data science pipelines and captures them
in a knowledge graph, which can then be exploited to assist data scientists in
various ways. This abstraction is the key to enabling Linked Data Science since
it allows us to share the essence of pipelines between platforms, companies,
and institutions without revealing critical internal information and instead
focusing on the semantics of what is being processed and how. Our comprehensive
evaluation uses thousands of datasets and more than thirteen thousand pipeline
scripts extracted from data discovery benchmarks and the Kaggle portal and
shows that KGLiDS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems on related
tasks, such as dataset recommendation and pipeline classification.

					<dc:description>  There are undeniable benefits of binding Python and C++ to take advantage of
the best features of both languages. This is especially relevant to the HEP and
other scientific communities that have invested heavily in the C++ frameworks
and are rapidly moving their data analyses to Python. Version 2 of Awkward
Array, a Scikit-HEP Python library, introduces a set of header-only C++
libraries that do not depend on any application binary interface. Users can
directly include these libraries in their compilation rather than linking
against platform-specific libraries. This new development makes the integration
of Awkward Arrays into other projects easier and more portable as the
implementation is easily separable from the rest of the Awkward Array codebase.
The code is minimal, it does not include all of the code needed to use Awkward
Arrays in Python, nor does it include references to Python or pybind11. The C++
users can use it to make arrays and then copy them to Python without any
specialized data types - only raw buffers, strings, and integers. This C++ code
also simplifies the process of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in ROOT. This
implementation approach solves some of the drawbacks, like packaging projects
where native dependencies can be challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the
technique to integrate C++ and Python by using a header-only approach. We also
describe the implementation of a new LayoutBuilder and a GrowableBuffer.
Furthermore, examples of wrapping the C++ data into Awkward Arrays and exposing
Awkward Arrays to C++ without copying them are discussed.

					<dc:description>  Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is the task of answering
natural language questions over a knowledge graph (KG). This task requires a
model to reason over multiple edges of the KG to reach the right answer. In
this work, we present a method to equip large language models (LLMs) with
classic logical programming languages to provide an explainable solution to the
problem. Our goal is to extract the representation of the question in the form
of a Prolog query, which can then be used to answer the query programmatically.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we use the MetaQA dataset
and show that our method finds the correct answer entities for all the
questions in the test dataset.

					<dc:description>  Data-driven visual odometry (VO) is a critical subroutine for autonomous edge
robotics, and recent progress in the field has produced highly accurate point
predictions in complex environments. However, emerging autonomous edge robotics
devices like insect-scale drones and surgical robots lack a computationally
efficient framework to estimate VO's predictive uncertainties. Meanwhile, as
edge robotics continue to proliferate into mission-critical application spaces,
awareness of model's the predictive uncertainties has become crucial for
risk-aware decision-making. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a
novel, lightweight, and statistically robust framework that leverages conformal
inference (CI) to extract VO's uncertainty bands. Our approach represents the
uncertainties using flexible, adaptable, and adjustable prediction intervals
that, on average, guarantee the inclusion of the ground truth across all
degrees of freedom (DOF) of pose estimation. We discuss the architectures of
generative deep neural networks for estimating multivariate uncertainty bands
along with point (mean) prediction. We also present techniques to improve the
uncertainty estimation accuracy, such as leveraging Monte Carlo dropout
(MC-dropout) for data augmentation. Finally, we propose a novel training loss
function that combines interval scoring and calibration loss with traditional
training metrics--mean-squared error and KL-divergence--to improve
uncertainty-aware learning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the
presented framework consistently captures true uncertainty in pose estimations
across different datasets, estimation models, and applied noise types,
indicating its wide applicability.

					<dc:description>  Quantum systems subject to periodic driving exhibit a diverse set of
phenomena both of fundamental and technological interest. However, such
dynamical systems are more challenging to simulate classically than their
equilibrium counterparts. Here, we introduce the Quantum High Frequency Floquet
Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method for simulating the dynamics of
fast-driven Floquet systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the
concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the
dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows
prior methods for time-independent Hamiltonian simulation to be lifted to the
simulation of Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial
next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model as a case study to illustrate our
algorithm. This oft-studied model is a natural test bed for quantum frustrated
magnetism and criticality. We successfully implemented a 20-qubit simulation of
the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum
computer. This is complemented with an analysis of QHiFFS algorithmic errors.
Our study indicates that the algorithm exhibits not only a cubic scaling
advantage in driving frequency $\omega$ but also a linear one in simulation
time $t$ compared to Trotterisation, making it an interesting avenue to push
towards near-term quantum advantage.

					<dc:description>  Tissue growth underpins a wide array of biological and developmental
processes, and numerical modeling of growing systems has been shown to be a
useful tool for understanding these processes. However, the phenomena that can
be captured are often limited by the size of systems that can be modeled. Here,
we address this limitation by introducing a Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) for
a growing system that is able to efficiently model hydrodynamic length-scales.
The model incorporates a novel approach to describing the growing front of a
tissue, which we use to investigate the dynamics of the interface of growing
model tissues. We find that the interface grows with scaling in agreement with
the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class when growth in the system is
bulk driven. Interestingly, we also find the emergence of a previously
unreported hydrodynamic instability when proliferation is restricted to the
tissue edge. We then develop an analytical theory to show that the instability
arises due to a coupling between the number of cells actively proliferating and
the position of the interface.

					<dc:description>  In deriving the formula for spontaneous emission rate, typical textbooks
often use physically motivated but mathematically unjustified (and sometimes
even contradictory) approximations. The commonly used dipole approximation
applied to the entire frequency spectrum results in the appearance of divergent
integrals in the derivations. It is known from the literature that the
introduction of cutoff for frequencies, justified by the finite size of the
atom, may solve this problem. For didactic purposes, we introduce a
mathematically simple cutoff, which allows for a rigorous rederivation of
Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission formula. Importantly, this is not a
mathematical trick to make calculations easier but is related to a real feature
of the physical system, the neglect of which leads to inconsistency.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that allows the
use of distributed data without compromising personal privacy. However, the
heterogeneous distribution of data among clients in FL can make it difficult
for the orchestration server to validate the integrity of local model updates,
making FL vulnerable to various threats, including backdoor attacks. Backdoor
attacks involve the insertion of malicious functionality into a targeted model
through poisoned updates from malicious clients. These attacks can cause the
global model to misbehave on specific inputs while appearing normal in other
cases. Backdoor attacks have received significant attention in the literature
due to their potential to impact real-world deep learning applications.
However, they have not been thoroughly studied in the context of FL. In this
survey, we provide a comprehensive survey of current backdoor attack strategies
and defenses in FL, including a comprehensive analysis of different approaches.
We also discuss the challenges and potential future directions for attacks and
defenses in the context of FL.

					<dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly being integrated into
embedded and IoT systems that surround us, and they are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. The deployment of these ML algorithms on resource-limited
embedded platforms also requires the use of model compression techniques. The
impact of such model compression techniques on adversarial robustness in ML is
an important and emerging area of research. This article provides an overview
of the landscape of adversarial attacks and ML model compression techniques
relevant to embedded systems. We then describe efforts that seek to understand
the relationship between adversarial attacks and ML model compression before
discussing open problems in this area.

					<dc:description>  The deployment of Reinforcement Learning to robotics applications faces the
difficulty of reward engineering. Therefore, approaches have focused on
creating reward functions by Learning from Observations (LfO) which is the task
of learning policies from expert trajectories that only contain state
sequences. We propose new methods for LfO for the important class of continuous
control problems of learning to stabilize, by introducing intermediate proxy
models acting as reward functions between the expert and the agent policy based
on Lyapunov stability theory. Our LfO training process consists of two steps.
The first step attempts to learn a Lyapunov-like landscape proxy model from
expert state sequences without access to any kinematics model, and the second
step uses the learned landscape model to guide in training the learner's
policy. We formulate novel learning objectives for the two steps that are
important for overall training success. We evaluate our methods in real
automobile robot environments and other simulated stabilization control
problems in model-free settings, like Quadrotor control and maintaining upright
positions of Hopper in MuJoCo. We compare with state-of-the-art approaches and
show the proposed methods can learn efficiently with less expert observations.

					<dc:description>  Machine learning methods, particularly recent advances in equivariant graph
neural networks (GNNs), have been investigated as surrogate models to expensive
ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) approaches for molecular potential
predictions. However, building accurate and transferable potential models using
GNNs remains challenging, as the quality and quantity of data are greatly
limited by QM calculations, especially for large and complex molecular systems.
In this work, we propose denoise pre-training on non-equilibrium molecular
conformations to achieve more accurate and transferable GNN potential
predictions. Specifically, GNNs are pre-trained by predicting the random noises
added to atomic coordinates of sampled non-equilibrium conformations. Rigorous
experiments on multiple benchmarks reveal that pre-training significantly
improves the accuracy of neural potentials. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed pre-training approach is model-agnostic, as it improves the
performance of different invariant and equivariant GNNs. Notably, our models
pre-trained on small molecules demonstrate remarkable transferability,
improving performance when fine-tuned on diverse molecular systems, including
different elements, charged molecules, biomolecules, and larger systems. These
results highlight the potential for leveraging denoise pre-training approaches
to build more generalizable neural potentials for complex molecular systems.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, there have been a growing number of observations indicating
the presence of rocky material in short-period orbits around white dwarfs. In
this Letter, we revisit the prospects for habitability around these
post-main-sequence star systems. In addition to the typically considered
radiative input luminosity, potentially habitable planets around white dwarfs
are also subjected to significant tidal heating. The combination of these two
heating sources can, for a narrow range of planetary properties and orbital
parameters, continuously maintain surface temperatures amenable for
habitability for planets around white dwarfs over time scales up to 10 Gyr. We
show that for a specific locus of orbital parameter space, tidal heating can
substantially extend the timescale of continuous habitability for a planet
around a white dwarf.

					<dc:description>  While the topological classification of matter has resulted in the prediction
and detection of unique topological phases in both insulators and metals,
materials that support an interplay between topology and interactions are
particularly interesting. We report the discovery that the topologically
non-trivial cubic double Dirac metal EuPd3S4 undergoes long-range charge
ordering at TCO = 340 K wherein Eu ions on a body-centered-cubic lattice divide
into interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, one occupied by magnetic Eu2+ the
other by non-magnetic Eu3+. The reduced symmetry transmutes the 8-fold double
Dirac states into 4-fold Dirac states and leads to the formation of an
isotropic simple cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AFM) that subsequently
develops G-type AFM order at TN = 2.85(6) K. While time reversal symmetry is
broken at this second order phase transition, its combination with the nearest
neighbor lattice translation forms a non-symmorphic symmetry operation that
preserves the 4-fold Dirac point. Application of a magnetic field at low
temperatures yields a spin flop transition followed by a fully magnetized
charge ordered state. Our work demonstrates how the collective phenomena of
charge and spin ordering in EuPd3S4 modify electronic topology and provides a
full experimental view of the field-temperature phase diagram of the simple
cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents NSGA-PINN, a multi-objective optimization framework for
effective training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The proposed
framework uses the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to enable
traditional stochastic gradient optimization algorithms (e.g., ADAM) to escape
local minima effectively. Additionally, the NSGA-II algorithm enables
satisfying the initial and boundary conditions encoded into the loss function
during physics-informed training precisely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework by applying NSGA-PINN to several ordinary and partial
differential equation problems. In particular, we show that the proposed
framework can handle challenging inverse problems with noisy data.

					<dc:description>  Metal halide perovskite-based materials have emerged over the past few
decades as remarkable solution-processable opto-electronic materials with many
intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have
recently been considered for their promise in low-energy memory and information
processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross-sections,
high photoconductance contrast, large carrier diffusion lengths, and mixed
electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory
elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical
domain. Here, we review recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic
functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons
are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and
neuromorphic functionality.

					<dc:description>  We describe a scheme to exchange fermion parity between two pairs of Majorana
bound states mediated by coupling with a centralized quantum dot. We
specifically formulate such a scheme for Majorana bound states nucleated in the
Josephson vortices formed in a four-fold crossroads junction of planar
topological superconductors in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.
This platform yields several advantages to the execution of our scheme as
compared to similar ideas proposed in wire geometries, including control over
the positions of the MBS and hence, a tunable coupling with the quantum dot. We
show that moving the MBS along the junctions through voltage pulses can
facilitate parity exchange via a two-step process, with intermediate projective
measurements of the quantum dot charge. Thus, we formulate a way to achieve
single qubit operations for MBS in extended Josephson junctions through
projective measurements of quantum dot charge. We also discuss the physical
viability of our scheme with a particular focus on changes in quantum dot
energy levels as a measurable indicator of the success of the scheme.

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Renormalization is a powerful technique in statistical physics to extract the
large-scale behavior of interacting many-body models. These notes aim to give
an introduction to perturbative methods that operate on the level of the
stochastic evolution equation for a scalar field (e.g., density), including
systems that are driven away from equilibrium and thus lack a free energy.
While there is a large number of reviews and lecture notes, many are somewhat
scarce on technical details and written in the language of quantum field
theory, which can be more confusing than helpful. Here we attempt a minimal and
concise yet pedagogical introduction to dynamic renormalization in the language
of statistical physics with a strong focus on how to actually perform
calculations. We provide a symbolic algebra implementation of the discussed
techniques including Jupyter notebooks of two illustrations: the KPZ equation
and a neural network model.

					<dc:description>  This work investigates the importance of feature selection for improving the
forecasting performance of machine learning algorithms for financial data.
Artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN),
long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, as well as linear models were applied
for forecasting purposes. The Feature Selection with Annealing (FSA) algorithm
was used to select the features from about 1000 possible predictors obtained
from 26 technical indicators with specific periods and their lags. In addition
to this, the Boruta feature selection algorithm was applied as a baseline
feature selection method. The dependent variables consisted of daily
logarithmic returns and daily trends of ten financial data sets, including
cryptocurrency and different stocks. Experiments indicate that the FSA
algorithm increased the performance of ML models regardless of the problem
type. The FSA hybrid machine learning models showed better performance in 10
out of 10 data sets for regression and 8 out of 10 data sets for
classification. None of the hybrid Boruta models outperformed the hybrid FSA
models. However, the BORCNN model performance was comparable to the best model
for 4 out of 10 data sets for regression estimates. BOR-LR and BOR-CNN models
showed comparable performance with the best hybrid FSA models in 2 out of 10
datasets for classification. FSA was observed to improve the model performance
in both better performance metrics as well as a decreased computation time by
providing a lower dimensional input feature space.

					<dc:description>  A lattice of integers is the collection of all linear combinations of a set
of vectors for which all entries of the vectors are integers and all
coefficients in the linear combinations are also integers. Lattice reduction
refers to the problem of finding a set of vectors in a given lattice such that
the collection of all integer linear combinations of this subset is still the
entire original lattice and so that the Euclidean norms of the subset are
reduced. The present paper proposes simple, efficient iterations for lattice
reduction which are guaranteed to reduce the Euclidean norms of the basis
vectors (the vectors in the subset) monotonically during every iteration. Each
iteration selects the basis vector for which projecting off (with integer
coefficients) the components of the other basis vectors along the selected
vector minimizes the Euclidean norms of the reduced basis vectors. Each
iteration projects off the components along the selected basis vector and
efficiently updates all information required for the next iteration to select
its best basis vector and perform the associated projections.

					<dc:description>  The problem of model selection with a limited number of experimental trials
has received considerable attention in cognitive science, where the role of
experiments is to discriminate between theories expressed as computational
models. Research on this subject has mostly been restricted to optimal
experiment design with analytically tractable models. However, cognitive models
of increasing complexity, with intractable likelihoods, are becoming more
commonplace. In this paper, we propose BOSMOS: an approach to experimental
design that can select between computational models without tractable
likelihoods. It does so in a data-efficient manner, by sequentially and
adaptively generating informative experiments. In contrast to previous
approaches, we introduce a novel simulator-based utility objective for design
selection, and a new approximation of the model likelihood for model selection.
In simulated experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed BOSMOS technique can
accurately select models in up to 2 orders of magnitude less time than existing
LFI alternatives for three cognitive science tasks: memory retention,
sequential signal detection and risky choice.

					<dc:description>  We consider the restricted Jordan plane in characteristic $2$, a
finite-dimensional Nichols algebra quotient of the Jordan plane that was
introduced by Cibils, Lauve and Witherspoon. We extend results from
\texttt{arXiv:2002.02514} on the analogous object in odd characteristic. We
show that the Drinfeld double of the restricted Jordan plane fits into an exact
sequence of Hopf algebras whose kernel is a normal local commutative Hopf
subalgebra and the cokernel is the restricted enveloping algebra of a
restricted Lie algebra $\mathfrak m$ of dimension 5. We show that $\mathfrak
u(\mathfrak m)$ is tame and compute explicitly the indecomposable modules. An
infinite-dimensional Hopf algebra covering the Drinfeld double of the
restricted Jordan plane is introduced. Various quantum Frobenius maps are
described.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces a new generic problem to the literature of Workforce
Scheduling and Routing Problem. In this problem, multiple workers are assigned
to a shared vehicle based on their qualifications and customer demands, and
then the route is formed so that a traveler may be dropped off and picked up
later to minimize total flow time. We introduced a mixed-integer linear
programming model for the problem. To solve the problem, an Adaptive Large
Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm was developed with problem-specific
heuristics and a decomposition-based constructive upper bound algorithm (UBA).
To analyze the impact of newly introduced policies, service area, difficulty of
service, distribution of care, and number of demand nodes type instance
characteristics are considered. The empirical analyses showed that the ALNS
algorithm presents solutions with up to 35% less total flow time than the UBA.
The implementation of the proposed drop-off and pick-up (DP) and vehicle
sharing policies present up to 24% decrease in total flow time or provide
savings on the total cost of service especially when the demand nodes are
located in small areas like in urban areas.

					<dc:description>  This paper provides the first milestone in measuring the floor space of
buildings (that is, building footprint and height) and its evolution over time
for China. Doing so requires building on imagery that is of a
medium-fine-grained granularity, as longer cross-sections and time series data
across many cities are only available in such format. We use a multi-class
object segmenter approach to gauge the floor space of buildings in the same
framework: first, we determine whether a surface area is covered by buildings
(the square footage of occupied land); second, we need to determine the height
of buildings from their imagery. We then use Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite images
as our main data source. The benefits of these data are their large
cross-sectional and longitudinal scope plus their unrestricted accessibility.
We provide a detailed description of the algorithms used to generate the data
and the results. We analyze the preprocessing steps of reference data (if not
ground truth data) and their consequences for measuring the building floor
space. We also discuss the future steps in building a time series on urban
development based on our preliminary experimental results.

					<dc:description>  An almost abelian Lie group is a solvable Lie group with a codimension-one
normal abelian subgroup. We characterize almost Hermitian structures on almost
abelian Lie groups where the almost complex structure is harmonic with respect
to the Hermitian metric. Also, we adapt the Gray-Hervella classification of
almost Hermitian structures to the family of almost abelian Lie groups. We
provide several examples of harmonic almost complex structures in different
Gray-Hervella classes on some associated compact almost abelian solvmanifolds.

					<dc:title>Generalization of the tensor product selected CI method for molecular

					<dc:creator>Braunscheidel, Nicole M.</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Physics - Chemical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In a recent paper (JCTC, 16, 6098 (2020)), we introduced a new approach for
accurately approximating full CI ground states in large electronic
active-spaces, called Tensor Product Selected CI (TPSCI). In TPSCI, a large
orbital active space is first partitioned into disjoint sets (clusters) for
which the exact local many-body eigenstates are obtained. Tensor products of
these locally correlated many-body states are taken as the basis for the full,
global Hilbert space. By folding correlation into the basis states themselves,
the low-energy eigenstates become increasingly sparse, creating a more compact
selected CI expansion. While we demonstrated that this approach can improve
accuracy for a variety of systems, there is even greater potential for
applications to excited states, particularly those which have some excitonic
character. In this paper, we report on the accuracy of TPSCI for excited
states, including a far more efficient implementation in the Julia programming
language. In traditional SCI methods that use a Slater determinant basis,
accurate excitation energies are obtained only after a linear extrapolation and
at a large computational cost. We find that TPSCI with perturbative corrections
provides accurate excitation energies for several excited states of various
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with respect to the extrapolated result
(i.e. near exact result). Further, we use TPSCI to report highly accurate
estimates of the lowest 31 eigenstates for a tetracene tetramer system with an
active space of 40 electrons in 40 orbitals, giving direct access to the
initial bright states and the resulting 18 biexcitonic states.

					<dc:description>  Single-qubit sensing protocols can be used to measure qubit-bath coupling
parameters. However, for sufficiently large coupling, the sensing protocol
itself perturbs the bath, which is predicted to result in a characteristic
response in the sensing measurements. Here, we observe this bath perturbation,
also known as a quantum quench, by preparing the nuclear spin bath of a
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in polarized initial states and performing
phase-resolved spin echo measurements on the NV electron spin. These
measurements reveal a time-dependent phase determined by the initial state of
the bath. We derive the relationship between sensor phase and Gaussian spin
bath polarization, and apply it to reconstruct both the axial and transverse
polarization components. Using this insight, we optimize the transfer
efficiency of our dynamic nuclear polarization sequence. This technique for
directly measuring bath polarization may assist in preparing high-fidelity
quantum memory states, improving nanoscale NMR methods, and investigating
non-Gaussian quantum baths.

					<dc:description>  Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in solving complex tasks
when large amounts of data can be generated with little effort. In robotics,
one approach to generate training data builds on simulations based on dynamics
models derived from first principles. However, for tasks that, for instance,
involve complex soft robots, devising such models is substantially more
challenging. Being able to train effectively in increasingly complicated
scenarios with reinforcement learning enables to take advantage of complex
systems such as soft robots. Here, we leverage the imbalance in complexity of
the dynamics to learn more sample-efficiently. We (i) abstract the task into
distinct components, (ii) off-load the simple dynamics parts into the
simulation, and (iii) multiply these virtual parts to generate more data in
hindsight. Our new method, Hindsight States (HiS), uses this data and selects
the most useful transitions for training. It can be used with an arbitrary
off-policy algorithm. We validate our method on several challenging simulated
tasks and demonstrate that it improves learning both alone and when combined
with an existing hindsight algorithm, Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).
Finally, we evaluate HiS on a physical system and show that it boosts
performance on a complex table tennis task with a muscular robot. Videos and
code of the experiments can be found on webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/his/.

Lam\'e-Wangerin functions called internal and external bi-cyclide harmonics. An
expansion for the fundamental solution of Laplace's equation in products of
internal and external bi-cyclide harmonics is derived. In limiting cases this
expansion reduces to known expansion in bi-spherical and prolate spheroidal

rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile which in itself is
obtained via a doubly constrained energy minimization. One of the two
constraints imposed is the total mass, while the other is given by the
expectation value of the angular momentum around the z-axis. Our approach also
allows for a new description of the set of minimizers subject to only a single
mass constraint.

					<dc:description>  High-speed long polynomial multiplication is important for applications in
homomorphic encryption (HE) and lattice-based cryptosystems. This paper
addresses low-latency hardware architectures for long polynomial modular
multiplication using the number-theoretic transform (NTT) and inverse NTT
(iNTT). Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is used to decompose the modulus into
multiple smaller moduli. Our proposed architecture, namely PaReNTT, makes four
novel contributions. First, parallel NTT and iNTT architectures are proposed to
reduce the number of clock cycles to process the polynomials. This can enable
real-time processing for HE applications, as the number of clock cycles to
process the polynomial is inversely proportional to the level of parallelism.
Second, the proposed architecture eliminates the need for permuting the NTT
outputs before their product is input to the iNTT. This reduces latency by n/4
clock cycles, where n is the length of the polynomial, and reduces buffer
requirement by one delay-switch-delay circuit of size n. Third, an approach to
select special moduli is presented where the moduli can be expressed in terms
of a few signed power-of-two terms. Fourth, novel architectures for
pre-processing for computing residual polynomials using the CRT and
post-processing for combining the residual polynomials are proposed. These
architectures significantly reduce the area consumption of the pre-processing
and post-processing steps. The proposed long modular polynomial multiplications
are ideal for applications that require low latency and high sample rate as
these feed-forward architectures can be pipelined at arbitrary levels.

					<dc:description>  Mixed halide chemistry has recently been utilized to tune the intrinsic
magnetic properties of transition-metal halides $-$ one of the largest families
of magnetic van der Waals materials. Prior studies have shown that the strength
of exchange interactions, hence the critical temperature, can be tuned smoothly
with halide composition for a given ground-state. Here we show that the
ground-state itself can be altered by a small change of halide composition
leading to a quantum phase transition in FeCl$_{3-x}$Br$_x$. Specifically, we
find a three-fold jump in the N\'{e}el temperature and a sign change in the
Weiss temperature at $x= 0.08$ corresponding to only $3\%$ bromine doping.
Using neutron scattering, we reveal a change of the ground-state from spiral
order in FeCl$_3$ to A-type antiferromagnetic order in FeBr$_3$. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that a delicate balance between nearest
and next-nearest neighbor interactions is responsible for such a transition.
These results support the proximity of FeCl$_3$ to a spiral spin liquid state,
in which competing interactions and nearly degenerate magnetic $k$-vectors may
cause large changes in response to small perturbations.

Ti2CF2. We study the effect of different surface terminations and monosheet

conductivity can be explained by the squared velocity density of the electronic

linearized solutions, namely, the self-energy relaxation time approximation
(SERTA) and the momentum relaxation time approximation (MRTA), and we show that
the SERTA significantly underestimates the electrical conductivity while the

analogous asymptotic growth of the coefficients of two general families of
functions related to integer partitions. In particular, we resolve several
conjectures and verify several claims that are posted on the On-Line
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. We perform the asymptotic analysis by
systematically applying the Mellin transform, residue analysis, and the saddle
point method. The combinatorial descriptions of these families of generalized
partition functions involve colorings of Young tableaux, along with their
``divisor diagrams'', denoted with sets of colors whose sizes are controlled by
divisor functions.

					<dc:description>  Histopathology is critical for the diagnosis of many diseases, including
cancer. These protocols typically require pathologists to manually evaluate
slides under a microscope, which is time-consuming and subjective, leading to
interest in machine learning to automate analysis. However, computational
techniques are limited by batch effects, where technical factors like
differences in preparation protocol or scanners can alter the appearance of
slides, causing models trained on one institution to fail when generalizing to
others. Here, we propose a domain adaptation method that improves the
generalization of histopathological models to data from unseen institutions,
without the need for labels or retraining in these new settings. Our approach
introduces an optimal transport (OT) loss, that extends adversarial methods
that penalize models if images from different institutions can be distinguished
in their representation space. Unlike previous methods, which operate on single
samples, our loss accounts for distributional differences between batches of
images. We show that on the Camelyon17 dataset, while both methods can adapt to
global differences in color distribution, only our OT loss can reliably
classify a cancer phenotype unseen during training. Together, our results
suggest that OT improves generalization on rare but critical phenotypes that
may only make up a small fraction of the total tiles and variation in a slide.

					<dc:description>  In Natural Language Processing (NLP), intelligent neuron models can be
susceptible to textual Trojan attacks. Such attacks occur when Trojan models
behave normally for standard inputs but generate malicious output for inputs
that contain a specific trigger. Syntactic-structure triggers, which are
invisible, are becoming more popular for Trojan attacks because they are
difficult to detect and defend against. However, these types of attacks require
a large corpus of training data to generate poisoned samples with the necessary
syntactic structures for Trojan insertion. Obtaining such data can be difficult
for attackers, and the process of generating syntactic poisoned triggers and
inserting Trojans can be time-consuming. This paper proposes a solution called
TrojText, which aims to determine whether invisible textual Trojan attacks can
be performed more efficiently and cost-effectively without training data. The
proposed approach, called the Representation-Logit Trojan Insertion (RLI)
algorithm, uses smaller sampled test data instead of large training data to
achieve the desired attack. The paper also introduces two additional
techniques, namely the accumulated gradient ranking (AGR) and Trojan Weights
Pruning (TWP), to reduce the number of tuned parameters and the attack
overhead. The TrojText approach was evaluated on three datasets (AG's News,
SST-2, and OLID) using three NLP models (BERT, XLNet, and DeBERTa). The
experiments demonstrated that the TrojText approach achieved a 98.35\%
classification accuracy for test sentences in the target class on the BERT
model for the AG's News dataset. The source code for TrojText is available at
https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/TrojText.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks are an attractive alternative for simulating complex
dynamical systems, as in comparison to traditional scientific computing
methods, they offer reduced computational costs during inference and can be
trained directly from observational data. Existing methods, however, cannot
extrapolate accurately and are prone to error accumulation in long-time
integration. Herein, we address this issue by combining neural operators with
recurrent neural networks to construct a novel and effective architecture,
resulting in superior accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. The new hybrid
model is based on operator learning while offering a recurrent structure to
capture temporal dependencies. The integrated framework is shown to stabilize
the solution and reduce error accumulation for both interpolation and
extrapolation of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.

					<dc:creator>Graf-Vlachy, Lorenz</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Wagner, Stefan</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Background: Technical debt (TD) has been widely discussed in software
engineering research, and there is an emerging literature linking it to
developer characteristics. However, developer personality has not yet been
studied in this context. Aims and Method: We explore the relationship between
various personality traits (Five Factor Model, regulatory focus, and
narcissism) of developers and the introduction and removal of TD. To this end,
we complement an existing TD dataset with novel self-report personality data
gathered by surveying developers, and analyze 2,145 commits from 19 developers.
Results: We find that conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness to
experience, and prevention focus are negatively associated with TD. There were
no significant results for extraversion, agreeableness, promotion focus, or
narcissism. Conclusions: We take our results as first evidence that developer
personality has a systematic influence on the introduction and removal of TD.
This has implications not only for future research, which could, for example,
study the effects of personality on downstream consequences of TD like defects,
but also for software engineering practitioners who may, for example, consider
developer personality in staffing decisions.

					<dc:description>  The success of self-supervised learning (SSL) has mostly been attributed to
the availability of unlabeled yet large-scale datasets. However, in a
specialized domain such as medical imaging which is a lot different from
natural images, the assumption of data availability is unrealistic and
impractical, as the data itself is scanty and found in small databases,
collected for specific prognosis tasks. To this end, we seek to investigate the
applicability of self-supervised learning algorithms on small-scale medical
imaging datasets. In particular, we evaluate $4$ state-of-the-art SSL methods
on three publicly accessible \emph{small} medical imaging datasets. Our
investigation reveals that in-domain low-resource SSL pre-training can yield
competitive performance to transfer learning from large-scale datasets (such as
ImageNet). Furthermore, we extensively analyse our empirical findings to
provide valuable insights that can motivate for further research towards
circumventing the need for pre-training on a large image corpus. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to holistically explore
self-supervision on low-resource medical datasets.

					<dc:description>  The reliable integration of wind energy into modern-day electricity systems
heavily relies on accurate short-term wind forecasts. We propose a
spatio-temporal model called AIRU-WRF (short for the AI-powered Rutgers
University Weather Research &amp; Forecasting), which fuses numerical weather
predictions (NWPs) with local observations in order to make wind speed
forecasts that are short-term (minutes to hours ahead), and of high resolution,
both spatially (site-specific) and temporally (minute-level). In contrast to
purely data-driven methods, we undertake a &quot;physics-guided&quot; machine learning
approach which captures salient physical features of the local wind field
without the need to explicitly solve for those physics, including: (i) modeling
wind field advection and diffusion via physically meaningful kernel functions,
(ii) integrating exogenous predictors that are both meteorologically relevant
and statistically significant; and (iii) linking the multi-type NWP biases to
their driving meso-scale weather conditions. Tested on real-world data from the
U.S. North Atlantic where several offshore wind projects are in-development,
AIRU-WRF achieves notable improvements, in terms of both wind speed and power,
relative to various forecasting benchmarks including physics-based, hybrid,
statistical, and deep learning methods.

					<dc:description>  Twinning is an important deformation mode in plastically deformed hexagonal
close-packed materials. The extremely high twin growth rates at the nanoscale
make atomistic simulations an attractive method for investigating the role of
individual twin/matrix interfaces such as twin boundaries and basal-prismatic
interfaces in twin growth kinetics. Unfortunately, there is no single framework
that allows researchers to differentiate such interfaces automatically, neither
in experimental in-situ transmission electron microscopy analysis images nor in
atomistic simulations. Moreover, the presence of alloying elements introduces
substantial noise to local atomic environments, making it nearly impossible to
identify which atoms belong to which interface. Here, with the help of advanced
machine learning methods, we provide a proof-of-concept way of using the local
stress field distribution as an indicator for the presence of interfaces and
for determining their types. We apply such an analysis to the growth of twin
embryos in Mg-10 at.% Al alloys under constant stress and constant strain
conditions, corresponding to two extremes of high and low strain rates,
respectively. We discover that the kinetics of such growth is driven by
high-energy basal-prismatic interfaces, in line with our experimental
observations for pure Mg.

					<dc:description>  While no known asteroid poses a threat to Earth for at least the next
century, the catalog of near-Earth asteroids is incomplete for objects whose
impacts would produce regional devastation. Several approaches have been
proposed to potentially prevent an asteroid impact with Earth by deflecting or
disrupting an asteroid. A test of kinetic impact technology was identified as
the highest priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation. NASA's
Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is the first full-scale test of
kinetic impact technology. The mission's target asteroid was Dimorphos, the
secondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. This
binary asteroid system was chosen to enable ground-based telescopes to quantify
the asteroid deflection caused by DART's impact. While past missions have
utilized impactors to investigate the properties of small bodies those earlier
missions were not intended to deflect their targets and did not achieve
measurable deflections. Here we report the DART spacecraft's autonomous kinetic
impact into Dimorphos and reconstruct the impact event, including the timeline
leading to impact, the location and nature of the DART impact site, and the
size and shape of Dimorphos. The successful impact of the DART spacecraft with
Dimorphos and the resulting change in Dimorphos's orbit demonstrates that
kinetic impactor technology is a viable technique to potentially defend Earth
if necessary.

					<dc:description>  We prove a suite of dynamical results, including exactness of the
transformation and piecewise-analyticity of the invariant measure, for a family
of continued fraction systems, including specific examples over reals, complex
numbers, quaternions, octonions, and in $R^3$. Our methods expand on the work
of Nakada and Hensley, and in particular fill some gaps in Hensley's analysis
of Hurwitz complex continued fractions. We further introduce a new
``serendipity'' condition for a continued fraction algorithm, which controls
the long-term behavior of the boundary of the fundamental domain under
iteration of the continued fraction map, and which is under reasonable
conditions equivalent to the finite range property. We also show that the
finite range condition is extremely delicate: perturbations of serendipitous
systems by non-quadratic irrationals do not remain serendipitous, and
experimental evidence suggests that serendipity may fail even for some rational
perturbations.

					<dc:description>  Strong singularities in the electronic density of states amplify correlation
effects and play a key role in determining the ordering instabilities in
various materials. Recently high order van Hove singularities (VHSs) with
diverging power-law scaling have been classified in single-band electron
models. We show that the 110 surface of Bismuth exhibits high order VHS with
unusually high exponent of -0.7. Detailed mapping of the surface band structure
using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy shows that this
singularity occurs in close proximity with Dirac bands located at the center of
the surface Brillouin zone. The enhanced power-law divergence is shown to
originate from the anisotropic flattening of the Dirac band just above the
Dirac node. Such near-coexistence of massless Dirac electrons and ultra-massive
saddle points enables to study the interplay of high order VHS and Dirac
fermions.

					<dc:description>  Adversarial training aims to reduce the problematic susceptibility of modern
neural networks to small data perturbations. Surprisingly, overfitting is a
major concern in adversarial training of neural networks despite being mostly
absent in standard training. We provide here theoretical evidence for this
peculiar ``robust overfitting'' phenomenon. Subsequently, we advance a novel
loss function which we show both theoretically as well as empirically to enjoy
a certified level of robustness against data evasion and poisoning attacks
while ensuring guaranteed generalization. We indicate through careful numerical
experiments that our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields
SOTA performance in terms of adversarial error loss. Finally, we indicate that
HR training can be interpreted as a direct extension of adversarial training
and comes with a negligible additional computational burden.

					<dc:description>  When solving partial differential equations on scattered nodes using the
radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method, one of the
parameters that must be chosen is the stencil size. Focusing on Polyharmonic
Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that the stencil size
affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the
solution error dependence on stencil size has several local minima. We find
that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed
approximation error. Based on this observation we are then able to introduce a
numerical quantity that indicates whether a given stencil size is close to one
of those local minima.

coefficient of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of braid matroids, and provide
explicit generating functions for their Kazhdan--Lusztig and Z-polynomials.

					<dc:description>  Fast spin-echo (FSE) pulse sequences for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
offer important imaging contrast in clinically feasible scan times.
T2-shuffling is widely used to resolve temporal signal dynamics in FSE
acquisitions by exploiting temporal correlations via linear latent space and a
predefined regularizer. However, predefined regularizers fail to exploit the
incoherence especially for 2D acquisitions.Recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions by learning a regularizer from
undersampled data without a standard supervised training data set. In this
work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a self supervised learning
framework to learn a regularizer constrained on a linear latent space which
improves time-resolved FSE images reconstruction quality. Additionally, in
regimes without groundtruth sensitivity maps, we propose joint estimation of
coil-sensitivity maps using an iterative reconstruction technique. Our
technique functions is in a zero-shot fashion, as it only utilizes data from a
single scan of highly undersampled time series images. We perform experiments
on simulated and retrospective in-vivo data to evaluate the performance of the
proposed zero-shot learning method for temporal FSE reconstruction. The results
demonstrate the success of our proposed method where NMSE and SSIM are
significantly increased and the artifacts are reduced.

					<dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of learning a single ReLU neuron with
squared loss (a.k.a., ReLU regression) in the overparameterized regime, where
the input dimension can exceed the number of samples. We analyze a
Perceptron-type algorithm called GLM-tron (Kakade et al., 2011), and provide
its dimension-free risk upper bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in
both well-specified and misspecified settings. Our risk bounds recover several
existing results as special cases. Moreover, in the well-specified setting, we
also provide an instance-wise matching risk lower bound for GLM-tron. Our upper
and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization of the high-dimensional
ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron. On the other hand,
we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU
regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the
excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring
constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case,
GLM-tron can achieve a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant
risk in expectation. These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be
preferable than SGD for high-dimensional ReLU regression.

					<dc:description>  We~identify the standard weighted Bergman kernels of spaces of nearly
holomorphic functions, in~the sense of Shimura, on~bounded symmetric domains.
This also yields a description of the analogous kernels for spaces of
``invariantly-polyanalytic'' functions -- a~generalization of the ordinary
polyanalytic functions on the ball which seems to be the most appropriate one
from the point of view of holomorphic invariance. In~both cases, the~kernels
turn out to be given by certain spherical functions, or equivalently
Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric functions, and a conjecture relating some of these
to a Faraut-Koranyi hypergeometric function is formulated based on the study of
low rank situations. Finally, analogous results are established also for
compact Hermitian symmetric spaces, where explicit formulas in terms of
multivariable Jacobi polynomials are~given.

					<dc:description>  Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has received significant
attention in recent years due to its ability to estimate camera trajectory and
create an environment map using visual data alone, making a substantial
contribution to autonomous driving applications, in particular, a real-world
scenario with moving crowds and vehicles. In this work, we propose a visual
SLAM system that incorporates moving object trajectory tracking and prediction.
We take into account the motion clues of the pedestrians to track and predict
their movement, as long as mapping the environment. Such an integrated system
solves the localization of the camera and other moving objects in the scene,
and further creates a sparse map to support the potential navigation of the
vehicle. In the experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of
our approach through a comprehensive evaluation on both our simulation and
real-world KITTI datasets.

					<dc:description>  Technical debt describes situations where developers write less-than-optimal
code to meet project milestones. However, this debt accumulation often results
in future developer effort to live with or fix these quality issues. To better
manage this debt, developers may document their sub-optimal code as comments in
the code (i.e., self-admitted technical debt or SATD). While prior research has
investigated the occurrence and characteristics of SATD, this research has
primarily focused on non-mobile systems. With millions of mobile applications
(apps) in multiple genres available for end-users, there is a lack of research
on sub-optimal code developers intentionally implement in mobile apps.
  In this study, we examine the occurrence and characteristics of SATD in
15,614 open-source Android apps. Our findings show that even though such apps
contain occurrences of SATD, the volume per app (a median of 4) is lower than
in non-mobile systems, with most debt categorized as Code Debt. Additionally,
we identify typical elements in an app that are prone to intentional
sub-optimal implementations. We envision our findings supporting researchers
and tool vendors with building tools and techniques to support app developers
with app maintenance.

					<dc:description>  In large unknown environments, search operations can be much more
time-efficient with the use of multi-robot fleets by parallelizing efforts.
This means robots must efficiently perform collaborative mapping (exploration)
while simultaneously searching an area for victims (coverage). Previous
simultaneous mapping and planning techniques treat these problems as separate
and do not take advantage of the possibility for a unified approach. We propose
a novel exploration-coverage planner which bridges the mapping and search
domains by growing sets of random trees rooted upon a pose graph produced
through mapping to generate points of interest, or tasks. Furthermore, it is
important for the robots to first prioritize high information tasks to locate
the greatest number of victims in minimum time by balancing coverage and
exploration, which current methods do not address. Towards this goal, we also
present a new multi-robot task allocator that formulates a notion of a
hierarchical information heuristic for time-critical collaborative search. Our
results show that our algorithm produces 20% more coverage efficiency, defined
as average covered area per second, compared to the existing state-of-the-art.
Our algorithms and the rest of our multi-robot search stack is based in ROS and
made open source

					<dc:description>  A core component of human intelligence is the ability to identify abstract
patterns inherent in complex, high-dimensional perceptual data, as exemplified
by visual reasoning tasks such as Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Motivated
by the goal of designing AI systems with this capacity, recent work has focused
on evaluating whether neural networks can learn to solve RPM-like problems.
Previous work has generally found that strong performance on these problems
requires the incorporation of inductive biases that are specific to the RPM
problem format, raising the question of whether such models might be more
broadly useful. Here, we investigated the extent to which a general-purpose
mechanism for processing visual scenes in terms of objects might help promote
abstract visual reasoning. We found that a simple model, consisting only of an
object-centric encoder and a transformer reasoning module, achieved
state-of-the-art results on both of two challenging RPM-like benchmarks (PGM
and I-RAVEN), as well as a novel benchmark with greater visual complexity
(CLEVR-Matrices). These results suggest that an inductive bias for
object-centric processing may be a key component of abstract visual reasoning,
obviating the need for problem-specific inductive biases.

					<dc:description>  Optical conductivity measurements may provide access to distinct signatures
of Floquet electronic phases, which are described theoretically by their
quasienergy band structures. Here, we focus on characterizing experimental
observables of the Floquet graphene antidot lattice, which we introduced
previously [Phys. Rev. B 104, 174304 (2021)]. On the basis of Floquet linear
response theory, the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and Hall
optical conductivity are computed as a function of probe frequency. We find
that the number and positions of peaks in the response function are distinctive
of the different Floquet electronic phases, and identify multiple properties
with no equilibrium analog. First, for several intervals of probe frequencies,
the real part of the conductivity becomes negative, which we argue is
indicative of negative Joule heating. That is, the Floquet drive causes the
material to amplify the power of the probe (gain). Additionally, while there is
zero Hall response at equilibrium, the real and imaginary parts of the Floquet
Hall conductivity are non-zero and can be as large as the longitudinal
components. Lastly, driving-induced localization tends to reduce the overall
magnitude of and to flatten out the optical conductivity signal. From an
implementation standpoint, a major advantage of the antidot lattice is that the
above-bandwidth driving limit is reached with photon energies that are at least
twenty times lower than that required for the intrinsic material, allowing for
significant band renormalization at orders-of-magnitude smaller intensities.
Our work provides the necessary tools for experimentalists to map reflectance
data to particular Floquet phases for this novel material.

					<dc:description>  Implicit layer deep learning techniques, like Neural Differential Equations,
have become an important modeling framework due to their ability to adapt to
new problems automatically. Training a neural differential equation is
effectively a search over a space of plausible dynamical systems. However,
controlling the computational cost for these models is difficult since it
relies on the number of steps the adaptive solver takes. Most prior works have
used higher-order methods to reduce prediction timings while greatly increasing
training time or reducing both training and prediction timings by relying on
specific training algorithms, which are harder to use as a drop-in replacement
due to strict requirements on automatic differentiation. In this manuscript, we
use internal cost heuristics of adaptive differential equation solvers at
stochastic time points to guide the training toward learning a dynamical system
that is easier to integrate. We &quot;close the black-box&quot; and allow the use of our
method with any adjoint technique for gradient calculations of the differential
equation solution. We perform experimental studies to compare our method to
global regularization to show that we attain similar performance numbers
without compromising the flexibility of implementation on ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We develop two
sampling strategies to trade off between performance and training time. Our
method reduces the number of function evaluations to 0.556-0.733x and
accelerates predictions by 1.3-2x.

					<dc:description>  Globular clusters (GCs) are found in all types of galaxies and harbor some of
the most extreme stellar systems, including black holes that may dynamically
assemble into merging binaries (BBHs). Despite their ubiquity, the origin and
evolution of GCs remains an open question. Uncertain GC properties, including
when they formed, their initial masses and sizes, affect their production rate
of BBH mergers. Using the gravitational-wave catalog GWTC-3, we measure that
dynamically-assembled BBHs -- those that are consistent with isotropic spin
directions -- make up $61^{+29}_{-44}\%$ of the total merger rate, with a local
merger rate of $10.9^{+16.8}_{-9.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ rising to
$58.9^{+149.4}_{-46.0}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z = 1$. We assume this
inferred rate describes the contribution from GCs and compare it against the
Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) simulation catalog to directly fit for the GC initial
mass function, virial radius distribution, and formation history. We find that
GC initial masses are consistent with a Schechter function with slope $\beta_m
= -1.9^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. Assuming a mass function slope of $\beta_m = -2$ and a
mass range between $10^4$--$10^8\,M_\odot$, we infer a GC formation rate at $z
= 2$ of $5.2^{+9.4}_{-4.1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, or $2.2^{+4.0}_{-1.7}\times
10^6\,M_\odot$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in terms of mass density. We find that the
GC formation rate probably rises more steeply than the global star formation
rate between $z = 0$ and $z = 3$ (84\% credibility) and implies a local number
density that is $f_\mathrm{ev} = 22.8^{+29.8}_{-16.5}$ times higher than the
observed density of survived GCs. This is consistent with expectations for
cluster evaporation, but may suggest that other environments contribute to the
rate of BBH mergers with significantly tilted spins.

					<dc:description>  Understanding many-electron phenomena with competing near-degenerate
electronic states is of fundamental importance to chemistry and condensed
matter physics. One of the most significant challenges for exploring such
many-electron phenomena is the necessity for large system sizes in order to
realize competing states, far beyond those practical for first-principles
methods. Here, we show how allowing non-integer nuclear charges expands the
space of computationally tractable electron systems that host competing
electronic states. The emergence of competing electronic states from
non-integer nuclear charges is exemplified in the simple 2-electron H_{2}
molecule and used to examine the microscopic structure of doped quasi-1D
cuprate chains, showing how non-integer nuclear charges can open a window for
first-principles calculations of difficult many-electron phenomena.

					<dc:description>  In the real world, some of the most complex settings for learned agents
involve interaction with humans, who often exhibit suboptimal, unpredictable
behavior due to sophisticated biases. Agents that interact with people in such
settings end up influencing the actions that these people take. Our goal in
this work is to enable agents to leverage that influence to improve the human's
performance in collaborative tasks, as the task unfolds. Unlike prior work, we
do not assume online training with people (which tends to be too expensive and
unsafe), nor access to a high fidelity simulator of the environment. Our idea
is that by taking a variety of previously observed human-human interaction data
and labeling it with the task reward, offline reinforcement learning (RL) can
learn to combine components of behavior, and uncover actions that lead to more
desirable human actions. First, we show that offline RL can learn strategies to
influence and improve human behavior, despite those strategies not appearing in
the dataset, by utilizing components of diverse, suboptimal interactions. In
addition, we demonstrate that offline RL can learn influence that adapts with
humans, thus achieving long-term coordination with them even when their
behavior changes. We evaluate our proposed method with real people in the
Overcooked collaborative benchmark domain, and demonstrate successful
improvement in human performance.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of drone-assisted collaborative learning is
considered. In this scenario, swarm of intelligent wireless devices train a
shared neural network (NN) model with the help of a drone. Using its sensors,
each device records samples from its environment to gather a local dataset for
training. The training data is severely heterogeneous as various devices have
different amount of data and sensor noise level. The intelligent devices
iteratively train the NN on their local datasets and exchange the model
parameters with the drone for aggregation. For this system, the convergence
rate of collaborative learning is derived while considering data heterogeneity,
sensor noise levels, and communication errors, then, the drone trajectory that
maximizes the final accuracy of the trained NN is obtained. The proposed
trajectory optimization approach is aware of both the devices data
characteristics (i.e., local dataset size and noise level) and their wireless
channel conditions, and significantly improves the convergence rate and final
accuracy in comparison with baselines that only consider data characteristics
or channel conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed
approach achieves an average 3.85% and 3.54% improvement in the final accuracy
of the trained NN on benchmark datasets for image recognition and semantic
segmentation tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework achieves a
significant speedup in training, leading to an average 24% and 87% saving in
the drone hovering time, communication overhead, and battery usage,
respectively for these tasks.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous car racing is a challenging task, as it requires precise
applications of control while the vehicle is operating at cornering speeds.
Traditional autonomous pipelines require accurate pre-mapping, localization,
and planning which make the task computationally expensive and
environment-dependent. Recent works propose use of imitation and reinforcement
learning to train end-to-end deep neural networks and have shown promising
results for high-speed racing. However, the end-to-end models may be dangerous
to be deployed on real systems, as the neural networks are treated as black-box
models devoid of any provable safety guarantees. In this work we propose a
decoupled approach where an optimal end-to-end controller and a state
prediction end-to-end model are learned together, and the predicted state of
the vehicle is used to formulate a control barrier function for safeguarding
the vehicle to stay within lane boundaries. We validate our algorithm both on a
high-fidelity Carla driving simulator and a 1/10-scale RC car on a real track.
The evaluation results suggest that using an explicit safety controller helps
to learn the task safely with fewer iterations and makes it possible to safely
navigate the vehicle on the track along the more challenging racing line.

					<dc:description>  Microservice-based systems are often complex to understand, especially when
their sizes grow. Abstracted views help practitioners with the system
understanding from a certain perspective. Recent advancement in interactive
data visualization begs the question of whether established software
engineering models to visualize system design remain the most suited approach
for the service-oriented design of microservices. Our recent work proposed
presenting a 3D visualization for microservices in augmented reality. This
paper analyzes whether such an approach brings any benefits to practitioners
when dealing with selected architectural questions related to system design
quality. For this purpose, we conducted a controlled experiment involving 20
participants investigating their performance in identifying service dependency,
service cardinality, and bottlenecks. Results show that the 3D enables novices
to perform as well as experts in the detection of service dependencies,
especially in large systems, while no differences are reported for the
identification of service cardinality and bottlenecks. We recommend industry
and researchers to further investigate AR for microservice architectural
analysis, especially to ease the onboarding of new developers in
microservice~projects.

					<dc:description>  Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has been the defining mobile
communications technology in recent generations. With the ever-increasing
demands looming towards 6G, we are in need of additional degrees of freedom
that deliver further gains beyond MIMO. To this goal, fluid antenna system
(FAS) has emerged as a new way to obtain spatial diversity using reconfigurable
position-switchable antennas. Considering the case with more than one ports
activated on a 2D fluid antenna surface at both ends, we take the
information-theoretic approach to study the achievable performance limits of
the MIMO-FAS. First, we propose a suboptimal scheme, referred to as QR
MIMO-FAS, to maximize the rate via joint port selection, transmit and receive
beamforming and power allocation. We then derive the optimal diversity and
multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of MIMO-FAS. From the DMT, we highlight that
MIMO-FAS outperforms traditional MIMO systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new
performance metric, namely $q$-outage capacity, which can jointly consider rate
and outage probability. Through this metric, our results indicate that MIMO-FAS
surpasses traditional MIMO greatly.

					<dc:description>  The most scalable proposed methods of simulating lattice fermions on noisy
quantum computers employ encodings that eliminate nonlocal operators using a
constant factor more qubits and a nontrivial stabilizer group. In this work, we
investigated the most straightforward error mitigation strategy using the
stabilizer group, stabilizer postselection, that is very natural to the setting
of fermionic quantum simulation. We numerically investigate the performance of
the error mitigation strategy on a range of systems containing up to 42 qubits
and on a number of fundamental quantum simulation tasks including
non-equilibrium dynamics and variational ground state calculations. We find
that at reasonable noise rates and system sizes, the fidelity of computations
can be increased significantly beyond what can be achieved with the standard
Jordan-Wigner transformation at the cost of increasing the number of shots by
less than a factor of 10, potentially providing a meaningful boost to near-term
quantum simulations. Our simulations are enabled by new classical simulation
algorithms that scale with the logical Hilbert space dimension rather than the
physical Hilbert space dimension.

					<dc:description>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning figuring out how
agents take actions in an unknown environment to maximize its rewards. Unlike
classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which agent has full knowledge of
its state, rewards, and transitional probability, reinforcement learning
utilizes exploration and exploitation for the model uncertainty. Under the
condition that the model usually has a large state space, a neural network (NN)
can be used to correlate its input state to its output actions to maximize the
agent's rewards. However, building and training an efficient neural network is
challenging. Inspired by Double Q-learning and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, we will propose and implement an improved version
of Double A3C algorithm which utilizing the strength of both algorithms to play
OpenAI Gym Atari 2600 games to beat its benchmarks for our project.

construct static scene 3D. We gathered a dataset which allows us to jointly
consider semantics, geometry, and physics and thus enables us to reconstruct

					<dc:title>Learning Label Encodings for Deep Regression</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Deep regression networks are widely used to tackle the problem of predicting
a continuous value for a given input. Task-specialized approaches for training
regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches,
such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on
regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown
significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings
for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to
find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces
Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire
network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling
regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label
encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous
search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization
function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These
properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits
against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in
lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL
results in 10.9% and 12.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct
regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors
and is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks. Code is
available at https://github.com/ubc-aamodt-group/RLEL_regression.

					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Spectral Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Proofs of localization for random Schr\&quot;odinger operators with sufficiently
regular distribution of the potential can take advantage of the fractional
moment method introduced by Aizenman-Molchanov, or use the classical Wegner
estimate as part of another method, e.g. the multi-scale analysis introduced by
Fr\&quot;ohlich-Spencer and significantly developed by Klein and his collaborators.
When the potential distribution is singular, most proofs rely crucially on
exponential estimates of events corresponding to finite truncations of the
operator in question; these estimates in some sense substitute for the
classical Wegner estimate. We introduce a method to &quot;lift&quot; such estimates,
which have been obtained for many stationary models, to certain closely related
non-stationary models. As an application, we use this method to derive Anderson
localization on the 1-D lattice for certain non-stationary potentials along the
lines of the non-perturbative approach developed by Jitomirskaya-Zhu in 2019.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we consider a ``reverse-engineering'' approach to construct
confining potentials that support exact, constant density kovaton solutions to
the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) also known as the nonlinear
Schr\&quot;odinger equation (NLSE). In the one-dimensional case, the exact solution
is the sum of stationary kink and anti-kink solutions, i.e. a kovaton, and in
the overlapping region, the density is constant. In higher dimensions, the
exact solutions are generalizations of this wave function. In the absence of
self-interactions, the confining potential is similar to a smoothed out finite
square well with minima also at the edges. When self-interactions are added, a
term proportional to $\pm g \psi^{\ast}\psi$ gets added to the confining
potential and $\pm g M$, where $M$ is the norm, gets added to the total energy.
In the realm of stability analysis, we find (linearly) stable solutions in the
case with repulsive self-interactions which also are stable to self-similar
deformations. For attractive interactions, however, the minima at the edges of
the potential get deeper and a barrier in the center forms as we increase the
norm. This leads to instabilities at a critical value of $M$ (related to the
number of particles in the BEC). Comparing the stability criteria from
Derrick's theorem and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis stability results, we find
that both predict stability for repulsive self-interactions and instability at
a critical mass $M$ for attractive interactions. However, the numerical
analysis gives a much lower critical mass. The numerical analysis shows further
that the initial instabilities violate the symmetry $x\rightarrow-x$ assumed by
Derrick's theorem.

					<dc:description>  We provide an intuitive understanding of the collective low-energy spin
excitation of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain,
known as the spinon. To this end, we demonstrate that a single spinon can be
excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state wave function of the
Heisenberg chain with an even number of sites. This procedure accurately
reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion, and provides a natural
explanation for its spin-1/2. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be
approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest
valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional
Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a
valence-bond solid.

					<dc:description>  We present the development of SpeCamX, a mobile application that transforms
any unmodified smartphone into a powerful multispectral imager capable of
capturing multispectral information. Our application includes an augmented
bilirubinometer, enabling accurate prediction of blood bilirubin levels (BBL).
In a clinical study involving 320 patients with liver diseases, we used SpeCamX
to image the bulbar conjunctiva region, and we employed a hybrid machine
learning prediction model to predict BBL. We observed a high correlation with
blood test results, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Furthermore, we
compared our method, which uses spectrally augmented learning (SAL), with
traditional learning based on RGB photographs (RGBL), and our results clearly
indicate that SpeCamX outperforms RGBL in terms of prediction accuracy,
efficiency, and stability. This study highlights the potential of SpeCamX to
improve the prediction of bio-chromophores, and its ability to transform an
ordinary smartphone into a powerful medical tool without the need for
additional investments or expertise. This makes it suitable for widespread use,
particularly in areas where medical resources are scarce.

					<dc:description>  Despite Federated Learning (FL)'s trend for learning machine learning models
in a distributed manner, it is susceptible to performance drops when training
on heterogeneous data. Recently, dataset distillation has been explored in
order to improve the efficiency and scalability of FL by creating a smaller,
synthetic dataset that retains the performance of a model trained on the local
private datasets. We discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify
the heterogeneity issue in FL. To address this, we propose a new method, called
Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation
(FEDLGD), which trains FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as
virtual data) created through a combination of local and global distillation.
Specifically, to handle synchronization and class imbalance, we propose
iterative distribution matching to allow clients to have the same amount of
balanced local virtual data; to harmonize the domain shifts, we use federated
gradient matching to distill global virtual data that are shared with clients
without hindering data privacy to rectify heterogeneous local training via
enforcing local-global feature similarity. We experiment on both benchmark and
real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from different sources. Our
method outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL algorithms under the
setting with a very limited amount of distilled virtual data.

					<dc:description>  The understanding of the mechanisms for the production of weakly bound
clusters, such as a deuteron $d$, in heavy-ion reactions at mid-rapidity is
presently one of the challenging problems which is also known as the &quot;ice in a
fire&quot; puzzle. In this study we investigate the dynamical formation of deuterons
within the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic
transport approach and advance two microscopic production mechanisms to
describe deuterons in heavy-ion collisions from SIS to RHIC energies: kinetic
production by hadronic reactions and potential production by the attractive
potential between nucleons. Differently to other studies, for the &quot;kinetic&quot;
deuterons we employ the full isospin decomposition of the various $\pi
NN\leftrightarrow \pi d$, $NNN\leftrightarrow N d$ channels and take into
account the finite size properties of the deuteron by means of an excluded
volume condition in coordinate space and by the projection onto the deuteron
wave function in momentum space. We find that considering the quantum nature of
the deuteron in coordinate and momentum space reduces substantially the kinetic
deuteron production in a dense medium as encountered in heavy-ion collisions.
If we add the &quot;potential&quot; deuterons by applying an advanced Minimum Spanning
Tree (aMST) procedure, we obtain good agreement with the available experimental
data from SIS energies up to the top RHIC energy.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A vast number of applications for legged robots entail tasks in complex,
dynamic environments. But these environments put legged robots at high risk for
limb damage. This paper presents an empirical study of fault tolerant dynamic
gaits designed for a quadrupedal robot suffering from a single, known
``missing'' limb. Preliminary data suggests that the featured gait controller
successfully anchors a previously developed planar monopedal hopping template
in the three-legged spatial machine. This compositional approach offers a
useful and generalizable guide to the development of a wider range of tripedal
recovery gaits for damaged quadrupedal machines.

					<dc:description>  We propose a level proximal subdifferential for a proper lower semicontinuous
function. Level proximal subdifferential is a uniform refinement of the
well-known proximal subdifferential, and has the pleasant feature that its
resolvent always coincides with the proximal mapping of a function. It turns
out that the resolvent representation of proximal mapping in terms of
Mordukhovich limiting subdifferential is only valid for hypoconvex functions.
We also provide properties of level proximal subdifferential and numerous
examples to illustrate our results.

					<dc:description>  Maximum bipartite matching is a fundamental algorithmic problem which can be
solved in polynomial time. We consider a natural variant in which there is a
separation constraint: the vertices on one side lie on a path or a grid, and
two vertices that are close to each other are not allowed to be matched
simultaneously. We show that the problem is hard to approximate even for paths,
and provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for both paths and grids.

					<dc:description>  Fixed-point (FXP) inference has proven suitable for embedded devices with
limited computational resources, and yet model training is continually
performed in floating-point (FLP). FXP training has not been fully explored and
the non-trivial conversion from FLP to FXP presents unavoidable performance
drop. We propose a novel method to train and obtain FXP convolutional
keyword-spotting (KWS) models. We combine our methodology with two
quantization-aware-training (QAT) techniques - squashed weight distribution and
absolute cosine regularization for model parameters, and propose techniques for
extending QAT over transient variables, otherwise neglected by previous
paradigms. Experimental results on the Google Speech Commands v2 dataset show
that we can reduce model precision up to 4-bit with no loss in accuracy.
Furthermore, on an in-house KWS dataset, we show that our 8-bit FXP-QAT models
have a 4-6% improvement in relative false discovery rate at fixed false reject
rate compared to full precision FLP models. During inference we argue that
FXP-QAT eliminates q-format normalization and enables the use of low-bit
accumulators while maximizing SIMD throughput to reduce user perceived latency.
We demonstrate that we can reduce execution time by 68% without compromising
KWS model's predictive performance or requiring model architectural changes.
Our work provides novel findings that aid future research in this area and
enable accurate and efficient models.

					<dc:description>  Soft robotic snakes (SRSs) have a unique combination of continuous and
compliant properties that allow them to imitate the complex movements of
biological snakes. Despite the previous attempts to develop SRSs, many have
been limited to planar movements or use wheels to achieve locomotion, which
restricts their ability to imitate the full range of biological snake
movements. We propose a new design for the SRSs that is wheelless and powered
by pneumatics, relying solely on spatial bending to achieve its movements. We
derive a kinematic model of the proposed SRS and utilize it to achieve two
snake locomotion trajectories, namely sidewinding and helical rolling. These
movements are experimentally evaluated under different gait parameters on our
SRS prototype. The results demonstrate that the SRS can successfully mimic the
proposed spatial locomotion trajectories. This is a significant improvement
over the previous designs, which were either limited to planar movements or
relied on wheels for locomotion. The ability of the SRS to effectively mimic
the complex movements of biological snakes opens up new possibilities for its
use in various applications.

					<dc:description>  This article studies the reliability of multi-hop routing in a multi-tier
hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN). We evaluate the reliability
of multi-hop routing by introducing interruption probability, which is the
probability that no relay device (ground gateway or satellite) is available
during a hop. The single-hop interruption probability is derived and extended
to the multi-hop interruption probability using a stochastic geometry-based
approach. Since the interruption probability in HSTRN highly depends on the
priority of selecting communication devices at different tiers, we propose
three priority strategies: (i) stationary optimal priority strategy, (ii)
single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy, and (iii) density
inspired strategy. Among them, the interruption probability under the
stationary optimal priority strategy can approach the ideal lower bound.
However, when analyzing an HSTRN with a large number of tiers, the stationary
optimal priority strategy is computationally expensive. The single-hop
interruption probability inspired strategy is expected to be a low-complexity
but less reliable alternative to the stationary optimal priority strategy. In
numerical results, we study the complementarity between terrestrial devices and
satellites. Furthermore, analytical results for reliability are also applicable
to the analysis of satellite availability, coverage probability, and
ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) rate. Finally, we extend
our original routing strategy into a multi-flow one with dynamic priority
strategy.

					<dc:description>  The inspection of the Public Right of Way (PROW) for accessibility barriers
is necessary for monitoring and maintaining the built environment for
communities' walkability, rollability, safety, active transportation, and
sustainability. However, an inspection of the PROW, by surveyors or crowds, is
laborious, inconsistent, costly, and unscalable. The core of smart city
developments involves the application of information technologies toward
municipal assets assessment and management. Sidewalks, in comparison to
automobile roads, have not been regularly integrated into information systems
to optimize or inform civic services. We develop an Open Automated Sidewalks
Inspection System (OASIS), a free and open-source automated mapping system, to
extract sidewalk network data using mobile physical devices. OASIS leverages
advances in neural networks, image sensing, location-based methods, and compact
hardware to perform sidewalk segmentation and mapping along with the
identification of barriers to generate a GIS pedestrian transportation layer
that is available for routing as well as analytic and operational reports. We
describe a prototype system trained and tested with imagery collected in
real-world settings, alongside human surveyors who are part of the local
transit pathway review team. Pilots show promising precision and recall for
path mapping (0.94, 0.98 respectively). Moreover, surveyor teams' functional
efficiency increased in the field. By design, OASIS takes adoption aspects into
consideration to ensure the system could be easily integrated with governmental
pathway review teams' workflows, and that the outcome data would be
interoperable with public data commons.

					<dc:title>Central BH mass of tidal disruption event candidate SDSS J0159 through

					<dc:description>  In this manuscript, central BH mass is determined in the tidal disruption
event (TDE) candidate SDSS J0159, through the nine years long variabilities, in
order to check whether the virial BH mass is consistent with the mass estimated
by another independent methods. First, host galaxy spectroscopic features are
described by 350 simple stellar templates, to confirm the total stellar mass
about $7\times10^{10}{\rm M_\odot}$ in SDSS J0159, indicating the virial BH
mass about two magnitudes larger than the BH mass estimated by the total
stellar mass. Second, based on an efficient method and fitting procedure,
through theoretical TDE model applied to describe the SDSS $ugriz$-band light
curves of SDSS J0159, central BH mass can be determined as
$M_{BH}\sim4.5_{-1.1}^{+1.3}\times10^6{\rm M_\odot}$, well consistent with the
M-sigma relation expected BH mass and the total stellar mass expected BH mass.
Third, the theoretical TDE model with parameter of central BH mass limited to
be higher than $10^8{\rm M_\odot}$ can not lead to reasonable descriptions to
the light curves of SDSS J0159, indicating central BH mass higher than
$10^8{\rm M_\odot}$ is not preferred in SDSS J0159. Therefore, the TDE model
determined central BH mass of SDSS J0159 are about two magnitudes lower than
the virial BH mass, to support central BLRs including accreting debris
contributions from central TDE, and provide interesting clues to reconfirm that
outliers in the space of virial BH mass versus stellar velocity dispersion
should be better candidates of TDE.

					<dc:description>  Due to the increasing challenges posed by the relentless rise in the design
complexity of integrated circuits, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) has emerged as
a robust alternative to structural APTG techniques. However, the high cost of
transforming a circuit testing problem to a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
limits the application of SAT in industrial ATPG scenarios, resulting in a loss
of test coverage. In Order to address this problem, this paper proposes a
conflict-driven structural learning (CDSL) ATPG algorithm firstly, in which the
conflict-driven heuristic methods in modern SAT solver are implemented on the
logic cone of fault propagation and activation directly. The proposed CDSL
algorithm is composed of three parts: (1) According to the implication graph,
various conflict constraints have been learned to prune search space. (2)
Conflict-driven implication and justification have been applied to increase
decision accuracy and solving efficiency. (3) A conflict-based diagnosis method
is further proposed in the case of low coverage debug, leading to making the
aborted faults testable by relaxing or modifying some constraints on primary
inputs. Extensive experimental results on industrial circuits demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDSL algorithm. It is shown that
compared with the SAT-based ATPG, the proposed CDSL can on average decrease
$25.6\%$ aborted faults with $94.51\%$ less run time. With a two-stage
computational flow, it has shown that the proposed CDSL can lead to $46.37\%$
less aborted faults than a one-stage structural algorithm, further with the
$3.19\%$ improvement on fault coverage. In addition, the conflict diagnosis can
lead to $8.89\%$ less aborted faults on average, and $0.271\%$ improvement in
fault coverage rate.

					<dc:description>  Soft robotic snakes made of compliant materials can continuously deform their
bodies and, therefore, mimic the biological snakes' flexible and agile
locomotion gaits better than their rigid-bodied counterparts. Without wheel
support, to date, soft robotic snakes are limited to emulating planar
locomotion gaits, which are derived via kinematic modeling and tested on
robotic prototypes. Given that the snake locomotion results from the reaction
forces due to the distributed contact between their skin and the ground, it is
essential to investigate the locomotion gaits through efficient dynamic models
capable of accommodating distributed contact forces. We present a complete
spatial dynamic model that utilizes a floating-base kinematic model with
distributed contact dynamics for a pneumatically powered soft robotic snake. We
numerically evaluate the feasibility of the planar and spatial rolling gaits
utilizing the proposed model and experimentally validate the corresponding
locomotion gait trajectories on a soft robotic snake prototype. We
qualitatively and quantitatively compare the numerical and experimental results
which confirm the validity of the proposed dynamic model.

					<dc:description>  In this work, the calculation of Casimir forces across thin DNA films is
carried out based on the Lifshitz theory. The variations of Casimir forces due
to the DNA thicknesses, volume fractions of containing water, covering media
and substrates are investigated. For a DNA film suspended in the air or water,
the Casimir force is attractive, and its magnitude increases with decreasing
the thickness of DNA films and the water volume fraction. For DNA films
deposited on a dielectric(silica) substrate, the Casimir force is attractive
for the air environment. However, the Casimir force shows unusual features in a
water environment. Under specific conditions, switching signs of the Casimir
force from attractive to repulsive can be achieved by increasing the DNA-film
thickness. Finally, the Casimir force for DNA films deposited on a metallic
substrate are investigated. The Casimir force is dominant by the repulsive
interactions at a small DNA-film thickness for both the air and water
environment. In a water environment, the Casimir force turns out to be
attractive at a large DNA-film thickness, and a stable Casimir equilibrium can
be found. In addition to the adhesion stability, our finding could be
applicable to the problems of condensation and de-condensation of DNA, due to
the fluctuation-induced dispersion forces.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces innovative data-driven techniques for estimating the
noise distribution and KL divergence bound for distributionally robust optimal
control (DROC). The proposed approach addresses the limitation of traditional
DROC approaches that require known ambiguity sets for the noise distribution,
our approach can learn these distributions and bounds in real-world scenarios
where they may not be known a priori. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, a navigation problem involving a car-like robot under different noise
distributions is used as a numerical example. The results demonstrate that DROC
combined with the proposed data-driven approaches, what we call D3ROC, provide
robust and efficient control policies that outperform the traditional iterative
linear quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) control approach. Moreover, it shows the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in handling different noise
distributions. Overall, the proposed approach offers a promising solution to
real-world DROC problems where the noise distribution and KL divergence bounds
may not be known a priori, increasing the practicality and applicability of the
DROC framework.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we solve several reverse isoperimetric problems in the class of
$\lambda$-convex bodies, i.e., convex bodies whose curvature at each point of
their boundary is bounded below by some $\lambda &gt; 0$.
  We give an affirmative answer in $\mathbb{R}^3$ to a conjecture due to
Borisenko which states that the $\lambda$-convex lens, i.e., the intersection
of two balls of radius $1/\lambda$, is the unique minimizer of volume among all
$\lambda$-convex bodies of given surface area.
  Also, we prove a reverse inradius inequality: in model spaces of constant
curvature and arbitrary dimension, we show that the $\lambda$-convex lens
(properly defined in non-zero curvature spaces) has the smallest inscribed ball
among all $\lambda$-convex bodies of given surface area. This solves a
conjecture due to Bezdek on minimal inradius of isoperimetric ball-polyhedra in
$\mathbb{R}^n$.

					<dc:description>  The Fanaroff-Riley class II radio galaxy Cygnus A hosts jets which produce
radio emission, X-ray cavities, cocoon shocks, and X-ray hotspots where the jet
interacts with the ICM. Surrounding one hotspot is a peculiar &quot;hole&quot; feature
which appears as a deficit in X-ray emission. We use relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations of a collimated jet interacting with an inclined interface between
lobe and cluster plasma to model the basic processes which may lead to such a
feature. We find that the jet reflects off of the interface into a broad,
turbulent flow back out into the lobe, which is dominated by gas stripped from
the interface at first and from the intracluster medium itself at later times.
We produce simple models of X-ray emission from the ICM, the hotspot, and the
reflected jet to show that a hole of emission surrounding the hotspot as seen
in Cygnus A may be produced by Doppler de-boosting of the emission from the
reflected jet as seen by an observer with a sight line nearly along the axis of
the outgoing material.

					<dc:description>  Sequential recommendations aim to capture users' preferences from their
historical interactions so as to predict the next item that they will interact
with. Sequential recommendation methods usually assume that all items in a
user's historical interactions reflect her/his preferences and transition
patterns between items. However, real-world interaction data is imperfect in
that (i) users might erroneously click on items, i.e., so-called misclicks on
irrelevant items, and (ii) users might miss items, i.e., unexposed relevant
items due to inaccurate recommendations. To tackle the two issues listed above,
we propose STEAM, a Self-correcTing sEquentiAl recoMmender. STEAM first
corrects an input item sequence by adjusting the misclicked and/or missed
items. It then uses the corrected item sequence to train a recommender and make
the next item prediction.We design an item-wise corrector that can adaptively
select one type of operation for each item in the sequence. The operation types
are 'keep', 'delete' and 'insert.' In order to train the item-wise corrector
without requiring additional labeling, we design two self-supervised learning
mechanisms: (i) deletion correction (i.e., deleting randomly inserted items),
and (ii) insertion correction (i.e., predicting randomly deleted items). We
integrate the corrector with the recommender by sharing the encoder and by
training them jointly. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that STEAM outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential recommendation baselines. Our in-depth analyses
confirm that STEAM benefits from learning to correct the raw item sequences.

					<dc:description>  A device called qubit energy tuner (QET) based on single flux quantum (SFQ)
circuits is proposed for Z control of superconducting qubits. Created from the
improvement of flux digital-to-analog converters (flux DACs), a QET is able to
set the energy levels or the frequencies of qubits, especially flux-tunable
transmons, and perform gate operations requiring Z control. The circuit
structure of QET is elucidated, which consists of an inductor loop and flux
bias units for coarse tuning or fine tuning. The key feature of a QET is
analyzed to understand how SFQ pulses change the inductor loop current, which
provides external flux for qubits. To verify the functionality of the QET,
three simulations are carried out. The first one verifies the responses of the
inductor loop current to SFQ pulses. The results show that there is about 4.2%
relative deviation between analytical solutions of the inductor loop current
and the solutions from WRSpice time-domain simulation. The second and the third
simulations with QuTip show how a Z gate and an iSWAP gate can be performed by
this QET, respectively, with corresponding fidelities 99.99884% and 99.93906%
for only once gate operation to specific initial states. These simulations
indicate that the SFQ-based QET could act as an efficient component of
SFQ-based quantum-classical interfaces for digital Z control of large-scale
superconducting quantum computers.

					<dc:description>  Quantum algorithmics with single spins poses serious technological challenges
such as precision fabrication, rapid decoherence, atomic-scale addressing and
readout. To circumvent atomic-scale challenges, we examine the case of fully
polarized mesoscopic spin ensembles (spin-coherent states) whose total angular
momenta states map to qudit submanifolds. We show that in the limit where the
size of the ensembles is small compared to their separation, it is possible to
treat them as qubits with an effective coupling strength that scales with the
number of spins. If the spins within each ensemble are decoupled (e.g., via
control fields, spinning or diffusional averaging or materials engineering),
one- and two-qubit gate operations can be implemented with high fidelities.

					<dc:description>  The Kirchberg Embedding Problem (KEP) asks if every C*-algebra embeds into an
ultrapower of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. In an effort to provide a
negative solution to the KEP and motivated by the recent refutation of the
Connes Embedding Problem, we establish two computability-theoretic consequences
of a positive solution to KEP. Both of our results follow from the a priori
weaker assumption that there exists a locally universal C*-algebra with a
computable presentation.

					<dc:description>  Many research efforts have been committed to unsupervised domain adaptation
(DA) problems that transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to
an unlabeled target domain. Various DA methods have achieved remarkable results
recently in terms of predicting ability, which implies the effectiveness of the
aforementioned knowledge transferring. However, state-of-the-art methods rarely
probe deeper into the transferred mechanism, leaving the true essence of such
knowledge obscure. Recognizing its importance in the adaptation process, we
propose an interpretive model of unsupervised domain adaptation, as the first
attempt to visually unveil the mystery of transferred knowledge. Adapting the
existing concept of the prototype from visual image interpretation to the DA
task, our model similarly extracts shared information from the domain-invariant
representations as prototype vectors. Furthermore, we extend the current
prototype method with our novel prediction calibration and knowledge fidelity
preservation modules, to orientate the learned prototypes to the actual
transferred knowledge. By visualizing these prototypes, our method not only
provides an intuitive explanation for the base model's predictions but also
unveils transfer knowledge by matching the image patches with the same
semantics across both source and target domains. Comprehensive experiments and
in-depth explorations demonstrate the efficacy of our method in understanding
the transferred mechanism and its potential in downstream tasks including model
diagnosis.

					<dc:description>  Coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are key tasks in modeling the
complex dynamics of many physical processes. Recently, neural operators have
shown the ability to solve PDEs by learning the integral kernel directly in
Fourier/Wavelet space, so the difficulty for solving the coupled PDEs depends
on dealing with the coupled mappings between the functions. Towards this end,
we propose a \textit{coupled multiwavelets neural operator} (CMWNO) learning
scheme by decoupling the coupled integral kernels during the multiwavelet
decomposition and reconstruction procedures in the Wavelet space. The proposed
model achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to previous
learning-based solvers in solving the coupled PDEs including Gray-Scott (GS)
equations and the non-local mean field game (MFG) problem. According to our
experimental results, the proposed model exhibits a $2\times \sim 4\times$
improvement relative $L$2 error compared to the best results from the
state-of-the-art models.

					<dc:description>  Ab-initio and continuum model studies predicted that the $\Gamma$ valley
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers could simulate the
conventional multi-orbital Hubbard model on the moir\'e Honeycomb lattice.
Here, we perform the Wannierization starting from the continuum model and show
that a more general Kanamori-Moir\'e-Hubbard model emerges, beyond the
extensively studied standard multi-orbital Hubbard model, which can be used to
investigate the many-body physics in the $\Gamma$ valley TMD homobilayers.
Using the unrestricted Hartree-Fock and Lanczos techniques, we study these
half-filled multi-orbital moir\'e bands. By constructing the phase diagrams we
predict the presence of an antiferromagnetic state and in addition we found
unexepected and dominant states, such as a S = 1 ferromagnetic insulator and a
charge density wave state. Our theoretical predictions made using this model
can be tested in future experiments on the $\Gamma$ valley TMD homobilayers.

					<dc:description>  With the increasing proportion of renewable energy in the generation side, it
becomes more difficult to accurately predict the power generation and adapt to
the large deviations between the optimal dispatch scheme and the day-ahead
scheduling in the process of real-time dispatch. Therefore, it is necessary to
conduct look-ahead dispatches to revise the operation plan according to the
real-time status of the power grid and reliable ultra-short-term prediction.
Application of traditional model-driven methods is often limited by the scale
of the power system and cannot meet the computational time requirements of
real-time dispatch. Data-driven methods can provide strong online
decision-making support abilities when facing large-scale systems, while it is
limited by the quantity and quality of the training dataset. This paper
proposes a model-informed reinforcement learning approach for look-ahead AC
optimal power flow. The reinforcement learning model is first formulated based
on the domain knowledge of economic dispatch, and then the physics-informed
neural network is constructed to enhance the reliability and efficiency. At
last, the case study based on the SG 126-bus system validates the accuracy and
efficiency of the proposed approach.

					<dc:description>  Localized channel modeling is crucial for offline performance optimization of
5G cellular networks, but the existing channel models are for general scenarios
and do not capture local geographical structures. In this paper, we propose a
novel physics-based and data-driven localized statistical channel modeling
(LSCM), which is capable of sensing the physical geographical structures of the
targeted cellular environment. The proposed channel modeling solely relies on
the reference signal receiving power (RSRP) of the user equipment, unlike the
traditional methods which use full channel impulse response matrices. The key
is to build the relationship between the RSRP and the channel's angular power
spectrum. Based on it, we formulate the task of channel modeling as a sparse
recovery problem where the non-zero entries of the sparse vector indicate the
channel paths' powers and angles of departure. A computationally efficient
weighted non-negative orthogonal matching pursuit (WNOMP) algorithm is devised
for solving the formulated problem. Finally, experiments based on synthetic and
real RSRP measurements are presented to examine the performance of the proposed
method.

					<dc:description>  When the traffic stream is extremely congested and surrounding vehicles are
not cooperative, the mandatory lane changing can be significantly difficult. In
this work, we propose an interactive trajectory planner, which will firstly
attempt to change lanes as long as safety is ensured. Based on receding horizon
planning, the ego vehicle can abort or continue changing lanes according to
surrounding vehicles' reactions. We demonstrate the performance of our planner
in extensive simulations with eight surrounding vehicles, initial velocity
ranging from 0.5 to 5 meters per second, and bumper to bumper gap ranging from
4 to 10 meters. The ego vehicle with our planner can change lanes safely and
smoothly. The computation time of the planner at every step is within 10
milliseconds in most cases on a laptop with 1.8GHz Intel Core i7-10610U.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural network (DNN) models for retinopathy have estimated predictive
accuracies in the mid-to-high 90%. However, the following aspects remain
unaddressed: State-of-the-art models are complex and require substantial
computational infrastructure to train and deploy; The reliability of
predictions can vary widely. In this paper, we focus on these aspects and
propose a form of iterative knowledge distillation(IKD), called IKD+ that
incorporates a tradeoff between size, accuracy and reliability. We investigate
the functioning of IKD+ using two widely used techniques for estimating model
calibration (Platt-scaling and temperature-scaling), using the best-performing
model available, which is an ensemble of EfficientNets with approximately 100M
parameters. We demonstrate that IKD+ equipped with temperature-scaling results
in models that show up to approximately 500-fold decreases in the number of
parameters than the original ensemble without a significant loss in accuracy.
In addition, calibration scores (reliability) for the IKD+ models are as good
as or better than the base mode

					<dc:description>  Accurately monitoring road traffic state and speed is crucial for various
applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic
safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state
data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making.
This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using
Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation
re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into
an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the propagation of traffic waves
in traffic flow data. This method can be applied to impute traffic state data
from fixed sensors or probe vehicles. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides
statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it
more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows
for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate
our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation
(NGSIM) and HighD programs. Considering current and future mixed traffic of
connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with
the traffic state estimation scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories,
mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment.
Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
estimation accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

					<dc:description>  Occasional energetic outbursts and anomalous X-ray luminosities are expected
to be powered by the strong magnetic field in a neutron star. For a very strong
magnetic field, elastic deformation becomes excessively large such that it
leads to crustal failure. We studied the evolutionary process driven by the
Hall drift for a magnetic field confined inside the crust. Assuming that the
elastic force acts against the Lorentz force, we examined the duration of the
elastic regime and maximum elastic energy stored before the critical state. The
breakup time was longer than that required for extending the field to the
exterior, because the tangential components of the Lorentz force vanished in
the fragile surface region. The conversion of large magnetic energy, confined
to the interior, into Joule heat is considered to explain the power for central
compact objects. This process can function without reaching its elastic limit,
unless the magnetic energy exceeds $2\times 10^{47}$ erg, which requires an
average field strength of $2\times10^{15}$ G. Thus, the strong magnetic field
hidden in the crust is unlikely to cause outbursts. Furthermore, the magnetic
field configuration can discriminate between central compact objects and
magnetars.

					<dc:description>  We determine the primitive ideal space and hence the ideal lattice of a large

A key ingredient is the notion of harmonious families of bisections in etale
groupoids associated to finite families of commuting local homeomorphisms. Our
results unify and recover all known results on ideal structure for crossed
products of commutative C*-algebras by free abelian groups, for graph
C*-algebras, and for Katsura's topological graph C*-algebras.

					<dc:description>  Recently, virtual/pseudo-point-based 3D object detection that seamlessly
fuses RGB images and LiDAR data by depth completion has gained great attention.
However, virtual points generated from an image are very dense, introducing a
huge amount of redundant computation during detection. Meanwhile, noises
brought by inaccurate depth completion significantly degrade detection
precision. This paper proposes a fast yet effective backbone, termed
VirConvNet, based on a new operator VirConv (Virtual Sparse Convolution), for
virtual-point-based 3D object detection. VirConv consists of two key designs:
(1) StVD (Stochastic Voxel Discard) and (2) NRConv (Noise-Resistant Submanifold
Convolution). StVD alleviates the computation problem by discarding large
amounts of nearby redundant voxels. NRConv tackles the noise problem by
encoding voxel features in both 2D image and 3D LiDAR space. By integrating
VirConv, we first develop an efficient pipeline VirConv-L based on an early
fusion design. Then, we build a high-precision pipeline VirConv-T based on a
transformed refinement scheme. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised pipeline
VirConv-S based on a pseudo-label framework. On the KITTI car 3D detection test
leaderboard, our VirConv-L achieves 85% AP with a fast running speed of 56ms.
Our VirConv-T and VirConv-S attains a high-precision of 86.3% and 87.2% AP, and
currently rank 2nd and 1st, respectively. The code is available at
https://github.com/hailanyi/VirConv.

					<dc:description>  Fast moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are well suited for aerial
surveillance, but are limited by their battery capacity. To increase their
endurance UAVs can be refueled on slow moving unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).
The cooperative routing of UAV-UGV to survey vast regions within their speed
and fuel constraints is a computationally challenging problem, but can be
simplified with heuristics. Here we present multiple heuristics to enable
feasible and sufficiently optimal solutions to the problem. Using the UAV fuel
limits and the minimum set cover algorithm, the UGV refueling stops are
determined. These refueling stops enable the allocation of mission points to
the UAV and UGV. A standard traveling salesman formulation and a vehicle
routing formulation with time windows, dropped visits, and capacity constraints
is used to solve for the UGV and UAV route, respectively. Experimental
validation of the approach on a small-scale testbed shows the efficacy of the
approach.

					<dc:description>  Jacobi algebras, as the algebraic counterparts of Jacobi manifolds, are
exactly the unital relative Poisson algebras. The direct approach of
constructing Frobenius Jacobi algebras in terms of Manin triples is not
available due to the existence of the units, and hence alternatively we replace
it by studying Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras. Such structures are
equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely, relative Poisson
bialgebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the
relative Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (RPYBE). Antisymmetric solutions of the
RPYBE give coboundary relative Poisson bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal
O$-operators of relative Poisson algebras and relative pre-Poisson algebras are
introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPYBE. A direct application
is that relative Poisson bialgebras can be used to construct Frobenius Jacobi
algebras, and in particular, there is a construction of Frobenius Jacobi
algebras from relative pre-Poisson algebras.

					<dc:description>  We study the binomial option pricing model and the Black-Scholes-Merton
pricing model. In the binomial option pricing model, we concentrate on two
widely-used call options: (1) European and (2) American. Under the
Black-Scholes-Merton model, we investigate pricing American put options. Our
contributions are two-fold: First, we transform the option pricing problems
into nonlinear stencil computation problems and present efficient algorithms to
solve them. Second, using our new FFT-based nonlinear stencil algorithms, we
improve the work and span asymptotically for the option pricing problems we
consider. In particular, we perform $O(T\log^2 T)$ work for both American call
and put option pricing, where $T$ is the number of time steps.

					<dc:description>  Ensuring fairness in anomaly detection models has received much attention
recently as many anomaly detection applications involve human beings. However,
existing fair anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on association-based
fairness notions. In this work, we target counterfactual fairness, which is a
prevalent causation-based fairness notion. The goal of counterfactually fair
anomaly detection is to ensure that the detection outcome of an individual in
the factual world is the same as that in the counterfactual world where the
individual had belonged to a different group. To this end, we propose a
counterfactually fair anomaly detection (CFAD) framework which consists of two
phases, counterfactual data generation and fair anomaly detection. Experimental
results on a synthetic dataset and two real datasets show that CFAD can
effectively detect anomalies as well as ensure counterfactual fairness.

					<dc:description>  Understanding pedestrian dynamics and the interaction of pedestrians with
their environment is crucial to the safe and comfortable design of pedestrian
facilities. Experiments offer the opportunity to explore the influence of
individual factors. In the context of the project CroMa (Crowd Management in
transport infrastructures), experiments were conducted with about 1000
participants to test various physical and social psychological hypotheses
focusing on people's behaviour at railway stations and crowd management
measures. The following experiments were performed: i) Train Platform
Experiment, ii) Crowd Management Experiment, iii) Single-File Experiment, iv)
Personal Space Experiment, v) Boarding and Alighting Experiment, vi) Bottleneck
Experiment and vii) Tiny Box Experiment. This paper describes the basic
planning and implementation steps, outlines all experiments with parameters,
geometries, applied sensor technologies and pre- and post-processing steps. All
data can be found in the pedestrian dynamics data archive.

					<dc:description>  Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized
treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as
finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include
large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising
significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment
effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased
treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular,
anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high
variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular
samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In
this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural
controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable
solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly
model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes
with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given
by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.

					<dc:description>  Hand gesture-based human-computer interaction is an important problem that is
well explored using color camera data. In this work we proposed a hand gesture
detection system using thermal images. Our system is capable of handling
multiple hand regions in a frame and process it fast for real-time
applications. Our system performs a series of steps including background
subtraction-based hand mask generation, k-means based hand region
identification, hand segmentation to remove the forearm region, and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based gesture classification. Our work
introduces two novel algorithms, bubble growth and bubble search, for faster
hand segmentation. We collected a new thermal image data set with 10 gestures
and reported an end-to-end hand gesture recognition accuracy of 97%.

					<dc:description>  Neural network ensembles have been studied extensively in the context of
adversarial robustness and most ensemble-based approaches remain vulnerable to
adaptive attacks. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) ensembles through architectural
improvements and ensemble diversity promotion. We perform a comprehensive
robustness assessment against adaptive attacks and investigate the relationship
between ensemble diversity and robustness. Our results demonstrate the benefits
of ECOC ensembles for adversarial robustness compared to regular ensembles of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and show why the robustness of previous
implementations is limited. We also propose an adversarial training method
specific to ECOC ensembles that allows to further improve robustness to
adaptive attacks.

					<dc:description>  Inferring the full transportation network, including sidewalks and cycleways,
is crucial for many automated systems, including autonomous driving,
multi-modal navigation, trip planning, mobility simulations, and freight
management. Many transportation decisions can be informed based on an accurate
pedestrian network, its interactions, and connectivity with the road networks
of other modes of travel. A connected pedestrian path network is vital to
transportation activities, as sidewalks and crossings connect pedestrians to
other modes of transportation. However, information about these paths' location
and connectivity is often missing or inaccurate in city planning systems and
wayfinding applications, causing severe information gaps and errors for
planners and pedestrians. This work begins to address this problem at scale by
introducing a novel dataset of aerial satellite imagery, street map imagery,
and rasterized annotations of sidewalks, crossings, and corner bulbs in urban
cities. The dataset spans $2,700 km^2$ land area, covering select regions from
$6$ different cities. It can be used for various learning tasks related to
segmenting and understanding pedestrian environments. We also present an
end-to-end process for inferring a connected pedestrian path network map using
street network information and our proposed dataset. The process features the
use of a multi-input segmentation network trained on our dataset to predict
important classes in the pedestrian environment and then generate a connected
pedestrian path network. Our results demonstrate that the dataset is
sufficiently large to train common segmentation models yielding accurate,
robust pedestrian path networks.

					<dc:description>  The problem of detecting the presence of a signal that can lead to a disaster
is studied. A decision-maker collects data sequentially over time. At some
point in time, called the change point, the distribution of data changes. This
change in distribution could be due to an event or a sudden arrival of an enemy
object. If not detected quickly, this change has the potential to cause a major
disaster. In space and military applications, the values of the measurements
can stochastically grow with time as the enemy object moves closer to the
target. A new class of stochastic processes, called exploding processes, is
introduced to model stochastically growing data. An algorithm is proposed and
shown to be asymptotically optimal as the mean time to a false alarm goes to
infinity.

					<dc:description>  Recently, moir\'e engineering has been extensively employed for creating and
studying novel electronic materials in two dimensions. However, its application
in nanophotonic systems has not been widely explored so far. Here, we
demonstrate that twisted bilayer photonic crystals provide a new photonic
platform with twist-angle-tunable optical dispersion. Compared to twisted
two-dimensional materials, twisted bilayer photonic crystals host a rich set of
physics and provide a much larger number of degrees of freedom choice of
material, lattice symmetry, feature size, twist angle, and interlayer gap,
which promises an unprecedented toolbox for tailoring optical properties. We
directly visualize the dispersion throughout the optical frequency range and
show that the measured optical response is in good quantitative agreement with
numerical and analytical results. Our results reveal a highly tunable band
structure of twisted bilayer photonic crystals due to moir\'e scattering. This
work opens the door to exploring unconventional physics and novel applications
in photonics.

					<dc:description>  Paramagnetic ions and radicals play essential roles in biology and medicine,
but detecting these species requires a highly sensitive and ambient-operable
sensor. Optically addressable spin color centers in 3D semiconductors have been
used for detecting paramagnetic spins as they are sensitive to the spin
magnetic noise. However, the distance between spin color centers and target
spins is limited due to the difficulty of creating high-quality spin defects
near the surface of 3D materials. Here, we show that spin qubits in hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material, can serve as a
promising sensor for nanoscale detection of paramagnetic spins in liquids. We
first create shallow spin defects in close proximity to the hBN surface, which
sustain high-contrast optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in liquids.
Then we demonstrate sensing spin noise of paramagnetic ions in water based on
spin relaxation measurements. Finally, we show that paramagnetic ions can
reduce the contrast of spin-dependent fluorescence, enabling efficient
detection by continuous wave ODMR. Our results demonstrate the potential of
ultrathin hBN quantum sensors for chemical and biological applications.

					<dc:description>  Domain generalization (DG) is a principal task to evaluate the robustness of
computer vision models. Many previous studies have used normalization for DG.
In normalization, statistics and normalized features are regarded as style and
content, respectively. However, it has a content variation problem when
removing style because the boundary between content and style is unclear. This
study addresses this problem from the frequency domain perspective, where
amplitude and phase are considered as style and content, respectively. First,
we verify the quantitative phase variation of normalization through the
mathematical derivation of the Fourier transform formula. Then, based on this,
we propose a novel normalization method, PCNorm, which eliminates style only as
the preserving content through spectral decomposition. Furthermore, we propose
advanced PCNorm variants, CCNorm and SCNorm, which adjust the degrees of
variations in content and style, respectively. Thus, they can learn
domain-agnostic representations for DG. With the normalization methods, we
propose ResNet-variant models, DAC-P and DAC-SC, which are robust to the domain
gap. The proposed models outperform other recent DG methods. The DAC-SC
achieves an average state-of-the-art performance of 65.6% on five datasets:
PACS, VLCS, Office-Home, DomainNet, and TerraIncognita.

					<dc:description>  We have conducted a detailed high-pressure investigation on $Eu-$doped
$BaTiO_3$ using angle-resolved x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
dielectric permittivity and dc resistance measurements. The x-ray diffraction
data analysis shows a structural transition from the ambient tetragonal to the
mixed (cubic + tetragonal) phase above 1.4 GPa pressure. The tetragonality due
to the internal deformation of the $TiO_6$ octahedra caused by a charge
difference cannot be lifted upon by pressure. Softening, weakening, and
disappearance of low-frequency Raman modes indicate ferroelectric tetragonal to
the paraelectric cubic phase transition. But the pressure-induced increase in
the intensity of [E(LO), A1(LO)] and the octahedral breathing modes indicate
the local structural inhomogeneity remains in the crystal and is responsible
for spontaneous polarization in the sample. Low-frequency electronic scattering
response suggests the pressure-induced carrier delocalization, leading to a
metallic state in the system. We speculate the presence of localized
microscopic ferroelectric ordering in the system at high pressure from
dielectric constant and dc resistance measurements. Our results suggest
high-pressure phase coexistence leads to a ferroelectric-like metallic state in
the sample.

					<dc:description>  We report on the solar source of the 2022 February 3 geomagnetic storm of
moderate strength that contributed to the loss of 39 Starlink satellites. The
geomagnetic storm was caused by the 2022 January 29 halo coronal mass ejection
(CME) that was of moderate speed (about 690 km/s) originating from NOAA active
region 12936 located in the northeast quadrant (N18E06) of the Sun. The
eruption was marked by an M1.1 flare, which started at 22:45 UT, peaked at
23:32 UT on January 29 and ended at 00:24 UT the next day. The CME ended up as
a shock-driving magnetic cloud (MC) observed at Sun-Earth L1 and at
STEREO-Ahead (STA) located about 34 deg behind Earth. The geomagnetic storm was
caused by a strong southward component of the MC that was boosted by a high
speed solar wind stream behind the MC. Even though Earth and STA were separated
by only about 34 deg, the MC appeared quite different at Earth and L1. One
possibility is that the MC was writhed reflecting the curved neutral line at
the Sun. In-situ observations suggest that the MC was heading closer to STA
than to Earth because of the earlier arrival at STA. However, the shock arrived
at STA and Earth around the same time, suggesting a weaker shock at Earth due
to flank passage.

					<dc:description>  Token pruning has emerged as an effective solution to speed up the inference
of large Transformer models. However, prior work on accelerating Vision
Transformer (ViT) models requires training from scratch or fine-tuning with
additional parameters, which prevents a simple plug-and-play. To avoid high
training costs during the deployment stage, we present a fast training-free
compression framework enabled by (i) a dense feature extractor in the initial
layers; (ii) a sharpness-minimized model which is more compressible; and (iii)
a local-global token merger that can exploit spatial relationships at various
contexts. We applied our framework to various ViT and DeiT models and achieved
up to 2x reduction in FLOPS and 1.8x speedup in inference throughput with &lt;1%
accuracy loss, while saving two orders of magnitude shorter training times than
existing approaches. Code will be available at

					<dc:title>Controllable magnon-induced transparency in a ferromagnetic material via
  cross- and self-Kerr effects</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Munir, Akhtar</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Optics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Nonlinear interactions between optical fields and magnetic modes in cavity
magnonics constitute a rich source of various nontrivial effects in optics and
quantum information processing. In cavity magnonics, the nonlinear cross-Kerr
effect, which shifts the cavity's central frequency when a magnetic material is
pumped, causes the system to exhibit both Kittle and magnetostatic modes. Here,
we propose a new scheme for the investigation of probe fields transmission
profiles in cavity magnonic systems composed of a microwave cavity and a
ferromagnetic material (Yttrium iron garnet sphere). We report single-to-double
magnon-induced transparency (MIT) dips and a sharp magnon-induced absorption
(MIA) peak, and demonstrate how nonlinear cross- and self-Kerr interactions can
significantly enhance or suppress these phenomena. It is observed that the
splitting of the MIT window occurs when we incorporate magnon-magnon modes
coupling, which helps introducing a new degree of freedom to light-matter
interaction problems. Moreover, we investigate the propagation of group delay
in the vicinity of transparency and demonstrate how a sharp dip allows the
realization of slow light for a longer period of time. We found that both the
cavity-Kittle and magnon-magnon modes coupling parameters influence the
propagation of group delay, which demonstrates how subluminal-to-superluminal
(and vice versa) propagation phenomena may occur and transform. These findings
could pave the way for future research into nonlinear effects with novel
applications in cavity magnonics devices, which might be exploited for several
applications such as quantum computing devices and quantum memories.

					<dc:description>  Study patterns that models have learned has long been a focus of pattern
recognition research. Explaining what patterns are discovered from training
data, and how patterns are generalized to unseen data are instrumental to
understanding and advancing the pattern recognition methods. Unfortunately, the
vast majority of the application domains deal with continuous data (i.e.
statistical in nature) out of which extracted patterns can not be formally
defined. For example, in image classification, there does not exist a principle
definition for a label of cat or dog. Even in natural language, the meaning of
a word can vary with the context it is surrounded by. Unlike the aforementioned
data format, programs are a unique data structure with a well-defined syntax
and semantics, which creates a golden opportunity to formalize what models have
learned from source code. This paper presents the first formal definition of
patterns discovered by code summarization models (i.e. models that predict the
name of a method given its body), and gives a sound algorithm to infer a
context-free grammar (CFG) that formally describes the learned patterns.
  We realize our approach in PATIC which produces CFGs for summarizing the
patterns discovered by code summarization models. In particular, we pick two
prominent instances, code2vec and code2seq, to evaluate PATIC. PATIC shows that
the patterns extracted by each model are heavily restricted to local, and
syntactic code structures with little to none semantic implication. Based on
these findings, we present two example uses of the formal definition of
patterns: a new method for evaluating the robustness and a new technique for
improving the accuracy of code summarization models.
  Our work opens up this exciting, new direction of studying what models have
learned from source code.

					<dc:title>Reduced-Order Model Predictive Control of a Fish Schooling Model</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Ogura, Masaki</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Wakamiya, Naoki</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study the problem of model predictive control (MPC) for the fish schooling
model proposed by Gautrais et al. (Annales Zoologici Fennici, 2008). The high
nonlinearity of the model attributed to its attraction/alignment/repulsion law
suggests the need to use MPC for controlling the fish schooling's motion.
However, for large schools, the hybrid nature of the law can make it
numerically demanding to perform finite-horizon optimizations in MPC.
Therefore, this paper proposes reducing the fish schooling model for
numerically efficient MPC; the reduction is based on using the weighted average
of the directions of individual fish in the school. We analytically show how
using the normalized eigenvector centrality of the alignment-interaction
network can yield a better reduction by comparing reduction errors. We confirm
this finding on the weight and numerical efficiency of the MPC with the
reduced-order model by numerical simulations. The proposed reduction allows us
to control a school with up to 500 individuals. Further, we confirm that
reduction with the normalized eigenvector centrality allows us to improve the
control accuracy by factor of five when compared to that using constant
weights.

					<dc:description>  Shape change enables new capabilities for robots. One class of robots capable
of dramatic shape change is soft growing &quot;vine&quot; robots. These robots usually
feature global actuation methods for bending that limit them to simple,
constant-curvature shapes. Achieving more complex &quot;multi-bend&quot; configurations
has also been explored but requires choosing the desired configuration ahead of
time, exploiting contact with the environment to maintain previous bends, or
using pneumatic actuation for shape locking. In this paper, we present a novel
design that enables passive, on-demand shape locking. Our design leverages a
passive tip mount to apply hook-and-loop fasteners that hold bends without any
pneumatic or electrical input. We characterize the robot's kinematics and
ability to hold locked bends. We also experimentally evaluate the effect of
hook-and-loop fasteners on beam and joint stiffness. Finally, we demonstrate
our proof-of-concept prototype in 2D. Our passive shape locking design is a
step towards easily reconfigurable robots that are lightweight, low-cost, and
low-power.

					<dc:title>Photothermally-Induced Nonlinearity in a Quantum Multimode Optical
  System</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Munir, Akhtar</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Optics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Similar to radiation pressure, photothermal effects connect the optical path
length to an intracavity field, resulting in nonlinear behavior of the
resonator due to thermal effects. Here, we theoretically investigate the
nonlinear optics that emerge as a result of photothermal effects in a multimode
optical system composed of two cavity modes coupled via hopping coefficient and
with two mechanical modes through coupling rates. We report single to double
photothermally-induced transparency (PTIT) dips, and a single sharp
photothermally-induced absorption (PTIA) peak, and demonstrate that
photothermal and strong coupling coefficients can suppress this phenomenon.
Moreover, we observe Fano resonances in the absorption profile by monitoring
probe transmission in the off-resonant configuration of the transparency
phenomenon. The dynamics of group delay or advance are investigated in the
range of transparency such that a sharp dip can assist in achieving slow light
for a longer time. Using appropriate experimental parameters, our proposed work
can pave the way for future practical applications in quantum information
processing based on multimode interactions.

					<dc:description>  For a graph G = (V,E) where each vertex is coloured by one of k colours,
consider a subset C of V such that for each vertex v in V\C, its set of nearest
neighbours in C contains at least one vertex of the same colour as v. Such a C
is called a consistent subset (CS). Computing a consistent subset of the
minimum size is called the Minimum Consistent Subset problem (MCS). MCS is
known to be NP-complete for planar graphs. We propose a polynomial-time
algorithm for finding a minimum consistent subset of a k-chromatic spider graph
when k is a constant. We also show MCS remains NP-complete on trees.

					<dc:title>Dynamic Deep Learning LES Closures: Online Optimization With Embedded

					<dc:creator>Sirignano, Justin</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Physics - Fluid Dynamics</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as a candidate for closure modeling
of large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. High-fidelity training data
is typically limited: it is computationally costly (or even impossible) to
numerically generate at high Reynolds numbers, while experimental data is also
expensive to produce and might only include sparse/aggregate flow measurements.
Thus, only a relatively small number of geometries and physical regimes will
realistically be included in any training dataset. Limited data can lead to
overfitting and therefore inaccurate predictions for geometries and physical
regimes that are different from the training cases. We develop a new online
training method for deep learning closure models in LES which seeks to address
this challenge. The deep learning closure model is dynamically trained during a
large-eddy simulation (LES) calculation using embedded direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data. That is, in a small subset of the domain, the flow is
computed at DNS resolutions in concert with the LES prediction. The closure
model then adjusts its approximation to the unclosed terms using data from the
embedded DNS. Consequently, the closure model is trained on data from the exact
geometry/physical regime of the prediction at hand. An online optimization
algorithm is developed to dynamically train the deep learning closure model in
the coupled, LES-embedded DNS calculation.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a study on the integral equation method and the
Nyst\&quot;{o}m method for the scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a
two-layered medium with an unbounded perturbed boundary. The medium consists of
two layers separated by a plane interface, for which we assume transmission
boundary conditions. We assume either Dirichlet or impedance boundary
conditions for the rough surface boundary. Unlike classical rough surface
scattering problems, the presence of a plane interface makes it difficult to
establish the well-posedness of the scattering problem and to find a numerical
treatment. We introduce the two-layered Green function and prove that this
function has similar asymptotic decay properties to the half-space Green
function. By using a similar approach to classical rough surface problems, we
establish the uniqueness of the scattering problem. We derive the integral
equation formulations using the two-layered Green function as the integral
kernel and use them to prove the existence of the scattering problem.
Furthermore, we propose the Nyst\&quot;{o}m method for discretizing the integral
equations and establish its convergence. Finally, we perform numerical
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Nyst\&quot;{o}m method.

					<dc:description>  The ease of use of robot programming interfaces represents a barrier to robot
adoption in several manufacturing sectors because of the need for more
expertise from the end-users. Current robot programming methods are mostly the
past heritage, with robot programmers reluctant to adopt new programming
paradigms. This work aims to evaluate the impact on non-expert users of
introducing a new task-oriented programming interface that hides the complexity
of a programming framework based on ROS. The paper compares the programming
performance of such an interface with a classic robot-oriented programming
method based on a state-of-the-art robot teach pendant. An experimental
campaign involved 22 non-expert users working on the programming of two
industrial tasks. Task-oriented and robot-oriented programming showed
comparable learning time, programming time and the number of questions raised
during the programming phases, highlighting the possibility of a smooth
introduction to task-oriented programming even to non-expert users.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a robust approach for learning from noisy pairwise
comparisons. We propose sufficient conditions on the loss function under which
the risk minimization framework becomes robust to noise in the pairwise similar
dissimilar data. Our approach does not require the knowledge of noise rate in
the uniform noise case. In the case of conditional noise, the proposed method
depends on the noise rates. For such cases, we offer a provably correct
approach for estimating the noise rates. Thus, we propose an end-to-end
approach to learning robust classifiers in this setting. We experimentally show
that the proposed approach RoLNiP outperforms the robust state-of-the-art
methods for learning with noisy pairwise comparisons.

capable of performing experiential learning, exploiting a &quot;try and fail&quot;
approach relying on a swarm of subordinate agents executed in a virtual
environment to determine optimal strategies. The problem is treated as a
&quot;Narrow AGI&quot; problem with the scope of goals and environments bound to
financial markets, specifically crypto-markets. Such an agent is called an
&quot;adaptive multi-strategy agent&quot; as it executes multiple strategies virtually
and selects only a few for real execution. The presented version of the agent
is extended to solve portfolio optimization and re-balancing across multiple
assets so the problem of active portfolio management is being addressed. Also,
an attempt is made to apply an experiential learning approach executed in the
virtual environment of multi-agent simulation and backtesting based on
historical market data, so the agent can learn mappings between specific market
conditions and optimal strategies corresponding to these conditions.
Additionally, the agent is equipped with the capacity to predict price
movements based on social media data, which increases its financial
performance.

					<dc:description>  Invariant risk minimization (IRM) has received increasing attention as a way
to acquire environment-agnostic data representations and predictions, and as a
principled solution for preventing spurious correlations from being learned and
for improving models' out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, recent works
have found that the optimality of the originally-proposed IRM optimization
(IRM) may be compromised in practice or could be impossible to achieve in some
scenarios. Therefore, a series of advanced IRM algorithms have been developed
that show practical improvement over IRM. In this work, we revisit these recent
IRM advancements, and identify and resolve three practical limitations in IRM
training and evaluation. First, we find that the effect of batch size during
training has been chronically overlooked in previous studies, leaving room for
further improvement. We propose small-batch training and highlight the
improvements over a set of large-batch optimization techniques. Second, we find
that improper selection of evaluation environments could give a false sense of
invariance for IRM. To alleviate this effect, we leverage diversified test-time
environments to precisely characterize the invariance of IRM when applied in
practice. Third, we revisit (Ahuja et al. (2020))'s proposal to convert IRM
into an ensemble game and identify a limitation when a single invariant
predictor is desired instead of an ensemble of individual predictors. We
propose a new IRM variant to address this limitation based on a novel viewpoint
of ensemble IRM games as consensus-constrained bi-level optimization. Lastly,
we conduct extensive experiments (covering 7 existing IRM variants and 7
datasets) to justify the practical significance of revisiting IRM training and
evaluation in a principled manner.

					<dc:description>  Audio-Visual Video Parsing is a task to predict the events that occur in
video segments for each modality. It often performs in a weakly supervised
manner, where only video event labels are provided, i.e., the modalities and
the timestamps of the labels are unknown. Due to the lack of densely annotated
labels, recent work attempts to leverage pseudo labels to enrich the
supervision. A commonly used strategy is to generate pseudo labels by
categorizing the known event labels for each modality. However, the labels are
still limited to the video level, and the temporal boundaries of event
timestamps remain unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a new pseudo label
generation strategy that can explicitly assign labels to each video segment by
utilizing prior knowledge learned from the open world. Specifically, we exploit
the CLIP model to estimate the events in each video segment based on visual
modality to generate segment-level pseudo labels. A new loss function is
proposed to regularize these labels by taking into account their
category-richness and segmentrichness. A label denoising strategy is adopted to
improve the pseudo labels by flipping them whenever high forward binary cross
entropy loss occurs. We perform extensive experiments on the LLP dataset and
demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality segment-level pseudo
labels with the help of our newly proposed loss and the label denoising
strategy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio-visual video parsing
performance.

					<dc:description>  The energy demands for the growing development of society need to be catered
with alternative and green fuels like hydrogen energy for a lasting and
sustainable culture. One essential component of the hydrogen economy is the
efficiency of its storage. We have studied the hydrogen-storage capability on a
recently synthesized Biphenylene (BPh) decorated with Sc using the
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) techniques. Scandium attaches BPh sheet strongly with binding
energy -3.84 eV, and single Sc decorated on BPh can absorb a maximum of five
H$_2$ molecules resulting in a high gravimetric weight percentage of 11.07,
which is significantly higher than DoE's ultimate criteria (6.5 wt%). Using
van't Hoff equation, strongly and weakly attached hydrogens correspond to
desorption temperatures of 200 K and 397 K with an average of 305 K. The high
binding of Sc to BPh is due to charge donation of 3d orbital of Sc to 2p
orbital of C. The interactions between absorbed H$_2$ and BPh+Sc are due to
charge transfer from 3d-orbital of Sc to ${\sigma}$* bond of H$_2$ molecules
and backdonation from ${\sigma}$ bond of H$_2$ to empty 3d-orbital of Sc known
as Kubas type interaction. Furthermore, phonon and AIMD simulation confirm
BPh+Sc stability, and the presence of an energy barrier shows no probability of
Sc-Sc clustering on BPh. So theoretically stable BPh+Sc showing high
gravimetric weight percentage with an average 305 K desorption temperature,
might be a potential candidate for solidstage hydrogen devices.

					<dc:description>  Humans manipulate various kinds of fluids in their everyday life: creating
latte art, scooping floating objects from water, rolling an ice cream cone,
etc. Using robots to augment or replace human labors in these daily settings
remain as a challenging task due to the multifaceted complexities of fluids.
Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed
by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring). However,
the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in
terms of the fluid's complex material behaviors and multi-component
interactions, both of which were well beyond the scope of the current
literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and
interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform
with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In
this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set
of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address
interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the
heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine,
providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various
material types and their couplings. We identify several challenges for fluid
manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and
trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges,
we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with
differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling
optimization problems featured by fluid system's non-convex and non-smooth
properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasonable sim-to-real transfer by
deploying optimized trajectories in real-world settings.

					<dc:description>  A popular track of network compression approach is Quantization aware
Training (QAT), which accelerates the forward pass during the neural network
training and inference. However, not much prior efforts have been made to
quantize and accelerate the backward pass during training, even though that
contributes around half of the training time. This can be partly attributed to
the fact that errors of low-precision gradients during backward cannot be
amortized by the training objective as in the QAT setting. In this work, we
propose to solve this problem by incorporating the gradients into the
computation graph of the next training iteration via a hypernetwork. Various
experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset with different CNN network architectures
demonstrate that our hypernetwork-based approach can effectively reduce the
negative effect of gradient quantization noise and successfully quantizes the
gradients to INT4 with only 0.64 accuracy drop for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10.

					<dc:description>  This paper further explores our previous wake word spotting system ranked
2-nd in Track 1 of the MISP Challenge 2021. First, we investigate a robust
unimodal approach based on 3D and 2D convolution and adopt the simple attention
module (SimAM) for our system to improve performance. Second, we explore
different combinations of data augmentation methods for better performance.
Finally, we study the fusion strategies, including score-level, cascaded and
neural fusion. Our proposed multimodal system leverages multimodal features and
uses the complementary visual information to mitigate the performance
degradation of audio-only systems in complex acoustic scenarios. Our system
obtains a false reject rate of 2.15% and a false alarm rate of 3.44% in the
evaluation set of the competition database, which achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance by 21% relative improvement compared to previous
systems.

					<dc:description>  We first give two methods based on the representation theory of symmetric
groups to study the largest size $P(n,d)$ of permutation codes of length $n$
i.e. subsets of the set $S_n$ all permutations on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ with the
minimum distance (at least) $d$ under the Kendall $\tau$-metric. The first
method is an integer programming problem obtained from the transitive actions
of $S_n$. The second method can be applied to refute the existence of perfect
codes in $S_n$.\\ Here we reduce the known upper bound $(n-1)!-1$ for $P(n,3)$
to $(n-1)!-\lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil+2\leq (n-1)!-2$, whenever $n\geq 11$ is any
prime number. If $n=6$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $15$, $17$, the known upper
bound for $P(n,3)$ is decreased by $3,3,9,11,1,1,4$, respectively.

					<dc:description>  Production of electron-positron pairs in two oscillating strong electric
field pulses with largely different frequencies and durations is considered. In
a first scenario, the influence of a low-frequency background field on pair
production by a short main pulse of high frequency is analyzed. The background
field is shown to cause characteristic modifications of the momentum spectra of
created particles which, in turn, may be used for imaging of the background
pulse. In a second scenario, an ultrashort, relatively weak assisting pulse is
superimposed onto a strong main pulse. By studying the dependence of the pair
production on the field parameters it is shown that duration and relative
position of the ultrashort pulse modify the momentum spectra of produced
particles in a distinctive way. Both scenarios enable, moreover, to extract
partial information about the time periods when pairs with certain momenta are
produced predominantly.

					<dc:description>  All-$d$ Heuslers are a category of novel compounds combining versatile
functionalities such as caloric responses and spintronics with enhanced
mechanical properties. Despite the promising transport properties (anomalous
Hall (AHC) and anomalous Nernst (ANC) conductivities) shown in the conventional
Co$_2$XY Heuslers with $p$-$d$ hybridization, the all-$d$ Heuslers with only
$d$-$d$ hybridization open a new horizon to search for new candidates with
outstanding transport properties. In this work, we evaluate the AHC and ANC for
thermodynamically stable ferro/ferri-magnetic all-$d$-metal regular Heusler
compounds based on high-throughput first-principles calculations. It is
observed that quite a few materials exhibit giant AHCs and ANCs, such as cubic
Re$_2$TaMn with an AHC of 2011 S/cm, and tetragonal Pt$_2$CrRh with an AHC of
1966 S/cm and an ANC of 7.50 A/mK. Comprehensive analysis on the electronic
structure reveals that the high AHC can be attributed to the occurrence of the
Weyl nodes or gapped nodal lines in the neighbourhood of the Fermi level. The
correlations between such transport properties and the number of valence
electrons are also thoroughly investigated, which provides a practical guidance
to tailor AHC and ANC via chemical doping for transverse thermoelectric
applications.

					<dc:description>  We present and release in open source format a sparse linear solver which
efficiently exploits heterogeneous parallel computers. The solver can be easily
integrated into scientific applications that need to solve large and sparse
linear systems on modern parallel computers made of hybrid nodes hosting NVIDIA
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators.
  The work extends our previous efforts in the exploitation of a single GPU
accelerator and proposes an implementation, based on the hybrid MPI-CUDA
software environment, of a Krylov-type linear solver relying on an efficient
Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioner already available in the BootCMatchG
library. Our design for the hybrid implementation has been driven by the best
practices for minimizing data communication overhead when multiple GPUs are
employed, yet preserving the efficiency of the single GPU kernels. Strong and
weak scalability results on well-known benchmark test cases of the new version
of the library are discussed. Comparisons with the Nvidia AmgX solution show an
improvement of up to 2.0x in the solve phase.

					<dc:description>  High-resolution (HR) images are usually downscaled to low-resolution (LR)
ones for better display and afterward upscaled back to the original size to
recover details. Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and
upscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR
via invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social
media), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will
lead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse
upscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper,
we propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware
image rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an
end-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for
high-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical
analysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information
(including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and
propose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR
images in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize
the learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling
datasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under
standard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).

					<dc:description>  We prove that Kaletha's local Langlands correspondence for regular
supercuspidal representations gives the classical local Jacquet--Langlands
correspondence due to Deligne--Kazhdan--Vigneras and Badulescu. As in a former
joint paper with Oi, where a similar result is proved for the local Langlands
correspondence for the general linear group, the key ingredients in our proof
are the work of Bushnell--Henniart explicitly describing the local
Jacquet--Langlands correspondence for essentially tame supercuspidal
representations and its reinterpretation due to Tam in terms of
Langlands--Shelstad's \(\zeta\)-data. While, under suitable assumptions, this
result follows from more general theorems either in the recent work of
Fintzen--Kaletha--Spice or that of Chan--Oi, our proof does not require any
assumptions. We also complement a few points on the proof in the former paper
with Oi.

					<dc:description>  The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to start the Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) in early to mid-2025. This multi-band wide-field synoptic
survey will transform our view of the solar system, with the discovery and
monitoring of over 5 million small bodies.The final survey strategy chosen for
LSST has direct implications on the discoverability and characterization of
solar system minor planets and passing interstellar objects. Creating an
inventory of the solar system is one of the four main LSST science drivers. The
LSST observing cadence is a complex optimization problem that must balance the
priorities and needs of all the key LSST science areas.To design the best LSST
survey strategy, a series of operation simulations using the Rubin Observatory
scheduler have been generated to explore the various options for tuning
observing parameters and prioritizations. We explore the impact of the various
simulated LSST observing strategies on studying the solar system's small body
reservoirs. We examine what are the best observing scenarios and review what
are the important considerations for maximizing LSST solar system science. In
general, most of the LSST cadence simulations produce +/-5% or less variations
in our chosen key metrics, but a subset of the simulations significantly hinder
science returns with much larger losses in the discovery and light curve
metrics.

					<dc:title>Confinement Potential in a Soft-Wall Holographic Model with a

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It is well known that the Soft-Wall holographic model for QCD successfully
reproduces not only the linear Regge spectrum, but also, via the holographic
Wilson confinement criterion, the ''linear plus Coulomb'' confinement potential
similar to the Cornell potential. This property could be interpreted as a
holographic counterpart of the hadron string picture, where the linearly rising
potential and Regge-like spectrum are directly related. However, such a
relation does not take place in the bottom-up holographic approach. Namely, the
Cornell-like potentials arise in a broad class of bottom-up holographic models,
the standard Soft-Wall model is merely a particular representative of this
class. We consider a calculation of confinement potential within a different
representative of this class - a Soft-Wall model with linear dilaton background
in the metric. This model leads to a Hydrogen like spectrum. The calculation of
renormalized potential at short distances turns out to be complicated by a new
subtlety that was skipped in general discussions of the issue existing in the
literature. But the confinement potential of the model is shown to be not very
different from the potential obtained in the standard Soft-Wall model with
quadratic background.

					<dc:description>  Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is promising, however has been shown to be
sub-optimal, with inferior transfer performance across low-resource languages.
In this work, we envision languages as domains for improving zero-shot transfer
by jointly reducing the feature incongruity between the source and the target
language and increasing the generalization capabilities of pre-trained
multilingual transformers. We show that our approach, DiTTO, significantly
outperforms the standard zero-shot fine-tuning method on multiple datasets
across all languages using solely unlabeled instances in the target language.
Empirical results show that jointly reducing feature incongruity for multiple
target languages is vital for successful cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, our
model enables better cross-lingual transfer than standard fine-tuning methods,
even in the few-shot setting.

					<dc:description>  Considering $\sin\,\theta_{12}=1/\sqrt{3}$ and

proposed in the light of normal ordering of neutrino masses. The texture
accommodates only three real independent parameters, which predict the rest six
observational parameters. It rules out any possibility of a vanishing

form is realised in the framework of $SU(2)_L \otimes A_4$ symmetry through
type-I seesaw mechanism.

					<dc:description>  Motivated by the recent measurement of muon anomalous magnetic moment at
Fermilab, the rapid progress of the LHC search for supersymmetry, and the
significantly improved sensitivities of dark matter direct detection
experiments, we studied their impacts on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM). We conclude that higgsino mass should be larger than about
$500~{\rm GeV}$ for $M_1 &lt; 0 $ and $630~{\rm GeV}$ for $M_1 &gt; 100~{\rm GeV}$,
where $M_1$ denotes the bino mass. These improved bounds imply a tuning of
${\cal{O}}(1\%)$ to predict the $Z$-boson mass and simultaneously worsen the
naturalness of the $Z$- and $h$-mediated resonant annihilations to achieve the
measured dark matter density. We also concluded that the LHC restrictions have
set lower bounds on the sparticle mass spectra: $ m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \gtrsim
210~{\rm GeV}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm} \gtrsim 235~{\rm
GeV}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_3^0} \gtrsim 515~{\rm GeV}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_4^0}
\gtrsim 525~{\rm GeV}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^\pm} \gtrsim 530~{\rm GeV}$,
$m_{\tilde{\nu}_\mu} \gtrsim 235~{\rm GeV}$, $ m_{\tilde{\mu}_1} \gtrsim
215~{\rm GeV}$, and $m_{\tilde{\mu}_2} \gtrsim 250~{\rm GeV}$, where
$\tilde{\chi}_{2}^0$ and $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ are wino-dominated when they are
lighter than about $500~{\rm GeV}$. These bounds are far beyond the reach of
the LEP experiments in searching for supersymmetry and have not been acquired
before. In addition, we illuminate how some parameter spaces of the MSSM have
been tested at the LHC and provide five scenarios in which the theory coincides
with the LHC restrictions. Once the muon g-2 anomaly is confirmed to originate
from supersymmetry, this research may serve as a guide to explore the
characteristics of the MSSM in future experiments.

					<dc:description>  The Secretary problem is a classical sequential decision-making question that
can be succinctly described as follows: a set of rank-ordered applicants are
interviewed sequentially for a single position. Once an applicant is
interviewed, an immediate and irrevocable decision is made if the person is to
be offered the job or not and only applicants observed so far can be used in
the decision process. The problem of interest is to identify the stopping rule
that maximizes the probability of hiring the highest-ranked applicant. A
multiple-choice version of the Secretary problem, known as the Dowry problem,
assumes that one is given a fixed integer budget for the total number of
selections allowed to choose the best applicant. It has been solved using tools
from dynamic programming and optimal stopping theory. We provide the first
combinatorial proof for a related new \emph{query-based model} for which we are
allowed to solicit the response of an expert to determine if an applicant is
optimal. Since the selection criteria differ from those of the Dowry problem we
obtain nonidentical expected stopping times.
  Our result indicates that an optimal strategy is the $(a_s, a_{s-1}, \ldots,
a_1)$-strategy, i.e., for the $i^{th}$ selection, where $1 \le i \le s$ and $1
\le j = s+1-i \le s$, we reject the first $a_j$ applicants, wait until the
decision of the $(i-1)^{th}$ selection (if $i \ge 2$), and then accept the next
applicant whose qualification is better than all previously appeared
applicants. Furthermore, our optimal strategy is right-hand based, i.e., the
optimal strategies for two models with $s_1$ and $s_2$ selections in total
($s_1 &lt; s_2$) share the same sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{s_1}$ when it is
viewed from the right. When the total number of applicants tends to infinity,
our result agrees with the thresholds obtained by Gilbert and Mosteller.

					<dc:description>  We describe a new approach for classifying conjugacy classes of elementary
abelian subgroups in simple algebraic groups over an algebraically closed
field, and understanding the normaliser and centraliser structure of these. For
toral subgroups, we give an effective classification algorithm. For non-toral
elementary abelian subgroups, we focus on algebraic groups of exceptional type
with a view to future applications, and in this case we provide tables
explicitly describing the subgroups and their local structure. We then describe
how to transfer results to the corresponding finite groups of Lie type using
the Lang-Steinberg Theorem; this will be used in forthcoming work to complete
the classification of elementary abelian $p$-subgroups for torsion primes $p$
in finite groups of exceptional Lie type. Such classification results are
important for determining the maximal $p$-local subgroups and $p$-radical
subgroups, both of which play a crucial role in modular representation theory.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the convergence of the nonsymmetric interior penalty
Galerkin (NIPG) method on a Bakhvalov-type mesh for the first time. For this
purpose, a new composite interpolation is designed, which solves the inherent
difficulty of analysis on Bakhvalov-type meshes. More specifically, Gauss Radau
interpolation and Gauss Lobatto interpolation are used outside and inside the
layer, respectively. On the basis of that, by choosing the specific values of
the penalty parameters at different mesh points, we derive the supercloseness
of $k+1/2$th order ($k\ge 1$), and prove the convergence of optimal order in an
energy norm. The theoretical conclusion is consistent with the numerical
results.

					<dc:title>Resilient Strong Structural Controllability in Networks using Leaky
  Forcing in Graphs</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Abbas, Waseem</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of selecting input nodes (leaders) to make
networks strong structurally controllable despite misbehaving nodes and edges.
We utilize a graph-based characterization of network strong structural
controllability (SSC) in terms of zero forcing in graphs, which is a dynamic
coloring of nodes. We consider three types of misbehaving nodes and edges that
disrupt the zero forcing process in graphs, thus, deteriorating the network
SSC. Then, we examine a leader selection guaranteeing network SSC by ensuring
the accuracy of the zero forcing process, despite $k$ misbehaving nodes/edges.
Our main result shows that a network is resilient to $k$ misbehaving
nodes/edges under one threat model if and only if it is resilient to the same
number of failures under the other threat models. Thus, resilience against one
threat model implies resilience against the other models. We then discuss the

					<dc:description>  Two regimes permitting safe physical human-robot interaction, speed and
separation monitoring and safety-rated monitored stop, depend on reliable
perception of the space surrounding the robot. This can be accomplished by
visual sensors (like cameras, RGB-D cameras, LIDARs), proximity sensors, or
dedicated devices used in industrial settings like pads that are activated by
the presence of the operator. The deployment of a particular solution is often
ad hoc and no unified representation of the interaction space or its coverage
by the different sensors exists. In this work, we make first steps in this
direction by defining the spaces to be monitored, representing all sensor data
as information about occupancy and using occupancy-based metrics to calculate
how a particular sensor covers the workspace. We demonstrate our approach in
two (multi-)sensor-placement experiments in three static scenes and one
experiment in a dynamic scene. The occupancy representation allow to compare
the effectiveness of various sensor setups. Therefore, this approach can serve
as a prototyping tool to establish the sensor setup that provides the most
efficient coverage for the given metrics and sensor representations.

					<dc:description>  Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) is one of most competitive photovoltaic materials
for its earth-abundant reserves, environmental friendliness, and high
stability.The quality of CZTSSe absorber determines the power-conversion
efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells. The absorber's quality lies on
post-selenization process, which is the reaction of Cu-Zn-Sn precursor and
selenium vapor. And the post-selenization is dependent on various factors (e.g.
temperature, precursor composition, reaction atmosphere, etc).However,
synergistic regulation of these factors cannot be realized under a widely-used
single-temperature zone selenization condition.Here, in our dual-temperature
zone selenization scheme, a solid-liquid and solid-gas (solid precursor and
liquid/gas phase Se) synergistic reaction strategy has been developed to
precisely regulate the selenization. Pre-deposited excess liquid Se provides
high Se chemical potential to drive a direct and fast formation of the CZTSSe
phase, significantly reducing the amount of binary and ternary compounds within
phase evolution. And organics removal can be accomplished via a synergistic
optimization of Se condensation and subsequent volatilization. We achieve a
high-performance CZTSSe solar cell with a remarkable PCE of 13.6%, and the
highest large-area PCE of 12.0% (over 1cm2). Our strategy will provide a new
idea for further improving efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells via phase evolution
regulation, and also for other complicated multi-compound synthesis.

					<dc:description>  We prove a number of geometric and topological properties of the moduli space
$\mathcal{D}(n)$ of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes for any $n \geq 2$. Using
the Delzant correspondence this allows us to answer several questions, posed in
the past decade by a number of authors, concerning the moduli space
$\mathcal{M}(n)$ of symplectic toric manifolds of dimension $2n$. Two
highlights of the paper are the construction of examples showing that, in
contrast with the work of Oda in dimension $4$, no classification of minimal
models of symplectic toric manifolds should be expected in higher dimension,
and a proof that the space of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes is
path-connected, which was previously shown for $n=2$ by the first author,
Pires, Ratiu and Sabatini in 2014, who made use of the classification of
minimal models in this case. Our proof of path connectedness for $n\geq2$ is
algorithmic and based on the fact that every rational fan can be refined to a
unimodular fan, a standard result used for resolution of singularities in toric
varieties.

					<dc:description>  Visual place recognition is a key to unlocking spatial navigation for
animals, humans and robots. From a biological perspective, research in
neuroscience has shown that place recognition ability presupposes abstracting
mental representations of places so that they can generalize to unseen
conditions. Inspired by that, we investigate learning features that are
insensitive to appearance modifications while sensitive to geometric
transformations in a self-supervised manner. That dual-purpose training is made
possible by combining the two self-supervision main paradigms, \textit{i.e.}
contrastive and predictive learning. Our results on standard benchmarks reveal
that jointly learning such appearance-invariant and geometry-equivariant image
descriptors leads to competitive visual place recognition results across
adverse seasonal and illumination conditions, without requiring any
human-annotated labels

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Dynamical Systems</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this study, we analyze the bioconvection in a suspension of phototactic
algae that exhibits anisotropic scattering. The top layer of the suspension is
illuminated by oblique collimated irradiation. During the study, the bottom
boundary is considered as rigid whereas the top boundary is considered
stress-free. In order to solve the eigenvalue problem, the
Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich finite difference method of order four is used.
Linear analysis of the basic state is performed using neutral curves. The
results demonstrate a change in the most unstable mode from an overstable to a
stationary state or vice versa for particular parameters in response to a
variation in the incidence angle. The position of the maximum basic
concentration shifts toward the top of the suspension as the incidence angle is
increased. In most cases, the system becomes more unstable with an increment in
the incidence angle.

Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson and Thomassen~[J. Graph Theory {\bf 14} (1990),

recently, Ito and Tsuchiya~[J. Graph Theory {\bf 99} (2022), 162--170] found a

refine these results in a sense, and extend the first one to a spanning tree
without stems of small degree.

					<dc:creator>Reid, M. D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Drummond, P. D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We analyze a quantum measurement $\hat{x}$ by solving the dynamics of
stochastic amplitudes that propagate both forward and backward in the time
direction. The dynamics is derived from quantum mechanics: The instantaneous
joint density of amplitudes $x$ and $p$ is proved equivalent to the positive
$Q(x,p,t)$ phase-space distribution, which establishes causal consistency. We
model the measurement $\hat{x}$ as amplification, confirming Born's rule for a
system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates $|x_{j}\rangle$ of $\hat{x}$.
The trajectories for the backward-propagating variable $x$ are governed by a
future boundary condition determined by the measurement setting, as though the
system were prepared in a mixture of $|x_{j}\rangle$. Causal relations are
deduced from the simulations. For superpositions and entangled states, we
identify causal loops for variables that are not observable. A hybrid causal
structure exists that is consistent with macroscopic realism. Further, the
model allows forward-backward simulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell
correlations, which addresses a question raised by Schr\&quot;odinger. The
simulations reveal consistency with a weak form of local realism defined for
the system after the unitary interactions determining the measurement settings,
the Bell violations emerging due to a breakdown of a subset of Bell's
local-realism conditions. Our results elucidate how hidden causal loops can
explain Bell nonlocality, without requiring retrocausality at a macroscopic
level.

					<dc:description>  Many in the US were reluctant to report their COVID-19 cases at the height of
the pandemic (e.g., for fear of missing work or other obligations due to
quarantine mandates). Other methods such as using public social media data can
therefore help augment current approaches to surveilling pandemics. This study
evaluated the effectiveness of using social media data as a data source for
tracking public health pandemics. There have been several attempts at using
social media data from platforms like Twitter for analyzing the COVID-19
pandemic. While these provide a multitude of useful insights, new platforms
like Venmo, a popular U.S. mobile social payment app often used during
in-person activities, remain understudied. We developed unique computational
methods (combining Venmo- and Facebook- derived data) to classify post content,
including the location where the content was likely posted. This approach
enabled geotemporal COVID-19-related infoveillance. By examining 135M publicly
available Venmo transactions from 22.1M unique users, we found significant
spikes in the use of COVID-19 related keywords in March 2020. Using
Facebook-based geotags for 9K users along with transaction geo-parsing (i.e.,
parsing text to detect place names), we identified 38K location-based clusters.
Within these groups, we found a strong correlation (0.81) between the use of
COVID-19 keywords in a region and the number of reported COVID-19 cases as well
as an aggregate decrease in transactions during lockdowns and an increase when
lockdowns are lifted. Surprisingly, we saw a weak negative correlation between
the number of transactions and reported cases over time (-0.49). Our results
indicate that using non-Twitter social media trace data can aid pandemic- and
other health-related infoveillance.

					<dc:description>  This paper studies implicit surface reconstruction leveraging differentiable
ray casting. Previous works such as IDR and NeuS overlook the spatial context
in 3D space when predicting and rendering the surface, thereby may fail to
capture sharp local topologies such as small holes and structures. To mitigate
the limitation, we propose a flexible neural implicit representation leveraging
hierarchical voxel grids, namely Neural Deformable Anchor (NeuDA), for
high-fidelity surface reconstruction. NeuDA maintains the hierarchical anchor
grids where each vertex stores a 3D position (or anchor) instead of the direct
embedding (or feature). We optimize the anchor grids such that different local
geometry structures can be adaptively encoded. Besides, we dig into the
frequency encoding strategies and introduce a simple hierarchical positional
encoding method for the hierarchical anchor structure to flexibly exploit the
properties of high-frequency and low-frequency geometry and appearance.
Experiments on both the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate that NeuDA can
produce promising mesh surfaces.

					<dc:description>  Catalysts used in quantum resource theories need not be in isolation and
therefore are possibly correlated with external systems, which the agent does
not have access to. Do such correlations help or hinder catalysis, and does the
classicality or quantumness of such correlations matter? To answer this
question, we first focus on the existence of a non-invasively measurable
observable that yields the same outcomes for repeated measurements, since this
signifies macro-realism, a key property distinguishing classical systems from
quantum systems. We show that a system quantumly correlated with an external
system so that the joint state is necessarily perturbed by any repeatable
quantum measurement, also has the same property against general quantum
channels. Our full characterization of such systems called totally quantum
systems, solves the open problem of characterizing tomographically sensitive
systems raised in [Lie and Jeong, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 020802 (2023)]. An
immediate consequence is that a totally quantum system cannot catalyze any
quantum process, even when a measure of correlation with its environment is
arbitrarily low. It generalizes to a stronger result, that the mutual
information of totally quantum systems cannot be used as a catalyst either.
These results culminate in the conclusion that, out of the correlations that a
generic quantum catalyst has with its environment, only classical correlations
allow for catalysis, and therefore using a correlated catalyst is equivalent to
using an ensemble of uncorrelated catalysts.

					<dc:description>  Uncertainty quantification has been extensively used as a means to achieve
efficient directed exploration in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However,
state-of-the-art methods for continuous actions still suffer from high sample
complexity requirements. Indeed, they either completely lack strategies for
propagating the epistemic uncertainty throughout the updates, or they mix it
with aleatoric uncertainty while learning the full return distribution (e.g.,
distributional RL). In this paper, we propose Wasserstein Actor-Critic (WAC),
an actor-critic architecture inspired by the recent Wasserstein Q-Learning
(WQL) \citep{wql}, that employs approximate Q-posteriors to represent the
epistemic uncertainty and Wasserstein barycenters for uncertainty propagation
across the state-action space. WAC enforces exploration in a principled way by
guiding the policy learning process with the optimization of an upper bound of
the Q-value estimates. Furthermore, we study some peculiar issues that arise
when using function approximation, coupled with the uncertainty estimation, and
propose a regularized loss for the uncertainty estimation. Finally, we evaluate
our algorithm on standard MujoCo tasks as well as suite of continuous-actions
domains, where exploration is crucial, in comparison with state-of-the-art
baselines.

					<dc:description>  Linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations are performed in experimentally
relevant scenarios built from a MAST case where a microtearing mode instability
dominates at ion Larmor radius scale (these microtearing modes are only weakly
unstable and nonlinear simulations indicate they do not cause an experimentally
significant level of transport across the chosen surface). This collisional
microtearing mode instability appears only when a velocity dependent electron
collision frequency is considered. Electrostatic potential fluctuations are
found to provide a strong destabilising mechanism. The sensitivity to the
electron collision frequency is investigated in both linear and nonlinear
simulations. While the effect of electron collision frequency is moderate in
linear simulations, a strong dependence on this parameter is found in nonlinear
simulations. The effect of magnetic islands generated by microtearing modes and
their interaction is analysed, showing that the radial extension of the
stochastic region caused by islands overlapping plays an important role in
determining the saturation level of the microtearing mode driven heat flux.
Nonlinear simulations on the chosen surface find that the radial extend of the
stochastic region and the mocrotearing mode heat flux both increase with
decreasing electron collision frequency. The magnetic shear is found to play an
important role in the formation of a stochastic layer.

					<dc:description>  We consider a process of noncolliding $q$-exchangeable random walks on
$\mathbb{Z}$ making steps $0$ (straight) and $-1$ (down). A single random walk
is called $q$-exchangeable if under an elementary transposition of the
neighboring steps (down, straight) $\to$ (straight, down) the probability of
the trajectory is multiplied by a parameter $q\in(0,1)$. Our process of $m$
noncolliding $q$-exchangeable random walks is obtained from the independent
$q$-exchangeable walks via the Doob's $h$-transform for a certain nonnegative
eigenfunction $h$ with the eigenvalue less than $1$. The system of $m$ walks
evolves in the presence of an absorbing wall at $0$.
  We show that the trajectory of the noncolliding $q$-exchangeable walks
started from an arbitrary initial configuration forms a determinantal point
process, and express its kernel in a double contour integral form. This kernel
is obtained as a limit from the correlation kernel of $q$-distributed random
lozenge tilings of sawtooth polygons.
  In the limit as $m\to \infty$, $q=e^{-\gamma/m}$ with $\gamma&gt;0$ fixed, and
under a suitable scaling of the initial data, we obtain a limit shape of our
noncolliding walks and also show that their local statistics are governed by
the incomplete beta kernel. The latter is a distinguished translation invariant
ergodic extension of the two-dimensional discrete sine kernel.

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Quantum decoherence happens when the system interacts with the environment.
Quantum correlation behaviours in the two-qubit spin squeezing model are
studied under the influence of intrinsic decoherence. Quantitative results were
determined, which depend on parameters of the physical system by checking
different quantifiers of quantum correlation such as entanglement, local
quantum uncertainty, trace distance discord and uncertainty-induced quantum
nonlocality. We show that the entanglement suffers from intrinsic decoherence
and exhibits sudden death, whereas the other measures are more robust against
intrinsic decoherence. Further, we highlight the role of spin squeezing
coupling constant and magnetic field.

					<dc:description>  Despite the evident necessity of topological protection for realizing
scalable quantum computers, the conceptual underpinnings of topological quantum
logic gates had arguably remained shaky, both regarding their physical
realization as well as their information-theoretic nature.
  Building on recent results on defect branes in string/M-theory and on their
holographically dual anyonic defects in condensed matter theory, here we
explain how the specification of realistic topological quantum gates, operating
by anyon defect braiding in topologically ordered quantum materials, has a
surprisingly slick formulation in parameterized point-set topology, which is so
fundamental that it lends itself to certification in modern homotopically typed
programming languages, such as cubical Agda.
  We propose that this remarkable confluence of concepts may jointly kickstart
the development of topological quantum programming proper as well as of
real-world application of homotopy type theory, both of which have arguably
been falling behind their high expectations; in any case, it provides a
powerful paradigm for simulating and verifying topological quantum computing
architectures with high-level certification languages aware of the actual
physical principles of realistic topological quantum hardware.
  In a companion article, we will explain how further passage to &quot;dependent
linear&quot; homotopy data types naturally extends this scheme to a full-blown
quantum programming/certification language in which our topological quantum
gates may be compiled to verified quantum circuits, complete with quantum
measurement gates and classical control.

					<dc:description>  The discrete complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is a fundamental model for the
dynamics of nonlinear lattices incorporating competitive dissipation and energy
gain effects. Such mechanisms are of particular importance for the study of
survival/destruction of localised structures in many physical situations. In
this work, we prove that in the discrete complex Ginzburg-Landau equation
dissipative solitonic waveforms persist for significant times by introducing a
dynamical transitivity argument. This argument is based on a combination of the
notions of ``inviscid limits'' and of the ``continuous dependence of solutions
on their initial data'', between the dissipative system and its Hamiltonian
counterparts. Thereby, it establishes closeness of the solutions of the
Ginzburg-Landau lattice to those of the conservative ideals described by the
Discrete Nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger and Ablowitz-Ladik lattices. Such a closeness
holds when the initial conditions of the systems are chosen to be sufficiently
small in the suitable metrics and for small values of the dissipation or gain
strengths. Our numerical findings are in excellent agreement with the
analytical predictions for the dynamics of the dissipative bright, dark or even
Peregrine-type solitonic waveforms.

					<dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks provide state-of-the-art accuracy for vision tasks but
they require significant resources for training. Thus, they are trained on
cloud servers far from the edge devices that acquire the data. This issue
increases communication cost, runtime and privacy concerns. In this study, a
novel hierarchical training method for deep neural networks is proposed that
reduces the communication cost, training runtime, and privacy concerns by
dividing the architecture between edge and cloud workers using early exits. The
method proposes a brand-new use case for early exits to separate the backward
pass of neural networks between the edge and the cloud during the training
phase. We address the issues of most available hierarchical training methods
that due to the sequential nature of the training phase, cannot train the
levels of hierarchy at the same time or they do it with the cost of privacy. In
contrast to these schemes, our method can use both edge and cloud workers
simultaneously, does not share the raw input data with the cloud, and does not
require communication during the backward pass. Several simulations and
on-device experiments for different neural network architectures are done to
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. It is shown that the method
reduces 29% and 61% runtime in CIFAR-10 classification experiment for VGG-16
and ResNet-18 when the communication with the cloud is done over the 3G
protocol. This gain in the runtime is achieved whilst the accuracy drop is
negligible. This method can be inspirational to provide online learning of
high-accuracy deep neural networks on low-resource devices such as mobile
phones or robots as a part of an edge-cloud system, making them more flexible
in facing new tasks and classes of data in the future.

					<dc:description>  Safety concerns during the operation of legged robots must be addressed to
enable their widespread use. Machine learning-based control methods that use
model-based constraints provide promising means to improve robot safety. This
study presents a modular safety filter to improve the safety of a legged robot,
i.e., reduce the chance of a fall. The prerequisite is the availability of a
robot that is capable of locomotion, i.e., a nominal controller exists. During
locomotion, terrain properties around the robot are estimated through machine
learning which uses a minimal set of proprioceptive signals. A novel
deep-learning model utilizing an efficient transformer architecture is used for
the terrain estimation. A quadratic program combines the terrain estimations
with inverse dynamics and a novel exponential control barrier function
constraint to filter and certify nominal control signals. The result is an
optimal controller that acts as a filter. The filtered control signal allows
safe locomotion of the robot. The resulting approach is generalizable, and
could be transferred with low effort to any other legged system.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Recently, a variety of methods under the name of non-contrastive learning
(like BYOL, SimSiam, SwAV, DINO) show that when equipped with some asymmetric
architectural designs, aligning positive pairs alone is sufficient to attain
good performance in self-supervised visual learning. Despite some
understandings of some specific modules (like the predictor in BYOL), there is
yet no unified theoretical understanding of how these seemingly different
asymmetric designs can all avoid feature collapse, particularly considering
methods that also work without the predictor (like DINO). In this work, we
propose a unified theoretical understanding for existing variants of
non-contrastive learning. Our theory named Rank Differential Mechanism (RDM)
shows that all these asymmetric designs create a consistent rank difference in
their dual-branch output features. This rank difference will provably lead to
an improvement of effective dimensionality and alleviate either complete or
dimensional feature collapse. Different from previous theories, our RDM theory
is applicable to different asymmetric designs (with and without the predictor),
and thus can serve as a unified understanding of existing non-contrastive
learning methods. Besides, our RDM theory also provides practical guidelines
for designing many new non-contrastive variants. We show that these variants
indeed achieve comparable performance to existing methods on benchmark
datasets, and some of them even outperform the baselines. Our code is available
at \url{https://github.com/PKU-ML/Rank-Differential-Mechanism}.

which each node expresses a structural block in the image and each edge
represents the association between two nodes. Specifically:(1) We design a
gradient-based strategy for the adaptive reorganization of all pixels in the
image into numerous rectangular regions, each of which can be regarded as one
node. (2) Each node has a connection edge with the nodes with which it shares
regions. (3) We design a low-dimensional vector as the attribute of each node.
All nodes and their corresponding edges form a graphical representation of a
digital image. In the experiments, our proposed graph representation is applied
to benchmark datasets for image classification tasks, and the efficiency and
good understandability demonstrate that our proposed method offers significant
potential in artificial intelligence theory and application.

					<dc:description>  The performances of defect inspection have been severely hindered by
insufficient defect images in industries, which can be alleviated by generating
more samples as data augmentation. We propose the first defect image generation
method in the challenging few-shot cases. Given just a handful of defect images
and relatively more defect-free ones, our goal is to augment the dataset with
new defect images. Our method consists of two training stages. First, we train
a data-efficient StyleGAN2 on defect-free images as the backbone. Second, we
attach defect-aware residual blocks to the backbone, which learn to produce
reasonable defect masks and accordingly manipulate the features within the
masked regions by training the added modules on limited defect images.
Extensive experiments on MVTec AD dataset not only validate the effectiveness
of our method in generating realistic and diverse defect images, but also
manifest the benefits it brings to downstream defect inspection tasks. Codes
are available at https://github.com/Ldhlwh/DFMGAN.

					<dc:description>  With the explosive increase of User Generated Content (UGC), UGC video
quality assessment (VQA) becomes more and more important for improving users'
Quality of Experience (QoE). However, most existing UGC VQA studies only focus
on the visual distortions of videos, ignoring that the user's QoE also depends
on the accompanying audio signals. In this paper, we conduct the first study to
address the problem of UGC audio and video quality assessment (AVQA).
Specifically, we construct the first UGC AVQA database named the SJTU-UAV
database, which includes 520 in-the-wild UGC audio and video (A/V) sequences,
and conduct a user study to obtain the mean opinion scores of the A/V
sequences. The content of the SJTU-UAV database is then analyzed from both the
audio and video aspects to show the database characteristics. We also design a
family of AVQA models, which fuse the popular VQA methods and audio features
via support vector regressor (SVR). We validate the effectiveness of the
proposed models on the three databases. The experimental results show that with
the help of audio signals, the VQA models can evaluate the perceptual quality
more accurately. The database will be released to facilitate further research.

					<dc:description>  Sequence classification has a wide range of real-world applications in
different domains, such as genome classification in health and anomaly
detection in business. However, the lack of explicit features in sequence data
makes it difficult for machine learning models. While Neural Network (NN)
models address this with learning features automatically, they are limited to
capturing adjacent structural connections and ignore global, higher-order
information between the sequences. To address these challenges in the sequence
classification problems, we propose a novel Hypergraph Attention Network model,
namely Seq-HyGAN. To capture the complex structural similarity between sequence
data, we first create a hypergraph where the sequences are depicted as
hyperedges and subsequences extracted from sequences are depicted as nodes.
Additionally, we introduce an attention-based Hypergraph Neural Network model
that utilizes a two-level attention mechanism. This model generates a sequence
representation as a hyperedge while simultaneously learning the crucial
subsequences for each sequence. We conduct extensive experiments on four data
sets to assess and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Seq-HyGAN model can
effectively classify sequence data and significantly outperform the baselines.
We also conduct case studies to investigate the contribution of each module in
Seq-HyGAN.

					<dc:description>  We perform extensive simulations and systematic statistical analyses of the
structural dynamics of amorphous silicon. The simulations follow the dynamics
introduced by Wooten, Winer and Weaire: the energy is obtained with the Keating
potential, and the dynamics consists of bond transpositions proposed at random
locations and accepted with the Metropolis acceptance ratio. The structural
quantities we track are the variations in time of the lateral lengths
($L_x$,$L_y$,$L_z$) of the cuboid simulation cell. We transform these
quantities into the volume $V$ and two aspect ratios $B_1$ and $B_2$. Our
analysis reveals that at short times, the mean squared displacement (MSD) for
all of them exhibits normal diffusion. At longer times, they cross over to
anomalous diffusion, with a temperature-dependent anomalous exponent
$\alpha&lt;1$. We analyze our findings in the light of two standard models in
statistical physics that feature anomalous dynamics, $viz.$, continuous time
random walker (CTRW) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We obtain the
distribution of waiting times, and find that the data are consistent with a
stretched-exponential decay. We also show that the three quantities, $V$, $B_1$
and $B_2$ exhibit negative velocity autocorrelation functions. These
observations together suggest that the dynamics of the material belong to the
fBm class.

					<dc:description>  In this study, we demonstrate the use of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes in de
Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. These modes describe the
oscillation frequencies of perturbed black holes and are important in
understanding the behavior of these objects. We show that by carefully
selecting the hyperparameters of the PINN, including the network architecture
and the training data, it is possible to achieve good agreement between the
computed QNMs and the approximate analytical formula in the near-extremal limit
for the smallest mode number. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
PINNs for solving inverse problems in the context of QNMs and highlight the
potential of these algorithms for providing valuable insights into the behavior
of black holes.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces the Procedural (audio) Variational autoEncoder (ProVE)
framework as a general approach to learning Procedural Audio PA models of
environmental sounds with an improvement to the realism of the synthesis while
maintaining provision of control over the generated sound through adjustable
parameters. The framework comprises two stages: (i) Audio Class Representation,
in which a latent representation space is defined by training an audio
autoencoder, and (ii) Control Mapping, in which a joint function of
static/temporal control variables derived from the audio and a random sample of
uniform noise is learned to replace the audio encoder. We demonstrate the use
of ProVE through the example of footstep sound effects on various surfaces. Our
results show that ProVE models outperform both classical PA models and an
adversarial-based approach in terms of sound fidelity, as measured by Fr\'echet
Audio Distance (FAD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and subjective
evaluations, making them feasible tools for sound design workflows.

					<dc:description>  Nondipole effects are ubiquitous and crucial in light-matter interaction.
However, they are too weak to be directly observed. In strong-field physics,
motion of electrons is mainly confined in transverse plane of light fields,
which suppresses the significance of nondipole effects. Here, we present a
theoretical study on enhancing and controlling the nondipole effect by using
the synthesized two perpendicularly propagating laser fields. We calculate the
three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distributions of strong-field
tunneling ionization of hydrogen atoms using the classical trajectory Monte
Carlo model and show that the nondipole effects are noticeably enhanced in such
laser fields due to their remarkable influences on the sub-cycle photoelectron
dynamics. In particular, we reveal that the magnitudes of the magnetic and
electric components of nondipole effects can be separately controlled by
modulating the ellipticity and amplitude of driving laser fields. This novel
scenario holds promising applications for future studies with ultrafast
structured light fields.

					<dc:description>  Catastrophic events create uncertain situations for humanitarian
organizations locating and providing aid to affected people. Many people turn
to social media during disasters for requesting help and/or providing relief to
others. However, the majority of social media posts seeking help could not
properly be detected and remained concealed because often they are noisy and
ill-formed. Existing systems lack in planning an effective strategy for tweet
preprocessing and grasping the contexts of tweets. This research, first of all,
formally defines request tweets in the context of social networking sites,
hereafter rweets, along with their different primary types and sub-types. Our
main contributions are the identification and categorization of rweets. For
rweet identification, we employ two approaches, namely a rule-based and
logistic regression, and show their high precision and F1 scores. The rweets
classification into sub-types such as medical, food, and shelter, using
logistic regression shows promising results and outperforms existing works.
Finally, we introduce an architecture to store intermediate data to accelerate
the development process of the machine learning classifiers.

					<dc:description>  Image classification has been one of the most popular tasks in Deep Learning,
seeing an abundance of impressive implementations each year. However, there is
a lot of criticism tied to promoting complex architectures that continuously
push performance metrics higher and higher. Robustness tests can uncover
several vulnerabilities and biases which go unnoticed during the typical model
evaluation stage. So far, model robustness under distribution shifts has mainly
been examined within carefully curated datasets. Nevertheless, such approaches
do not test the real response of classifiers in the wild, e.g. when uncurated
web-crawled image data of corresponding classes are provided. In our work, we
perform fine-grained classification on closely related categories, which are
identified with the help of hierarchical knowledge. Extensive experimentation
on a variety of convolutional and transformer-based architectures reveals model
robustness in this novel setting. Finally, hierarchical knowledge is again
employed to evaluate and explain misclassifications, providing an
information-rich evaluation scheme adaptable to any classifier.

					<dc:description>  Affordance detection is a challenging problem with a wide variety of robotic
applications. Traditional affordance detection methods are limited to a
predefined set of affordance labels, hence potentially restricting the
adaptability of intelligent robots in complex and dynamic environments. In this
paper, we present the Open-Vocabulary Affordance Detection (OpenAD) method,
which is capable of detecting an unbounded number of affordances in 3D point
clouds. By simultaneously learning the affordance text and the point feature,
OpenAD successfully exploits the semantic relationships between affordances.
Therefore, our proposed method enables zero-shot detection and can detect
previously unseen affordances without a single annotation example. Intensive
experimental results show that OpenAD works effectively on a wide range of
affordance detection setups and outperforms other baselines by a large margin.
Additionally, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed OpenAD in
real-world robotic applications with a fast inference speed (~100 ms).

					<dc:description>  The classical approach to analysing extreme value data is the generalized
Pareto distribution (GPD). When the GPD is used to explain a target variable
with the large dimension of covariates, the shape and scale function of
covariates included in GPD are sometimes modeled using the generalized additive
models (GAM). In contrast to many results of application, there are no
theoretical results on the hybrid technique of GAM and GPD, which motivates us
to develop its asymptotic theory. We provide the rate of convergence of the
estimator of shape and scale functions, as well as its local asymptotic
normality.

					<dc:description>  Learning with noisy labels (LNL) aims to ensure model generalization given a
label-corrupted training set. In this work, we investigate a rarely studied
scenario of LNL on fine-grained datasets (LNL-FG), which is more practical and
challenging as large inter-class ambiguities among fine-grained classes cause
more noisy labels. We empirically show that existing methods that work well for
LNL fail to achieve satisfying performance for LNL-FG, arising the practical
need of effective solutions for LNL-FG. To this end, we propose a novel
framework called stochastic noise-tolerated supervised contrastive learning
(SNSCL) that confronts label noise by encouraging distinguishable
representation. Specifically, we design a noise-tolerated supervised
contrastive learning loss that incorporates a weight-aware mechanism for noisy
label correction and selectively updating momentum queue lists. By this
mechanism, we mitigate the effects of noisy anchors and avoid inserting noisy
labels into the momentum-updated queue. Besides, to avoid manually-defined
augmentation strategies in contrastive learning, we propose an efficient
stochastic module that samples feature embeddings from a generated
distribution, which can also enhance the representation ability of deep models.
SNSCL is general and compatible with prevailing robust LNL strategies to
improve their performance for LNL-FG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SNSCL.

					<dc:description>  Many patients with chronic diseases resort to multiple medications to relieve
various symptoms, which raises concerns about the safety of multiple medication
use, as severe drug-drug antagonism can lead to serious adverse effects or even
death. This paper presents a Decision Support System, called DSSDDI, based on
drug-drug interactions to support doctors prescribing decisions. DSSDDI
contains three modules, Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) module, Medical Decision
(MD) module and Medical Support (MS) module. The DDI module learns safer and
more effective drug representations from the drug-drug interactions. To capture
the potential causal relationship between DDI and medication use, the MD module
considers the representations of patients and drugs as context, DDI and
patients' similarity as treatment, and medication use as outcome to construct
counterfactual links for the representation learning. Furthermore, the MS
module provides drug candidates to doctors with explanations. Experiments on
the chronic data collected from the Hong Kong Chronic Disease Study Project and
a public diagnostic data MIMIC-III demonstrate that DSSDDI can be a reliable
reference for doctors in terms of safety and efficiency of clinical diagnosis,
with significant improvements compared to baseline methods.

					<dc:description>  Scattering of superconducting pairs by magnetic impurities on a
superconducting surface leads to pairs of sharp in-gap resonances, known as
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states. Similarly to the interference of itinerant
electrons scattered on defects in normal metals, these resonances reveal a
periodic texture around the magnetic impurity. However, the wavelength of these
resonances was often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic
resolution, like STM. Here, we combine a CO molecule with a superconducting
cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy
resolution. The superior properties of such a double-functionalized probe are
demonstrated by imaging the interference of YSR states around magnetic Fe
dimers on a Nb(110) surface. Our novel approach reveals rich interference
patterns of both the even and odd combinations of the hybridized YSR states,
which are inaccessible with conventional STM probes.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous robots would benefit a lot by gaining the ability to manipulate
their environment to solve path planning tasks, known as the Navigation Among
Movable Obstacle (NAMO) problem. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement
learning approach for solving NAMO locally, near narrow passages. We train
parallel agents in physics simulation using an Advantage Actor-Critic based
algorithm with a multi-modal neural network. We present an online policy that
is able to push obstacles in a non-axial-aligned fashion, react to unexpected
obstacle dynamics in real-time, and solve the local NAMO problem. Experimental
validation in simulation shows that the presented approach generalises to
unseen NAMO problems in unknown environments. We further demonstrate the
implementation of the policy on a real quadrupedal robot, showing that the
policy can deal with real-world sensor noises and uncertainties in unseen NAMO
tasks.

					<dc:description>  Objective: A new method for generating realistic electrogastrogram (EGG) time
series is presented and evaluated. Methods: We used EGG data from an existing
open database to set model parameters and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate a
new model based on the hypothesis that EGG dominant frequency should be
statistically significantly different between fasting and postprandial states.
Additionally, we illustrated method customization for generating artificial EGG
alterations caused by the simulator sickness. Results: The user can specify the
following input parameters of developed data-driven model: (1) duration of the
generated sequence, (2) sampling frequency, (3) recording state (postprandial
or fasting state), (3) breathing artifact contamination, (4) a flag whether the
output would produce plots, (5) seed for the sake of reproducibility, (6)
pauses in the gastric rhythm (arrhythmia occurrence), and (7) overall noise
contamination to produce proper variability in EGG signals. The simulated EGG
provided expected results of Monte Carlo simulation while features obtained
from the synthetic EGG signal resembling simulator sickness occurrence
displayed expected trends. Conclusion: The code for generation of synthetic EGG
time series is freely available and can be further customized to assess
robustness of the signal processing algorithms to noises and especially to
movement artifacts, as well as to simulate alterations of gastric electrical
activity. Significance: The proposed approach is customized for EGG data
synthesis, but it can be further utilized to other biosignals with similar
nature such as electroencephalogram.

					<dc:description>  We prove that the structure algebra of a Bruhat moment graph of a finite real
root system is a Hopf algebroid with respect to the Hecke and the Weyl actions.
We introduce new techniques (reconstruction and push-forward formula of a
product, twisted coproduct, double quotients of bimodules) and apply them
together with our main result to linear algebraic groups, to generalized
Schubert calculus, to combinatorics of Coxeter groups and finite real root
systems. As for groups, it implies that the natural Hopf-algebra structure on
the algebraic oriented cohomology $h(G)$ of Levine-Morel of a split semi-simple
linear algebraic group $G$ can be lifted to a `bi-Hopf' structure on the
$T$-equivariant algebraic oriented cohomology of the complete flag variety. As
for the Schubert calculus, we prove several new identities involving (double)
generalized equivariant Schubert classes. As for finite real root systems, we
compute the Hopf-algebra structure of `virtual cohomology' of dihedral groups
$I_2(p)$, where $p$ is an odd prime.

					<dc:description>  State-of-the-art noisy digital quantum computers can only execute short-depth
quantum circuits. Variational algorithms are a promising route to unlock the
potential of noisy quantum computers since the depth of the corresponding
circuits can be kept well below hardware-imposed limits. Typically, the
variational parameters correspond to virtual $R_Z$ gate angles, implemented by
phase changes of calibrated pulses. By encoding the variational parameters
directly as hardware pulse amplitudes and durations we succeed in further
shortening the pulse schedule and overall circuit duration. This decreases the
impact of qubit decoherence and gate noise. As a demonstration, we apply our
pulse-based variational algorithm to the calculation of the ground state of
different hydrogen-based molecules (H$_2$, H$_3$ and H$_4$) using IBM
cross-resonance-based hardware. We observe a reduction in schedule duration of
up to $5\times$ compared to CNOT-based Ans\&quot;atze, while also reducing the
measured energy. In particular, we observe a sizable improvement of the minimal
energy configuration of H$_3$ compared to a CNOT-based variational form.
Finally, we discuss possible future developments including error mitigation
schemes and schedule optimizations, which will enable further improvements of
our approach paving the way towards the simulation of larger systems on noisy
quantum devices.

					<dc:description>  Recent advancements in visiolinguistic (VL) learning have allowed the
development of multiple models and techniques that offer several impressive
implementations, able to currently resolve a variety of tasks that require the
collaboration of vision and language. Current datasets used for VL pre-training
only contain a limited amount of visual and linguistic knowledge, thus
significantly limiting the generalization capabilities of many VL models.
External knowledge sources such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) are able to cover such generalization gaps by filling in missing
knowledge, resulting in the emergence of hybrid architectures. In the current
survey, we analyze tasks that have benefited from such hybrid approaches.
Moreover, we categorize existing knowledge sources and types, proceeding to
discussion regarding the KG vs LLM dilemma and its potential impact to future

					<dc:description>  We propose a method for optimal Bayesian filtering with deterministic
particles. In order to avoid particle degeneration, the filter step is not
performed at once. Instead, the particles progressively flow from prior to
posterior. This is achieved by splitting the filter step into a series of
sub-steps. In each sub-step, optimal resampling is done by a map that replaces
non-equally weighted particles with equally weighted ones. Inversions of the
maps or monotonicity constraints are not required, greatly simplifying the
procedure. The parameters of the mapping network are optimized w.r.t.\ to a
particle set distance. This distance is differentiable, and compares
non-equally and equally weighted particles. Composition of the map sequence
provides a final mapping from prior to posterior particles. Radial basis
function neural networks are used as maps. It is important that no intermediate
continuous density representation is required. The entire flow works directly
with particle representations. This avoids costly density estimation.

					<dc:description>  Markerless pose estimation allows reconstructing human movement from multiple
synchronized and calibrated views, and has the potential to make movement
analysis easy and quick, including gait analysis. This could enable much more
frequent and quantitative characterization of gait impairments, allowing better
monitoring of outcomes and responses to interventions. However, the impact of
different keypoint detectors and reconstruction algorithms on markerless pose
estimation accuracy has not been thoroughly evaluated. We tested these
algorithmic choices on data acquired from a multicamera system from a
heterogeneous sample of 25 individuals seen in a rehabilitation hospital. We
found that using a top-down keypoint detector and reconstructing trajectories
with an implicit function enabled accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible
trajectories, with a noise in the step width estimates compared to a GaitRite
walkway of only 8mm.

					<dc:description>  Kinetic helicity (hereafter helicity) is defined by the correlation between
the velocity and the flow-aligned vorticity. Helicity, as well as energy, is an
inviscid invariant of the hydrodynamic equations. In contrast to energy, a
measure of the turbulent intensity, turbulent helicity, representing right- and
left-handed twist associated with a fluctuating motion, provides a measure of
the structural or topological property of the fluctuation. The helicity effect
on the turbulent transport can be analytically obtained in the framework of the
multiple-scale renormalized perturbation expansion theory through the inclusion
of the non-reflectionally-symmetric part for the lowest-order (homogeneous and
isotropic) velocity correlation. The physical significance of the
helicity-related contribution to the momentum transport is explained. By
utilizing the analytical expression of the Reynolds stress, a turbulence model
with helicity effect incorporated (helicity model) is constructed. This
helicity model is applied to a swirling flow to show its validity in describing
the prominent properties of the flow. In addition to the transport suppression,
inhomogeneous helicity coupled with a rotation can induce a large-scale flow.
The results of direct numerical simulations (DNSs) confirming the global flow
generation by helicity will be also reviewed, followed by several possible
applications in geo- and astro-physical flow phenomena.

					<dc:description>  The non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered many-body quantum systems after a
global quantum quench unveils important insights about the competition between
interactions and disorder, yielding in particular an insightful perspective on
many body localization (MBL). Still, the experimentally relevant effect of bond
randomness in long-range interacting spin chains on the quantum quench dynamics
have so far not been investigated. In this letter, we examine the entanglement
entropy growth after a global quench in a quantum spin chain with randomly
placed spins and long-range tunable interactions decaying with distance with
power $\alpha$. Using a dynamical version of the strong disorder
renormalization group (SDRG) we find for $\alpha &gt;\alpha_c$ that the
entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time and becomes smaller with
larger $\alpha$ as $S(t) = S_p \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$. Here, $S_p= 2 \ln2 -1$. We
use numerical exact diagonalization (ED) simulations to verify our results for
system sizes up to $ N\sim 16$ spins, yielding good agreement for sufficiently
large $\alpha &gt; \alpha_c \approx 1.8$. For $\alpha&lt;\alpha_c$, we find that the
entanglement entropy grows as a power-law with time, $S(t)\sim
t^{\gamma(\alpha)}$ with $0&lt;\gamma(\alpha)&lt;1$ a decaying function of the
interaction exponent $\alpha$.

					<dc:description>  Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved promising progress with the advent
of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and BEiT. However, subsequent works have
complicated the framework with new auxiliary tasks or extra pre-trained models,
inevitably increasing computational overhead. This paper undertakes a
fundamental analysis of MIM from the perspective of pixel reconstruction, which
examines the input image patches and reconstruction target, and highlights two
critical but previously overlooked bottlenecks.Based on this analysis, we
propose a remarkably simple and effective method, PixMIM, that entails two
strategies: 1) filtering the high-frequency components from the reconstruction
target to de-emphasize the network's focus on texture-rich details and 2)
adopting a conservative data transform strategy to alleviate the problem of
missing foreground in MIM training. PixMIM can be easily integrated into most
existing pixel-based MIM approaches (i.e., using raw images as reconstruction
target) with negligible additional computation. Without bells and whistles, our
method consistently improves three MIM approaches, MAE, ConvMAE, and LSMAE,
across various downstream tasks. We believe this effective plug-and-play method
will serve as a strong baseline for self-supervised learning and provide
insights for future improvements of the MIM framework. Code will be available
at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmselfsup.

					<dc:description>  Multi-types of user behavior data (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, and
purchasing) are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which can
help to learn users' multi-faceted preferences. However, it is challenging to
explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse
target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations
when treating multi-behavior data ''as features'' and gradient conflict in
multitask learning when treating multi-behavior data ''as labels''. In this
paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to
overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed
Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level
high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict
when treating multi-behavior data ''as labels'', we propose a Multi-Expert with
Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for
multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF. Ablation studies and in-depth
analysis further validate the effectiveness of our proposed model in capturing
high-order relations and alleviating gradient conflict. The source code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/MC-CV/CIGF.

					<dc:description>  We consider a wireless network where N nodes compete for a shared channel
over the CSMA/CA protocol to deliver observed updates to a common remote
monitor. For this network, we rate the information freshness of the CSMA/CA
based network using the age of information (AoI). Different from previous work,
the network we consider is unsaturated. To theoretically analyze the
transmission behavior of the CSMA/CA based network, we, therefore, develop an
equivalent and tractable Markov transmission model. Based on this newly
developed model, the transmission probability, collision probability and
average AoI of the network are obtained. Our numerical results show that as the
packet rate and the number of nodes increase, both the transmission probability
and collision probability are increasing; the average AoI first decreases and
then increases as the packet rate increases and increases with the number of
nodes.

					<dc:description>  Biological sequence analysis is an essential step toward building a deeper
understanding of the underlying functions, structures, and behaviors of the
sequences. It can help in identifying the characteristics of the associated
organisms, like viruses, etc., and building prevention mechanisms to eradicate
their spread and impact, as viruses are known to cause epidemics that can
become pandemics globally. New tools for biological sequence analysis are
provided by machine learning (ML) technologies to effectively analyze the
functions and structures of the sequences. However, these ML-based methods
undergo challenges with data imbalance, generally associated with biological
sequence datasets, which hinders their performance. Although various strategies
are present to address this issue, like the SMOTE algorithm, which creates
synthetic data, however, they focus on local information rather than the
overall class distribution. In this work, we explore a novel approach to handle
the data imbalance issue based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which
use the overall data distribution. GANs are utilized to generate synthetic data
that closely resembles the real one, thus this generated data can be employed
to enhance the ML models' performance by eradicating the class imbalance
problem for biological sequence analysis. We perform 3 distinct classification
tasks by using 3 different sequence datasets (Influenza A Virus, PALMdb, VDjDB)
and our results illustrate that GANs can improve the overall classification
performance.

					<dc:description>  Quench dynamics of fermionic superfluids is an active topic both
experimentally and theoretically. Using the BCS theory, such non-equilibrium
problems can be reduced to nearly independent spin dynamics only with a
time-dependent mean-field pairing term. This results in persisting oscillations
of the paring strength in certain parameter regimes. In experiments, however,
it is observed that the oscillation decays rapidly when the interaction becomes
strong, such as in the unitary fermi gas. A theoretical analysis is still
absent. In this work, we construct an SYK-like model to analyze the effect of
strong interactions in one dimensional BCS system. We utilize the large-$N$
approximation and Green's function-based technique to solve the equilibrium
problem and quench dynamics. We find that a strong SYK interaction suppresses
the paring order. We further verify that the system quickly thermalizes with
SYK interactions for both intrinsic pairing order or proximity effect, which
leads to a rapid decay of the strength of the oscillations. The decay rates
exhibit different scaling laws against SYK interaction, which can be understood
in terms of the Boltzmann equation. Our work makes a first step towards the
understanding of attenuating dynamics of strongly interacting fermionic
superfluids.

					<dc:title>Estimating Age of Information Using Finite Order Moments</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Chen, Licheng</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Dong, Yunquan</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Age of information (AoI) has been proposed as a more suitable metric for
characterizing the freshness of information than traditional metrics like delay
and throughput. However, the calculation of AoI requires complex analysis and
strict end-to-end synchronization. Most existential AoI-related works have
assumed that the statistical characterizations of the arrival process and the
service process are known. In fact, due to the randomness of the sources and
the channel noises, these processes are often unavailable in reality. To this
end, we propose a method to estimate the average AoI on a point-to-point
wireless Rayleigh channel, which uses the available finite order statistical
moments of the arrival process. Based on this method, we explicitly present the
upper and lower bounds on the average AoI of the system. Our results show that
1) with the increase of the traffic intensity, the absolute error of the
estimated average AoI bounds is first increasing and then decreasing, while the
average AoI is monotonically increasing; 2) the average AoI can be effectively
approximated by using the first two order moment estimation bounds, especially
when traffic intensity is small or approaches unity; 3) tighter bounds can be
obtained by using more moments.

					<dc:description>  How does one measure the angular momentum carried away by gravitational
radiation during the merger of a binary black hole? This has been a subtle
issue since the 1960's due to the discovery of ``supertranslation ambiguity&quot;:
the angular momentum recorded by two distant observers of the same system may
not be the same. In this talk, I shall describe how the theory of quasilocal
mass and optimal isometric embedding identifies a new definition of angular
momentum that is free of any supertranslation ambiguity. This is based on joint
work with Po-Ning Chen, Jordan Keller, Ye-Kai Wang, and Shing-Tung Yau.

					<dc:description>  It has been demonstrated that the critical point of the phase transition in
scalar quantum field theory with a quartic interaction in one space dimension
can be approximated via a Gaussian Effective Potential (GEP). We discuss how
this critical point can be estimated using quantum hardware. We perform quantum
computations with various lattice sizes and obtain evidence of a transition
from a symmetric to a symmetry-broken phase. We use both discrete- and
continuous-variable quantum computation. We implement the ten-site case on IBM
quantum hardware using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to
minimize the GEP and identify lattice level-crossings. These are extrapolated
via simulations to find the continuum critical point.

					<dc:description>  Designing a synthetic crown is a time-consuming, inconsistent, and
labor-intensive process. In this work, we present a fully automatic method that
not only learns human design dental crowns, but also improves the consistency,
functionality, and esthetic of the crowns. Following success in point cloud
completion using the transformer-based network, we tackle the problem of the
crown generation as a point-cloud completion around a prepared tooth. To this
end, we use a geometry-aware transformer to generate dental crowns. Our main
contribution is to add a margin line information to the network, as the
accuracy of generating a precise margin line directly,determines whether the
designed crown and prepared tooth are closely matched to
allowappropriateadhesion.Using our ground truth crown, we can extract the
margin line as a spline and sample the spline into 1000 points. We feed the
obtained margin line along with two neighbor teeth of the prepared tooth and
three closest teeth in the opposing jaw. We also add the margin line points to
our ground truth crown to increase the resolution at the margin line. Our
experimental results show an improvement in the quality of the designed crown
when considering the actual context composed of the prepared tooth along with
the margin line compared with a crown generated in an empty space as was done
by other studies in the literature.

					<dc:description>  We explore the possibility of meta-learning for the language-independent
unsupervised tokenization problem for English, Russian, and Chinese. We
implement the meta-learning approach for automatic determination of
hyper-parameters of the unsupervised tokenization model proposed in earlier
works, relying on various human-independent fitness functions such as
normalised anti-entropy, compression factor and cross-split F 1 score, as well
as additive and multiplicative composite combinations of the three metrics,
testing them against the conventional F1 tokenization score. We find a fairly
good correlation between the latter and the additive combination of the former
three metrics for English and Russian. In case of Chinese, we find a
significant correlation between the F 1 score and the compression factor. Our
results suggest the possibility of robust unsupervised tokenization of
low-resource and dead languages and allow us to think about human languages in
terms of the evolution of efficient symbolic communication codes with different
structural optimisation schemes that have evolved in different human cultures.

					<dc:description>  The current large blockchain systems (BTC Lightning network, Ethereum, etc.)
are generally facing the problems of low persistence rates and high storage
costs. Therefore, users tend to store single modal (textual) information on the
existing blockchain systems. Inspired by semantic communication algorithms,
this paper presents a new algorithm to solve the serious imbalance between
textual and visual modals on blockchains. After semantic sampling of the
original visual image, the resulting semantic text will be stored on the chain,
and the end users can reconstruct a semantically similar image using the
\textbf{R}elative \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{I}sotope
\textbf{S}election algorithm. Experiments on the DIV2K dataset show that the
blockchain with our algorithm can achieve 430,000 times the storage capacity
and 550,000 times the persistence rate for the original visual data with
acceptable semantic information loss.

					<dc:description>  Game engines provide video game developers with a wide range of fundamental
subsystems for creating games, such as 2D/3D graphics rendering, input device
management, and audio playback. Developers often integrate these subsystems
with other applications or extend them via plugins. To integrate or extend
correctly, developers need a broad system architectural understanding. However,
architectural information is not always readily available and is often
overlooked in this kind of system. In this work, we propose an approach for
game engine architecture recovery and explore the architecture of three popular
open-source game engines (Cocos2d-x, Godot, and Urho3D). We perform manual
subsystem detection and use Moose, a platform for software analysis, to
generate architectural models. With these models, we answer the following
questions: Which subsystems are present in game engines? Which subsystems are
more often coupled with one another? Why are these subsystems coupled with each
other? Results show that the platform independence, resource management, world
editor, and core subsystems are frequently included by others and therefore act
as foundations for the game engines. Furthermore, we show that, by applying our
approach, game engine developers can understand whether subsystems are related
and divide responsibilities. They can also assess whether relationships among
subsystems are appropriate for the game engine.

					<dc:description>  Generative flow networks (GFlowNets), as an emerging technique, can be used
as an alternative to reinforcement learning for exploratory control tasks.
GFlowNet aims to generate distribution proportional to the rewards over
terminating states, and to sample different candidates in an active learning
fashion. GFlowNets need to form a DAG and compute the flow matching loss by
traversing the inflows and outflows of each node in the trajectory. No
experiments have yet concluded that GFlowNets can be used to handle continuous
tasks. In this paper, we propose generative continuous flow networks
(CFlowNets) that can be applied to continuous control tasks. First, we present
the theoretical formulation of CFlowNets. Then, a training framework for
CFlowNets is proposed, including the action selection process, the flow
approximation algorithm, and the continuous flow matching loss function.
Afterward, we theoretically prove the error bound of the flow approximation.
The error decreases rapidly as the number of flow samples increases. Finally,
experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate the performance
advantages of CFlowNets compared to many reinforcement learning methods,
especially regarding exploration ability.

					<dc:description>  We introduce a new class of random Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes
derived from the cryptanalysis of the so-called NTRU cryptosystem. The derived
codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling
$\Delta \propto \sqrt{n}$ with high probability, where $n$ is the number of
bosonic modes, which is a distance scaling equivalent to that of a GKP code
obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error
correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has
the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model
is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random
instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This
construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error
correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We
underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding
GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum
communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.

					<dc:description>  Understanding properties in out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum systems is
an essential task in modern physics. While cutting-edge numerical methods have
been developed, extracting the universal dynamics of generic many-body quantum
systems remains a big challenge. The multi-channel Kondo impurity (MCKI) model,
one of the exotic phases of matter that hosts an over-screened Kondo state with
non-Fermi liquid properties, provides a platform for theoretically studying the
universal properties of quantum dynamics in many-body systems. By using the
large-N Schwinger-Keldysh approach, we systematically investigate transient
dynamics and long-time thermalization properties in MCKI under a sudden change
of the Kondo coupling. We observe general oscillation patterns with a universal
frequency in physical quantities for the initial state being over-screened
Kondo state under the sudden quench while the no oscillations for the initial
state being a high-temepreature Fermi liquid state due to the de-phasing.
Additionally, we find that the equilibration of the system heavily depends on
the initial state and the quench protocol. On top of the numerical analysis, we
also provide a phenomenological analysis for the equilibration using the
quantum Boltzmann equation. Our approach sheds light on the universal
properties of quantum dynamics and offers deeper insights into quantum
thermalization.

are simple and apply in very general settings that may be of arbitrary
dimensions and may include pointwise and integral constraints, thereby
considerably strengthening the existing results. Our conditions are also
extended to optimal control problems. In addition, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in non-convex settings, showing that the occupation
measure relaxation is at least as strong as the convexification using the
convex envelope; in doing so, we prove that a certain weakening of the
occupation measure relaxation is equivalent to the convex envelope. This opens
the way to application of the occupation measure relaxation in situations where
the convex envelope relaxation is known to be equivalent to the original
problem, which includes problems in magnetism and elasticity.

					<dc:description>  We consider the initial value problem (IVP) associated to the cubic nonlinear
Schr\&quot;odinger equation with third-order dispersion
  \begin{equation*} \partial_{t}u+i\alpha \partial^{2}_{x}u-
\partial^{3}_{x}u+i\beta|u|^{2}u = 0,
  \quad x,t \in \mathbb{R}, \end{equation*} for given data in the Sobolev space
$H^s(\mathbb{R})$. This IVP is known to be locally well-posed for given data
with Sobolev regularity $s&gt;-\frac14$ and globally well-posed for $s\geq 0$ [3].
For given data in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$, $0&gt;s&gt; -\frac14$ no global well-posedness
result is known. In this work, we derive an almost conserved quantity for such
data and obtain a sharp global well-posedness result. Our result answers the
question left open in [3].

					<dc:description>  We introduce a novel three-body correlation factor that is designed to vanish
in the core region around each nucleus and approach a universal two-body
correlation factor for valence electrons. The Transcorrelated Hamiltonian is
used to optimize the orbitals of a single Slater determinant within a
biorthonormal framework. The Slater-Jastrow wave function is optimized on a set
of atomic and molecular systems containing both second-row elements and $3d$
transition metal elements. The optimization of the correlation factor and the
orbitals, along with increasing the basis set, results in a systematic lowering
of the Variational Monte Carlo energy for all systems tested. Importantly, the
optimal parameters of the correlation factor obtained for atomic systems are
transferable to molecules. Additionally, the present correlation factor is
computationally efficient, using a mixed analytical-numerical integration
scheme that reduces the costly numerical integration from $\mathbb{R}^6$ to
$\mathbb{R}^3$.

					<dc:description>  Zero-shot capability has been considered as a new revolution of deep
learning, letting machines work on tasks without curated training data. As a
good start and the only existing outcome of zero-shot image captioning (IC),
ZeroCap abandons supervised training and sequentially searches every word in
the caption using the knowledge of large-scale pretrained models. Though
effective, its autoregressive generation and gradient-directed searching
mechanism limit the diversity of captions and inference speed, respectively.
Moreover, ZeroCap does not consider the controllability issue of zero-shot IC.
To move forward, we propose a framework for Controllable Zero-shot IC, named
ConZIC. The core of ConZIC is a novel sampling-based non-autoregressive
language model named GibbsBERT, which can generate and continuously polish
every word. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed ConZIC for both zero-shot IC and
controllable zero-shot IC. Especially, ConZIC achieves about 5x faster
generation speed than ZeroCap, and about 1.5x higher diversity scores, with
accurate generation given different control signals.

					<dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Model-based clustering of moderate or large dimensional data is notoriously
difficult. We propose a model for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and
clustering by assuming a mixture model for a set of latent scores, which are
then linked to the observations via a Gaussian latent factor model. This
approach was recently investigated by Chandra et al. (2020). The authors use a
factor-analytic representation and assume a mixture model for the latent
factors. However, performance can deteriorate in the presence of model
misspecification. Assuming a repulsive point process prior for the
component-specific means of the mixture for the latent scores is shown to yield
a more robust model that outperforms the standard mixture model for the latent
factors in several simulated scenarios. To favor well-separated clusters of
data, the repulsive point process must be anisotropic, and its density should
be tractable for efficient posterior inference. We address these issues by
proposing a general construction for anisotropic determinantal point processes.

					<dc:description>  This work presents an open source, dislocation density based crystal
plasticity modeling framework, $\rho$-CP. A Kocks-type thermally activated flow
is used for accounting for the temperature and strain rate effects on the
crystallograpphic shearing rate. Slip system-level mobile and immobile
dislocation densities, as well slip system-level backstress, are used as
internal state variables for representing the substructure evolution during
plastic deformation. A fully implicit numerical integration scheme is presented
for the time integration of the finite deformation plasticity model. The
framework is implemented and integrated with the open source finite element
solver, Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). Example
applications of the model are demonstrated for predicting the anisotropic
mechanical response of single and polycrystalline hcp magnesium, strain rate
effects and cyclic deformation of polycrystalline fcc OFHC copper, and
temperature and strain rate effects on the thermo-mechanical deformation of
polycrystalline bcc tantanlum. Simulations of realistic Voronoi-tessellated
microstructures as well as Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD)
microstructures are demonstrated to highlight the model's ability to predict
large deformation and misorientation developement during plastic deformation.

					<dc:description>  Airport ground handling (AGH) offers necessary operations to flights during
their turnarounds and is of great importance to the efficiency of airport
management and the economics of aviation. Such a problem involves the interplay
among the operations that leads to NP-hard problems with complex constraints.
Hence, existing methods for AGH are usually designed with massive domain
knowledge but still fail to yield high-quality solutions efficiently. In this
paper, we aim to enhance the solution quality and computation efficiency for
solving AGH. Particularly, we first model AGH as a multiple-fleet vehicle
routing problem (VRP) with miscellaneous constraints including precedence, time
windows, and capacity. Then we propose a construction framework that decomposes
AGH into sub-problems (i.e., VRPs) in fleets and present a neural method to
construct the routing solutions to these sub-problems. In specific, we resort
to deep learning and parameterize the construction heuristic policy with an
attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is
shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction
heuristics and the specialized methods for AGH. Besides, we empirically verify
that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of
flights or varying parameters, and can be readily adapted to solve real-time
AGH with stochastic flight arrivals. Our code is publicly available at:

					<dc:description>  Transformer models have achieved profound success in prediction tasks in a
wide range of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition
and computer vision. Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains
requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To
address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which
performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head
attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It
replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and
uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior
processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text,
images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive
accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and
out-of-distribution robustness and detection.

					<dc:description>  Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) aims to learn a global model from
different clients in an environment with both labeled and unlabeled data. Most
of the existing FSSL work generally assumes that both types of data are
available on each client. In this paper, we study a more general problem setup
of FSSL with annotation heterogeneity, where each client can hold an arbitrary
percentage (0%-100%) of labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel FSSL
framework called Heterogeneously Annotated Semi-Supervised LEarning (HASSLE).
Specifically, it is a dual-model framework with two models trained separately
on labeled and unlabeled data such that it can be simply applied to a client
with an arbitrary labeling percentage. Furthermore, a mutual learning strategy
called Supervised-Unsupervised Mutual Alignment (SUMA) is proposed for the dual
models within HASSLE with global residual alignment and model proximity
alignment. Subsequently, the dual models can implicitly learn from both types
of data across different clients, although each dual model is only trained
locally on a single type of data. Experiments verify that the dual models in
HASSLE learned by SUMA can mutually learn from each other, thereby effectively
utilizing the information of both types of data across different clients.

					<dc:description>  In the mobile communication field, some of the video applications boosted the
interest of robust methods for video quality assessment. Out of all existing
methods, We Preferred, No Reference Video Quality Assessment is the one which
is most needed in situations where the handiness of reference video is
partially available. Our research interest lies in formulating and melding
effective features into one model based on human visualizing characteristics.
Our work explores comparative study between Supervised and unsupervised
learning methods. Therefore, we implemented support vector regression algorithm
as NR-based Video Quality Metric(VQM) for quality estimation with simplified
input features. We concluded that our proposed model exhibited sparseness even
after dimension reduction for objective scores of SSIM quality metric.

					<dc:description>  Existing flexible electronics are planar, nonbreathable, and easily damaged.
In this work, authors introduce a new paradigm of free-form three-dimensional
integrated circuits assembled on a single textile thread for ultimate
flexibility. Transistors are assembled as daisy chain on a thread and utilize
deep eutectic solvent gels, or eutectogels as nonvolatile, breathable, and
repairable dielectric for gating organic electrochemical transistor. The
eutectogels provide stable transistor performance without the need for
encapsulation, are air permeable to the skin, and make the Organic Eutectogel
Gated Electrochemical Transistor (OEGET) a promising candidate for wearable
electronics. Complex analog integrated circuits, such as single stage and
multi-stage amplifiers can be realized on a single thread which can bend out of
the plane of stretching for true three-dimensional flexibility. An all-thread
based wearable that uses a thread-based strain sensor and thread-based
integrated circuit for eye motion and respiration monitoring is also presented.

					<dc:description>  Uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs) has
received increasing attention over the years. Existing literature mainly focus
on selecting a subgraph, through combinatorial optimization, to provide
faithful explanations. However, the exponential size of candidate subgraphs
limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods to large-scale GNNs. We
enhance on this through a different approach: by proposing a generative
structure -- GFlowNets-based GNN Explainer (GFlowExplainer), we turn the
optimization problem into a step-by-step generative problem. Our GFlowExplainer
aims to learn a policy that generates a distribution of subgraphs for which the
probability of a subgraph is proportional to its' reward. The proposed approach
eliminates the influence of node sequence and thus does not need any
pre-training strategies. We also propose a new cut vertex matrix to efficiently
explore parent states for GFlowNets structure, thus making our approach
applicable in a large-scale setting. We conduct extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets, and both qualitative and quantitative results show
the superiority of our GFlowExplainer.

					<dc:description>  Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
long been suffering from fragmentary object regions led by Class Activation Map
(CAM), which is incapable of generating fine-grained masks for semantic
segmentation. To guide CAM to find more non-discriminating object patterns,
this paper turns to an interesting working mechanism in agent learning named
Complementary Learning System (CLS). CLS holds that the neocortex builds a
sensation of general knowledge, while the hippocampus specially learns specific
details, completing the learned patterns. Motivated by this simple but
effective learning pattern, we propose a General-Specific Learning Mechanism
(GSLM) to explicitly drive a coarse-grained CAM to a fine-grained pseudo mask.
Specifically, GSLM develops a General Learning Module (GLM) and a Specific
Learning Module (SLM). The GLM is trained with image-level supervision to
extract coarse and general localization representations from CAM. Based on the
general knowledge in the GLM, the SLM progressively exploits the specific
spatial knowledge from the localization representations, expanding the CAM in
an explicit way. To this end, we propose the Seed Reactivation to help SLM
reactivate non-discriminating regions by setting a boundary for activation
values, which successively identifies more regions of CAM. Without extra
refinement processes, our method is able to achieve breakthrough improvements
for CAM of over 20.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 10.0% mIoU on MS COCO 2014
datasets, representing a new state-of-the-art among existing WSSS methods.

					<dc:description>  Classically conformal Standard Model extensions predict an intriguing thermal
history of the early universe. In contrast to the common paradigm, the onset of
the electroweak phase transition can be significantly delayed while the
universe undergoes a period of thermal inflation. Then, a first-order chiral
phase transition could not only trigger electroweak symmetry breaking but also
initiate the exit from supercooling. To study the dynamics of this scenario, we
focus on low-energy quark-based QCD effective models that exhibit a first-order
transition. While a large amount of latent heat is naturally involved if
thermal inflation ends, we find that a supercooling period prior to the QCD
scale considerably enhances the timescale of the transition. This enhancement
implies great observational prospects at future gravitational wave
observatories. Our results are readily applicable to a wide class of
scale-invariant SM extensions, as well as strongly coupled dark sectors.

					<dc:description>  Multitask learning (MTL) can utilize the relatedness between multiple tasks
for performance improvement. The advent of multimodal data allows tasks to be
referenced by multiple indices. High-order tensors are capable of providing
efficient representations for such tasks, while preserving structural
task-relations. In this paper, a new MTL method is proposed by leveraging
low-rank tensor analysis and constructing tensorized Least Squares Support
Vector Machines, namely the tLSSVM-MTL, where multilinear modelling and its
nonlinear extensions can be flexibly exerted. We employ a high-order tensor for
all the weights with each mode relating to an index and factorize it with CP
decomposition, assigning a shared factor for all tasks and retaining
task-specific latent factors along each index. Then an alternating algorithm is
derived for the nonconvex optimization, where each resulting subproblem is
solved by a linear system. Experimental results demonstrate promising
performances of our tLSSVM-MTL.

					<dc:description>  Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are compact and efficient by using binary
weights instead of real-valued weights. Current BNNs use latent real-valued
weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited
from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these
hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs,
however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is
unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay,
which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples
are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay,
which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is
interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary
weights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based
hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network
optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based
hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new
optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are
independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved
understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the
hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for
improved accuracy. Code is available at

					<dc:description>  Scene flow estimation, which predicts the 3D motion of scene points from
point clouds, is a core task in autonomous driving and many other 3D vision
applications. Existing methods either suffer from structure distortion due to
ignorance of rigid motion consistency or require explicit pose estimation and
3D object segmentation. Errors of estimated poses and segmented objects would
yield inaccurate rigidity constraints and in turn mislead scene flow
estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel weight-sharing aggregation (WSA)
method for feature and scene flow up-sampling. WSA does not rely on estimated
poses and segmented objects, and can implicitly enforce rigidity constraints to
avoid structure distortion in scene flow estimation. To further exploit
geometric information and preserve local structure, we design a moving cost
volume aim to keep the local region invariance. We modify the PointPWC-Net and
integrate the proposed WSA and moving cost volume into the enhanced
PointPWC-Net to derive an end-to-end scene flow estimation network, called
WSAFlowNet. Extensive experimental results on the FlyingThings3D [19] and KITTI
[21]datasets demonstrate that our WSAFlowNet achieves the state-ofthe-art
performance and outperforms previous methods by a large margin. We will release
the source code at https://github.com/wangyunlhr/WSAFlowNet.git

					<dc:description>  In the field of human pose estimation, regression-based methods have been
dominated in terms of speed, while heatmap-based methods are far ahead in terms
of performance. How to take advantage of both schemes remains a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel human pose estimation framework
termed DistilPose, which bridges the gaps between heatmap-based and
regression-based methods. Specifically, DistilPose maximizes the transfer of
knowledge from the teacher model (heatmap-based) to the student model
(regression-based) through Token-distilling Encoder (TDE) and Simulated
Heatmaps. TDE aligns the feature spaces of heatmap-based and regression-based
models by introducing tokenization, while Simulated Heatmaps transfer explicit
guidance (distribution and confidence) from teacher heatmaps into student
models. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DistilPose can
significantly improve the performance of the regression-based models while
maintaining efficiency. Specifically, on the MSCOCO validation dataset,
DistilPose-S obtains 71.6% mAP with 5.36M parameter, 2.38 GFLOPs and 40.2 FPS,
which saves 12.95x, 7.16x computational cost and is 4.9x faster than its
teacher model with only 0.9 points performance drop. Furthermore, DistilPose-L
obtains 74.4% mAP on MSCOCO validation dataset, achieving a new
state-of-the-art among predominant regression-based models.

					<dc:description>  Physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) requires both compliance and safety
guarantees since robots coordinate with human actions in a shared workspace.
This paper presents a novel fixed-time adaptive neural control methodology for
handling time-varying workspace constraints that occur in physical human-robot
collaboration while also guaranteeing compliance during intended force
interactions. The proposed methodology combines the benefits of compliance
control, time-varying integral barrier Lyapunov function (TVIBLF) and
fixed-time techniques, which not only achieve compliance during physical
contact with human operators but also guarantee time-varying workspace
constraints and fast tracking error convergence without any restriction on the
initial conditions. Furthermore, a neural adaptive control law is designed to
compensate for the unknown dynamics and disturbances of the robot manipulator
such that the proposed control framework is overall fixed-time converged and
capable of online learning without any prior knowledge of robot dynamics and
disturbances. The proposed approach is finally validated on a simulated
two-link robot manipulator. Simulation results show that the proposed
controller is superior in the sense of both tracking error and convergence time
compared with the existing barrier Lyapunov functions based controllers, while
simultaneously guaranteeing compliance and safety.

					<dc:description>  Two near-threshold peaking structures with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC}
}=0^{++}$ were recently discovered by the LHCb collaboration in the $
D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-}$ invariant mass distribution of the decay $ B^{+}\rightarrow
D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-}K^{+}$. The first of them is the resonance $X(3960)$, whereas
the second one is a structure with the mass around $4140~\mathrm{MeV}$: the
latter is labeled as $X_0(4140)$ in the current article. To explore their
natures and model them, we study the hadronic molecule
$\mathcal{M}=D_s^{+}D_s^{-}$ and calculate its mass, current coupling, and
width. The mass and current coupling of the molecule are extracted from the QCD
two-point sum rule analyses by taking into account vacuum condensates up to
dimension $10$. To evaluate its full width, we consider the processes
$\mathcal{M} \to D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-}$ and $\mathcal{ M}
\to\eta_{c}\eta^{(\prime)}$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by
the strong couplings $g_i, \ i=1,2,3$ at vertices $\mathcal{M}
D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-}$ and $\mathcal{M}\eta_{c} \eta^{(\prime)}$. They are
computed by means of the three-point sum rule method. Predictions for the mass
$m=(4117 \pm 85)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma=(59 \pm 12)~\mathrm{MeV% }$ of
the molecule $\mathcal{M}$ are compared with the corresponding LHCb data, and
also with our results for the diquark-antidiquark state $X=[cs][
\overline{c}\overline{s}]$. We argue that the structure $X_0(4140)$ may be
interpreted as the hadronic molecule $D_s^{+}D_s^{-}$, whereas the resonance
$X(3960)$ can be identified with the tetraquark $X$. \end{abstract}

					<dc:description>  We introduce a numerical linked cluster expansion for square-lattice models
whose building block is an L-shape cluster. This expansion exhibits a similar
or better convergence of the bare sums than that of the (larger) square-shaped
clusters, and can be used with resummation techniques (like the site- and
bond-based expansions) to obtain results at even lower temperatures. We compare
the performance of weak- and strong-embedding versions of this expansion in
spin-1/2 models, and show that the strong-embedding version is preferable
because of its convergence properties and lower computational cost. Finally, we
show that the expansion based on the L-shape cluster can be naturally used to
study properties of lattice models that smoothly connect the square and
triangular lattice geometries.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the dynamics of a general class of antiholomorphic
correspondences; i.e., multi-valued maps with antiholomorphic local branches,
on the Riemann sphere. Such correspondences are closely related to a class of
single-valued antiholomorphic maps in one complex variable; namely, Schwarz
reflection maps of simply connected quadrature domains. Using this connection,
we prove that matings of all parabolic antiholomorphic rational maps with
connected Julia sets (of arbitrary degree) and antiholomorphic analogues of
Hecke groups can be realized as such correspondences. We also draw the same
conclusion when parabolic maps are replaced with critically non-recurrent
antiholomorphic polynomials with connected Julia sets.

					<dc:description>  A key challenge for much of the machine learning work on remote sensing and
earth observation data is the difficulty in acquiring large amounts of
accurately labeled data. This is particularly true for semantic segmentation
tasks, which are much less common in the remote sensing domain because of the
incredible difficulty in collecting precise, accurate, pixel-level annotations
at scale. Recent efforts have addressed these challenges both through the
creation of supervised datasets as well as the application of self-supervised
methods. We continue these efforts on both fronts. First, we generate and
release an improved version of the Agriculture-Vision dataset (Chiu et al.,
2020b) to include raw, full-field imagery for greater experimental flexibility.
Second, we extend this dataset with the release of 3600 large, high-resolution
(10cm/pixel), full-field, red-green-blue and near-infrared images for
pre-training. Third, we incorporate the Pixel-to-Propagation Module Xie et al.
(2021b) originally built on the SimCLR framework into the framework of MoCo-V2
Chen et al.(2020b). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this data by
benchmarking different contrastive learning approaches on both downstream
classification and semantic segmentation tasks. We explore both CNN and Swin
Transformer Liu et al. (2021a) architectures within different frameworks based
on MoCo-V2. Together, these approaches enable us to better detect key
agricultural patterns of interest across a field from aerial imagery so that
farmers may be alerted to problematic areas in a timely fashion to inform their
management decisions. Furthermore, the release of these datasets will support
numerous avenues of research for computer vision in remote sensing for
agriculture.

					<dc:description>  Direct imaging is an active research topic in astronomy for the detection and
the characterization of young sub-stellar objects. The very high contrast
between the host star and its companions makes the observations particularly
challenging. In this context, post-processing methods combining several images
recorded with the pupil tracking mode of telescope are needed. In previous
works, we have presented a data-driven algorithm, PACO, capturing locally the
spatial correlations of the data with a multi-variate Gaussian model. PACO
delivers better detection sensitivity and confidence than the standard
post-processing methods of the field. However, there is room for improvement
due to the approximate fidelity of the PACO statistical model to the time
evolving observations. In this paper, we propose to combine the statistical
model of PACO with supervised deep learning. The data are first pre-processed
with the PACO framework to improve the stationarity and the contrast. A
convolutional neural network (CNN) is then trained in a supervised fashion to
detect the residual signature of synthetic sources. Finally, the trained
network delivers a detection map. The photometry of detected sources is
estimated by a second CNN. We apply the proposed approach to several datasets
from the VLT/SPHERE instrument. Our results show that its detection stage
performs significantly better than baseline methods (cADI, PCA), and leads to a
contrast improvement up to half a magnitude compared to PACO. The
characterization stage of the proposed method performs on average on par with
or better than the comparative algorithms (PCA, PACO) for angular separation
above 0.5''.

					<dc:description>  Detecting illicit nodes on blockchain networks is a valuable task for
strengthening future regulation. Recent machine learning-based methods proposed
to tackle the tasks are using some blockchain transaction datasets with a small
portion of samples labeled positive and the rest unlabelled (PU). Albeit the
assumption that a random sample of unlabeled nodes are normal nodes is used in
some works, we discuss that the label mechanism assumption for the hidden
positive labels and its effect on the evaluation metrics is worth considering.
We further explore that PU classifiers dealing with potential hidden positive
labels can have improved performance compared to regular machine learning
models. We test the PU classifiers with a list of graph representation learning
methods for obtaining different feature distributions for the same data to have
more reliable results.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for solving
nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDE) via the associated
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). We discretize FPE in space and time using the
Chang-Cooper scheme, and compute the solution of the resulting system of linear
equations using the quantum linear systems algorithm. The Chang-Cooper scheme
is second order accurate and satisfies conservativeness and positivity of the
solution. We present detailed error and complexity analyses that demonstrate
that our proposed quantum scheme, which we call the Quantum Linear Systems
Chang-Cooper Algorithm (QLSCCA), computes the solution to the FPE within
prescribed $\epsilon$ error bounds with polynomial dependence on state
dimension $d$. Classical numerical methods scale exponentially with dimension,
thus, our approach provides an \emph{exponential speed-up} over traditional
approaches.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the creation of dark matter particles as a result of the decay
of the scalar field in the framework of warm inflationary models, by using the
irreversible thermodynamics of open systems with matter creation/annihilation.
We consider the scalar fields, radiation and dark matter as an interacting
three component cosmological fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe, in the presence of the
curvature terms. The thermodynamics of open systems as applied together with
the gravitational field equations to the three component cosmological fluid
leads to a generalization of the elementary scalar field-radiation interaction
model, which is the theoretical basis of warm inflationary models. Moreover,
the decay (creation) pressures describing matter production are explicitly
considered as parts of the cosmological fluid energy-momentum tensor. A
specific theoretical model, describing coherently oscillating scalar waves, is
considered. In particular, we investigate the role of the curvature terms in
the dynamical evolution of the early Universe, by considering numerical
solutions of the gravitational field equations. Our results indicate that
despite the fact that the Universe becomes flat at the end of the inflationary
era, the curvature terms, if present, may still play an important role in the
very first stages of the evolution of the Universe.

					<dc:description>  Robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is an important aspect to consider
for their clinical applications. This work examined robustness issue for a
DNN-based multi-class classification model via comprehensive experimental and
simulation studies. We constructed a DNN-based multi-class classification model
that classifies an axial CT image as one of the four body sites of brain &amp; neck
(BN), chest (C), abdomen &amp; pelvis (AP), and leg &amp; foot (LF). The model was
trained with whole-body CT images of 37 patients each scanned once and 10 scans
of a whole-body phantom with different mAs levels to achieve a F1 score of
99.7% averaged over four classes on a testing dataset. We evaluated robustness
of the model against noise perturbations under different mAs levels using
simulated CT noisy images based on noise power spectrum (NPS) and experimental
CT images acquired in repeated scans of the orange-man phantom. To quantify
robustness of the trained model, we defined Successful Attack Rate (SAR) as the
ratio of predictions changed with noises and Confusion Matrix for Robustness
(CMR) that represents the percentage of a predicted class without noise being
predicted to different classes under noise. Besides, we repeatedly trained the
model for 100 times using exactly the same training procedure, hyper-parameter
settings, as well as the training and validation dataset to investigate
robustness of models due to inherent randomness in the training process.
Finally, to improve model robustness, we employed an adaptive training scheme
and demonstrated its effectiveness. Experimental and numerical studies
demonstrated robustness issue of a DNN-based multi-class classification model.
The discoveries highlight the needs for evaluating and ensuring DNN model
robustness.

					<dc:description>  This research aims to examine the usefulness of integrating various feature
selection methods with regression algorithms for sleep quality prediction. A
publicly accessible sleep quality dataset is used to analyze the effect of
different feature selection techniques on the performance of four regression
algorithms - Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso Regression and Random
Forest Regressor. The results are compared to determine the optimal combination
of feature selection techniques and regression algorithms. The conclusion of
the study enriches the current literature on using machine learning for sleep
quality prediction and has practical significance for personalizing sleep
recommendations for individuals.

					<dc:description>  We study the influence of different activation functions in the output layer
of deep neural network models for soft and hard label prediction in the
learning with disagreement task. In this task, the goal is to quantify the
amount of disagreement via predicting soft labels. To predict the soft labels,
we use BERT-based preprocessors and encoders and vary the activation function
used in the output layer, while keeping other parameters constant. The soft
labels are then used for the hard label prediction. The activation functions
considered are sigmoid as well as a step-function that is added to the model
post-training and a sinusoidal activation function, which is introduced for the
first time in this paper.

					<dc:title>Variational Quantum Classifiers for Natural-Language Text</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Chang, Daniel T.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  As part of the recent research effort on quantum natural language processing
(QNLP), variational quantum sentence classifiers (VQSCs) have been implemented
and supported in lambeq / DisCoPy, based on the DisCoCat model of sentence
meaning. We discuss in some detail VQSCs, including category theory, DisCoCat
for modeling sentence as string diagram, and DisCoPy for encoding string
diagram as parameterized quantum circuit. Many NLP tasks, however, require the
handling of text consisting of multiple sentences, which is not supported in
lambeq / DisCoPy. A good example is sentiment classification of customer
feedback or product review. We discuss three potential approaches to
variational quantum text classifiers (VQTCs), in line with VQSCs. The first is
a weighted bag-of-sentences approach which treats text as a group of
independent sentences with task-specific sentence weighting. The second is a
coreference resolution approach which treats text as a consolidation of its
member sentences with coreferences among them resolved. Both approaches are
based on the DisCoCat model and should be implementable in lambeq / DisCoCat.
The third approach, on the other hand, is based on the DisCoCirc model which
considers both ordering of sentences and interaction of words in composing text
meaning from word and sentence meanings. DisCoCirc makes fundamental
modification of DisCoCat since a sentence in DisCoCirc updates meanings of
words, whereas all meanings are static in DisCoCat. It is not clear if
DisCoCirc can be implemented in lambeq / DisCoCat without breaking DisCoCat.

					<dc:description>  High-dimensional classification is a fundamentally important research problem
in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we derive a nonasymptotic
rate for the minimax excess misclassification risk when feature dimension
exponentially diverges with the sample size and the Bayes classifier possesses
a complicated modular structure. We also show that classifiers based on deep
neural networks can attain the above rate, hence, are minimax optimal.

					<dc:title>Optimization of SpGEMM with Risc-V vector instructions</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  The Sparse GEneral Matrix-Matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) $C = A \times B$ is
a fundamental routine extensively used in domains like machine learning or
graph analytics. Despite its relevance, the efficient execution of SpGEMM on
vector architectures is a relatively unexplored topic. The most recent
algorithm to run SpGEMM on these architectures is based on the SParse
Accumulator (SPA) approach, and it is relatively efficient for sparse matrices
featuring several tens of non-zero coefficients per column as it computes C
columns one by one. However, when dealing with matrices containing just a few
non-zero coefficients per column, the state-of-the-art algorithm is not able to
fully exploit long vector architectures when computing the SpGEMM kernel. To
overcome this issue we propose the SPA paRallel with Sorting (SPARS) algorithm,
which computes in parallel several C columns among other optimizations, and the
HASH algorithm, which uses dynamically sized hash tables to store intermediate
output values. To combine the efficiency of SPA for relatively dense matrix
blocks with the high performance that SPARS and HASH deliver for very sparse
matrix blocks we propose H-SPA(t) and H-HASH(t), which dynamically switch
between different algorithms. H-SPA(t) and H-HASH(t) obtain 1.24$\times$ and
1.57$\times$ average speed-ups with respect to SPA respectively, over a set of
40 sparse matrices obtained from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. For the 22
most sparse matrices, H-SPA(t) and H-HASH(t) deliver 1.42$\times$ and
1.99$\times$ average speed-ups respectively.

					<dc:description>  Studies have shown that modern neural networks tend to be poorly calibrated
due to over-confident predictions. Traditionally, post-processing methods have
been used to calibrate the model after training. In recent years, various
trainable calibration measures have been proposed to incorporate them directly
into the training process. However, these methods all incorporate internal
hyperparameters, and the performance of these calibration objectives relies on
tuning these hyperparameters, incurring more computational costs as the size of
neural networks and datasets become larger. As such, we present Expected
Squared Difference (ESD), a tuning-free (i.e., hyperparameter-free) trainable
calibration objective loss, where we view the calibration error from the
perspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With
extensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and
datasets, we demonstrate that (1) incorporating ESD into the training improves
model calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal
hyperparameter tuning, (2) ESD yields the best-calibrated results compared with
previous approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs
required for calibration during training due to the absence of internal
hyperparameter. The code is publicly accessible at
https://github.com/hee-suk-yoon/ESD.

					<dc:description>  The COVID 19 pandemic has paused many ongoing research projects and unified
researchers' attention to focus on COVID 19 related issues. Our project traces
712294 scientists' publications related to COVID 19 for two years, from January
2020 to December 2021, to detect the dynamic evolution patterns of the COVID 19
collaboration network over time. By studying the collaboration network of COVID
19 scientists, we observe how a new scientific community has been built in
preparation for a sudden shock. The number of newcomers grows incrementally,
and the connectivity of the collaboration network shifts from loose to tight
promptly. Even though every scientist has an equal opportunity to start a
study, collaboration disparity still exists. Following the scale-free
distribution, only a few top authors are highly connected with other authors.
These top authors are more likely to attract newcomers and work with each
other. As the collaboration network evolves, the increase rate in the
probability of attracting newcomers for authors with higher degrees increases,
whereas the increase rates in the likelihood of forming new links among authors
with higher degrees decreases. This highlights the interesting trend that the
COVID pandemic alters the research collaboration trends that star scientists
are starting to collaborate more with newcomers but less with existing
collaborators, which, in a certain way, reduces the collaboration disparity.

					<dc:description>  We consider box-constrained integer programs with objective $g(Wx) + c^T x$,
where $g$ is a &quot;complicated&quot; function with an $m$ dimensional domain. Here we
assume we have $n \gg m$ variables and that $W \in \mathbb Z^{m \times n}$ is
an integer matrix with coefficients of absolute value at most $\Delta$. We
design an algorithm for this problem using only the mild assumption that the
objective can be optimized efficiently when all but $m$ variables are fixed,
yielding a running time of $n^m(m \Delta)^{O(m^2)}$. Moreover, we can avoid the
term $n^m$ in several special cases, in particular when $c = 0$.
  Our approach can be applied in a variety of settings, generalizing several
recent results. An important application are convex objectives of low domain
dimension, where we imply a recent result by Hunkenschr\&quot;oder et al. [SIOPT'22]
for the 0-1-hypercube and sharp or separable convex $g$, assuming $W$ is given
explicitly. By avoiding the direct use of proximity results, which only holds
when $g$ is separable or sharp, we match their running time and generalize it
for arbitrary convex functions. In the case where the objective is only
accessible by an oracle and $W$ is unknown, we further show that their
proximity framework can be implemented in $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^2)}$-time instead
of $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^3)}$. Lastly, we extend the result by Eisenbrand and
Weismantel [SODA'17, TALG'20] for integer programs with few constraints to a
mixed-integer linear program setting where integer variables appear in only a
small number of different constraints.

					<dc:description>  Deep learning image processing models have had remarkable success in recent
years in generating high quality images. Particularly, the Improved Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have shown superiority in image quality
to the state-of-the-art generative models, which motivated us to investigate
its capability in generation of the synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.
In this work, synthetic ECG signals are generated by the Improved DDPM and by
the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGANGP) models and then compared. To
this end, we devise a pipeline to utilize DDPM in its original 2D form. First,
the 1D ECG time series data are embedded into the 2D space, for which we
employed the Gramian Angular Summation/Difference Fields (GASF/GADF) as well as
Markov Transition Fields (MTF) to generate three 2D matrices from each ECG time
series that, which when put together, form a 3-channel 2D datum. Then 2D DDPM
is used to generate 2D 3-channel synthetic ECG images. The 1D ECG signals are
created by de-embedding the 2D generated image files back into the 1D space.
This work focuses on unconditional models and the generation of only Normal ECG
signals, where the Normal class from the MIT BIH Arrhythmia dataset is used as
the training phase. The quality, distribution, and the authenticity of the
generated ECG signals by each model are compared. Our results show that, in the
proposed pipeline, the WGAN-GP model is superior to DDPM by far in all the
considered metrics consistently.

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A common approach to model local neural circuits is to assume random
connectivity. But how is our choice of randomness informed by known network
properties? And how does it affect the network's behavior? Previous approaches
have focused on prescribing increasingly sophisticated statistics of synaptic
strengths and motifs. However, at the same time experimental data on parallel
dynamics of neurons is readily accessible. We therefore propose a complementary
approach, specifying connectivity in the space that directly controls the
dynamics - the space of eigenmodes. We develop a theory for a novel ensemble of
large random matrices, whose eigenvalue distribution can be chosen arbitrarily.
We show analytically how varying such distribution induces a diverse range of
collective network behaviors, including power laws that characterize the
dimensionality, principal components spectrum, autocorrelation, and
autoresponse of neuronal activity. The power-law exponents are controlled by
the density of nearly critical eigenvalues, and provide a minimal and robust
measure to directly link observable dynamics and connectivity. The density of
nearly critical modes also characterizes a transition from high to low
dimensional dynamics, while their maximum oscillation frequency determines a
transition from an exponential to power-law decay in time of the correlation
and response functions. We prove that the wide range of dynamical behaviors
resulting from the proposed connectivity ensemble is caused by structures that
are invisible to a motif analysis. Their presence is captured by motifs
appearing with vanishingly small probability in the number of neurons. Only
reciprocal motifs occur with finite probability. In other words, a motif
analysis can be blind to synaptic structures controlling the dynamics, which
instead become apparent in the space of eigenmode statistics.

and operations akin to composition. Cutting the complements of two such open
along separating twice-punctured disks such that each of the four resulting
handlebodies has positive genus, and gluing a pair of pieces together along the
twice-punctured disks in their boundaries, we show the result is also
hyperbolic. This should be contrasted with composition of any pair of knots in
the 3-sphere, which is never hyperbolic. Similar results are obtained when both
twice-punctured disks are in the same handlebody and we glue a resultant piece
to itself along copies of the twice-punctured disks on its boundary. We include
applications to staked links.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we develop a nanoscale magnetic field sensor based on a
spin-Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) device. We fabricate constriction-based SHNO
devices using Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Au$_{0.25}$Pt$_{0.75}$ bilayer and use them to
demonstrate quasi-DC sensing up to kilohertz-scale frequencies under a bias
field of 400 Oe in the sample plane. The magnetic field sensing is based on the
linear dependence of SHNO oscillation frequency on external magnetic field. The
detectivity of the sensor is as low as 0.21 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ at 100
Hz, with an effective sensing area of 0.32 $\mu$m$^2$, making SHNO devices
suitable for scanning probe nanoscale magnetometry.

					<dc:title>Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Aetiolgy (CKDu)-the search for causes
  and the impact of its politicization</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Tissues and Organs</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) has been identified in many
countries extending from MesoAmerica and Egypt, to South-east Asia and China.
Although CKDu has been linked by various authors to farming, it is an artifact
of treating multi-modal disease distributions as unimodal. There is NO
correlation of CKDu with agriculture since affected farming villages are often
surrounded by other farming villages free of CKDu. Initial studies looked for a
correlation of CKDu with toxic heavy metal residues of arsenic, cadmium etc.,
or herbicides like glyphosate that may be present in the environment, as the
causative factors. There is now considerable consensus that their
concentrations are below danger thresholds, be it in Mesoamerica or south-east
Asia. The conceptual basis of a search for etiology within a systems approach
is discussed, and attempts to name the disease to bias the identification of
its etiology are reviewed. Current research has narrowed down the etiology to
geochemical electrolytic contaminants like fluorides and ionic components in
hard water, nanosilica (found in water as well as in the air), as well as renal
toxins similar to indoxyl sulphates that may arise from interactions of ions
with humic acids contained in aqueous organic matter. However, while
agrochemical toxins are increasingly considered less relevant to the etiology
of CKDu, it has become a firm public belief. In Sri Lanka this has spawned
ideology-based agricultural policies for partial and complete banning of
agrochemicals (2014-2021), followed by some back-tracking, disrupting the
economy and the food supply. A farmer's uprising in 2022 was spawned by poor
harvests. It triggered a larger popular uprising that led to the collapse of a
government wedded to romanticized eco-extremist agricultural policies in a
country already facing difficulties in the wake of Covid and Ukraine.

					<dc:title>GSP = DSP + Boundary Conditions -- The Graph Signal Processing Companion

					<dc:creator>Shi, John</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Moura, Jose M. F.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The paper presents the graph signal processing (GSP) companion model that
naturally replicates the basic tenets of classical signal processing (DSP) for
GSP. The companion model shows that GSP can be made equivalent to DSP 'plus'
appropriate boundary conditions (bc) - this is shown under broad conditions and
holds for arbitrary undirected or directed graphs. This equivalence suggests
how to broaden GSP - extend naturally a DSP concept to the GSP companion model
and then transfer it back to the common graph vertex and graph Fourier domains.
The paper shows that GSP unrolls as two distinct models that coincide in DSP,
the companion model based on (Hadamard or pointwise) powers of what we will
introduce as the spectral frequency vector $\lambda$, and the traditional graph
vertex model, based on the adjacency matrix and its eigenvectors. The paper
expands GSP in several directions, including showing that convolution in the
graph companion model can be achieved with the FFT and that GSP modulation with
appropriate choice of carriers exhibits the DSP translation effect that enables
multiplexing by modulation of graph signals.

					<dc:description>  Despite the steady advancements in nanofabrication made over the past decade
that had prompted a plethora of intriguing applications across various fields,
achieving compatibility between miniaturized photonic devices and electronic
dimensions remains unachievable due to the inherent diffraction limit of
photonic devices. Several approaches have emerged to overcome the diffraction
restriction and leverage the spatial information carried by the evanescent
waves. Negative dielectric permittivity materials can be utilized to build
photonic crystals (PhCs) based on surface plasmon-polaritons. This approach,
however, is known to be exceedingly dissipative, leading to significant optical
losses for photonic components. Herein, we report an approach based on the
anisotropic scaling of the shapes of PhCs to impede the diffraction barrier and
enable a tunable diffraction limit. This approach opens up avenues for
high-frequency wave guiding in cermet configuration, which was previously
unachievable. Furthermore, asymmetric and symmetric dimer network-type PhCs
were explored, with the asymmetric case demonstrating a quasi-bound state in
the continuum with a quality factor of up to 41000.

					<dc:description>  In the fashion domain, there exists a variety of vision-and-language (V+L)
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, text-guided image retrieval,
multi-modal classification, and image captioning. They differ drastically in
each individual input/output format and dataset size. It has been common to
design a task-specific model and fine-tune it independently from a pre-trained
V+L model (e.g., CLIP). This results in parameter inefficiency and inability to
exploit inter-task relatedness. To address such issues, we propose a novel
FAshion-focused Multi-task Efficient learning method for Vision-and-Language
tasks (FAME-ViL) in this work. Compared with existing approaches, FAME-ViL
applies a single model for multiple heterogeneous fashion tasks, therefore
being much more parameter-efficient. It is enabled by two novel components: (1)
a task-versatile architecture with cross-attention adapters and task-specific
adapters integrated into a unified V+L model, and (2) a stable and effective
multi-task training strategy that supports learning from heterogeneous data and
prevents negative transfer. Extensive experiments on four fashion tasks show
that our FAME-ViL can save 61.5% of parameters over alternatives, while
significantly outperforming the conventional independently trained single-task
models. Code is available at https://github.com/BrandonHanx/FAME-ViL.

					<dc:description>  Deep ensembles (DE) have been successful in improving model performance by
learning diverse members via the stochasticity of random initialization. While
recent works have attempted to promote further diversity in DE via
hyperparameters or regularizing loss functions, these methods primarily still
rely on a stochastic approach to explore the hypothesis space. In this work, we
present Multi-Symmetry Ensembles (MSE), a framework for constructing diverse
ensembles by capturing the multiplicity of hypotheses along symmetry axes,
which explore the hypothesis space beyond stochastic perturbations of model
weights and hyperparameters. We leverage recent advances in contrastive
representation learning to create models that separately capture opposing
hypotheses of invariant and equivariant symmetries and present a simple
ensembling approach to efficiently combine appropriate hypotheses for a given
task. We show that MSE effectively captures the multiplicity of conflicting
hypotheses that is often required in large, diverse datasets like ImageNet. As
a result of their inherent diversity, MSE improves classification performance,
uncertainty quantification, and generalization across a series of transfer
tasks.

					<dc:description>  Aims. To provide a schematic mathematical description of the imaging concept
of the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter.
The derived model is the fundamental starting point for both the interpretation
of STIX data and the description of the data calibration process. Methods. We
describe the STIX indirect imaging technique which is based on spatial
modulation of the X-ray photon flux by means of tungsten grids. We show that
each of 30 STIX imaging sub-collimators measures a complex Fourier component of
the flaring X-ray source corresponding to a specific angular frequency. We also
provide details about the count distribution model, which describes the
relationship between the photon flux and the measured pixel counts. Results. We
define the image reconstruction problem for STIX from both visibilities and
photon counts. We provide an overview of the algorithms implemented for the
solution of the imaging problem, and a comparison of the results obtained with
these different methods in the case of the SOL2022-03-31T18 flaring event.

					<dc:description>  Multi-human multi-robot teams have great potential for complex and
large-scale tasks through the collaboration of humans and robots with diverse
capabilities and expertise. To efficiently operate such highly heterogeneous
teams and maximize team performance timely, sophisticated initial task
allocation strategies that consider individual differences across team members
and tasks are required. While existing works have shown promising results in
reallocating tasks based on agent state and performance, the neglect of the
inherent heterogeneity of the team hinders their effectiveness in realistic
scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of the initial task
allocation problem in multi-human multi-robot teams as contextual
multi-attribute decision-make process and propose an attention-based deep
reinforcement learning approach. We introduce a cross-attribute attention
module to encode the latent and complex dependencies of multiple attributes in
the state representation. We conduct a case study in a massive threat
surveillance scenario and demonstrate the strengths of our model.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we first introduce the Riesner-Nordstrom AdS (RN-AdS) black
hole in presence of quintessence and cloud of strings. And then we use the
Restrict Phase Space $(RPS)$ formalism in the corresponding black holes at the
critical point with equation state $\omega_q =-\frac{1}{3},-\frac{2}{3},-1 $.
We take advantage from the central charge and Newton's constant with form of
variable and prove the compatibility between weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and
weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC). Here, we show that when we use the
usual RN-AdS black hole with $\frac{Q}{M}&gt;\sqrt{G}$ condition, we have weak
gravity conjecture. But, in that case, the WCCC is violated by WGC conjecture.
In order to avoid such violation, we consider the Riesner-Nordstrom AdS
(RN-AdS) black hole in the presence of quintessence, quintessence, and cloud
strings. Here, also one can say that, by using the special central charge,
chemical potential, appropriate quintessence, cloud strings parameters, and the
effective Newton's constant with suitable conditions one can arrive the
compatibility between weak gravity conjecture and weak cosmic censorship
conjecture.

					<dc:description>  Cells of diatoms and related algae with complex plastids of red algal origin
are highly compartmentalized. These plastids are surrounded by four envelope
membranes, which also define the periplastidic compartment (PPC), the space
between the second and third membranes. The PPC corresponds to the cytosol of
the eukaryotic alga that was the ancestor of the complex plastid. Metabolic
reactions as well as cell biological processes take place in this compartment;
however, its exact function remains elusive. Automated predictions of protein
locations proved useful for genome wide explorations of metabolism in the case
of plastid proteins, but until now, no automated method for the prediction of
PPC proteins was available. Here, we present an updated version of the plastid
protein predictor ASAFind, which includes optional prediction of PPC proteins.
The new ASAFind version also accepts the output of the most recent versions of
SignalP (5.0) and TargetP (2.0) input data. Furthermore, we release a Python
script to calculate custom scoring matrices for adjustment of the ASAFind
method to other groups of algae, and included the option to run the predictions
with custom scoring matrices in a simplified score cut-off mode.

					<dc:description>  Benefiting from large-scale vision-language pre-training on image-text pairs,
open-world detection methods have shown superior generalization ability under
the zero-shot or few-shot detection settings. However, a pre-defined category
space is still required during the inference stage of existing methods and only
the objects belonging to that space will be predicted. To introduce a &quot;real&quot;
open-world detector, in this paper, we propose a novel method named CapDet to
either predict under a given category list or directly generate the category of
predicted bounding boxes. Specifically, we unify the open-world detection and
dense caption tasks into a single yet effective framework by introducing an
additional dense captioning head to generate the region-grounded captions.
Besides, adding the captioning task will in turn benefit the generalization of
detection performance since the captioning dataset covers more concepts.
Experiment results show that by unifying the dense caption task, our CapDet has
obtained significant performance improvements (e.g., +2.1% mAP on LVIS rare
classes) over the baseline method on LVIS (1203 classes). Besides, our CapDet
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on dense captioning tasks, e.g.,
15.44% mAP on VG V1.2 and 13.98% on the VG-COCO dataset.

					<dc:description>  How do diffusion generative models convert pure noise into meaningful images?
We argue that generation involves first committing to an outline, and then to
finer and finer details. The corresponding reverse diffusion process can be
modeled by dynamics on a (time-dependent) high-dimensional landscape full of
Gaussian-like modes, which makes the following predictions: (i) individual
trajectories tend to be very low-dimensional; (ii) scene elements that vary
more within training data tend to emerge earlier; and (iii) early perturbations
substantially change image content more often than late perturbations. We show
that the behavior of a variety of trained unconditional and conditional
diffusion models like Stable Diffusion is consistent with these predictions.
Finally, we use our theory to search for the latent image manifold of diffusion
models, and propose a new way to generate interpretable image variations. Our
viewpoint suggests generation by GANs and diffusion models have unexpected
similarities.

					<dc:description>  Oblivious routing is a well-studied distributed paradigm that uses static
precomputed routing tables for selecting routing paths within a network.
Existing oblivious routing schemes with polylogarithmic competitive ratio for
general networks are tree-based, in the sense that routing is performed
according to a convex combination of trees. However, this restriction to trees
leads to a construction that has time quadratic in the size of the network and
does not parallelize well.
  In this paper we study oblivious routing schemes based on electrical routing.
In particular, we show that general networks with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges
admit a routing scheme that has competitive ratio $O(\log^2 n)$ and consists of
a convex combination of only $O(\sqrt{m})$ electrical routings. This
immediately leads to an improved construction algorithm with time
$\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ that can also be implemented in parallel with
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$ depth.

					<dc:description>  The emergence of flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene at the magic angle
can be understood in terms of a vanishing Fermi velocity of the Dirac cone.
This is associated with van Hove singularities approaching the Fermi energy and
becoming higher-order. In the density of states this is reflected by flanking
logarithmic van Hove divergences pinching off the central Dirac cone in energy
space. The low-energy pseudogap of the Dirac cone away from the magic angle is
replaced by a power-law divergence due to the higher-order van Hove singularity
at the magic angle.
  This plays an important role in the exotic phenomena observed in this
material, such as superconductivity and magnetism, by amplifying electronic
correlation effects. Here we investigate one such correlation effect -- the
Kondo effect due to a magnetic impurity embedded in twisted bilayer graphene.
We use the Bistritzer-MacDonald model to extract the low-energy density of
states of the material as a function of twist angle, and study the resulting
quantum impurity physics using perturbative and numerical renormalization group
methods. Although at zero temperature the impurity is only Kondo screened
precisely at the magic angle, we find highly nontrivial behavior at finite
temperatures relevant to experiment, due to the complex interplay between
Dirac, van Hove, and Kondo physics.

					<dc:description>  We classify the regular maps $\mathcal M$ which have automorphism groups $G$
acting faithfully and primitively on their vertices. As a permutation group $G$
must be of almost simple or affine type, with dihedral point stabilisers. We
show that all such almost simple groups, namely all but a few groups ${\rm
PSL}_2(q)$, ${\rm PGL}_2(q)$ and ${\rm Sz}(q)$, arise from regular maps, which
are always non-orientable. In the affine case, the maps $\mathcal M$ occur in
orientable and non-orientable Petrie dual pairs. We give the number of maps
associated with each group, together with their genus and extended type. Some
of this builds on earlier work of the first author on generalised Paley maps,
and on recent work of Jajcay, Li, \vSir\'a\vn and Wang on maps with
quasiprimitive automorphism groups. There are tables of data for the maps in
appendices to this paper.

					<dc:description>  Dynamic systems characterized by second-order nonlinear ordinary differential
equations appear in many fields of physics and engineering. To solve these
kinds of problems, time-consuming step-by-step numerical integration methods
and convolution methods based on Volterra series in the time domain have been
widely used. In contrast, this work develops an efficient generalized
pole-residue method based on the Volterra series performed in the Laplace
domain. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are
decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response
related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of
the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a
linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is
how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients.
Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function
of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Unlike
the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to
arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response
and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful
mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems
with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are
investigated. For each system, regular excitations and complex irregular
excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate
the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it
with the fourth-order Runge--Kutta method.

					<dc:description>  Approximate computing (AC) has become a prominent solution to improve the
performance, area, and power/energy efficiency of a digital design at the cost
of output accuracy. We propose a novel scalable approximate multiplier that
utilizes a lookup table-based compensation unit. To improve energy-efficiency,
input operands are truncated to a reduced bitwidth representation (e.g., h
bits) based on their leading one positions. Then, a curve-fitting method is
employed to map the product term to a linear function, and a piecewise constant
error-correction term is used to reduce the approximation error. For computing
the piecewise constant error-compensation term, we partition the function space
into M segments and compute the compensation factor for each segment by
averaging the errors in the segment. The multiplier supports various degrees of
truncation and error-compensation to exploit accuracy-efficiency trade-off. The
proposed approximate multiplier offers better error metrics such as mean and
standard deviation of absolute relative error (MARED and StdARED) compare to a
state-of-the-art integer approximate multiplier. The proposed approximate
multiplier improves the MARED and StdARED by about 38% and 32% when its energy
consumption is about equal to the state-of-the-art approximate multiplier.
Moreover, the performance of the proposed approximate multiplier is evaluated
in image classification applications using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The
results indicate that the degradation of DNN accuracy is negligible especially
due to the compensation properties of our approximate multiplier.

					<dc:description>  We propose a novel way of representing and analysing single-cell genomic
count data, by modelling the observed data count matrix as a network adjacency
matrix. This perspective enables theory from stochastic networks modelling to
be applied in a principled way to this type of data, providing new ways to view
and analyse these data, and giving first-principles theoretical justification
to established, successful methods. We show the success of this approach in the
context of three cell-biological contexts, from the epiblast/epithelial/neural
lineage. New technology has made it possible to gather genomic data from single
cells at unprecedented scale, and this brings with it new challenges to deal
with much higher levels of heterogeneity than expected between individual
cells. Novel, tailored, computational-statistical methodology is needed to make
the most of these new types of data, involving collaboration between
mathematical and biomedical scientists.

					<dc:description>  Silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructures have many important advantages for
hosting spin qubits. However, controlling the energy splitting between the two
low-energy conduction-band valleys remains a critical challenge for scaling up
to large numbers of reliable qubits. Broad distributions of valley splittings
are commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. Such behavior
has previously been attributed to imperfections such as steps at the quantum
well interface. The most common approaches for addressing this problem have
sought to engineer design improvements into the quantum well. In this work, we
develop a simple, universal theory of valley splitting based on the
reciprocal-space profile of the quantum well confinement potential, which
simultaneously explains the effects of steps, wide interfaces, alloy disorder,
and custom heterostructure designs. We use this understanding to characterize
theoretically the valley splitting in a variety of heterostructures, finding
that alloy disorder can explain the observed variability of the valley
splitting, even in the absence of steps. Moreover we show that steps have a
significant effect on the valley splitting only when the top interface is very
sharp. We predict a universal crossover from a regime where low valley
splittings are rare to a regime dominated by alloy disorder, in which valley
splittings can approach zero. We show that many recent experiments fall into
the latter category, with important implications for large-scale qubit
implementations. We finally propose a strategy to suppress the incidence of low
valley splittings by (i) increasing the random alloy disorder (to increase the
valley splitting variance), and then (ii) allowing for electrostatic tuning of
the dot position (to access locations with higher valley splitting).

					<dc:description>  Generalized fractional maps of the orders 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1 are Volterra
difference equations of convolution type with kernels, which differences are
absolutely summable, but the series of kernels are diverging. Commonly used in
applications fractional (with the power-law kernels) and fractional difference
(with the falling factorial kernels) maps of the orders 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1 belong to
this class of maps. We derived the algebraic equations which allow the
calculation of bifurcation points of generalized fractional maps. We calculated
the bifurcation points and drew bifurcation diagrams for the fractional and
fractional difference logistic maps. Although the transition to chaos on
individual trajectories in fractional maps may be characterized by the cascade
of bifurcations type behavior and zero Lyapunov exponents, the results of our
numerical simulations allow us to make a conjecture that the cascade of
bifurcations scenarios of transition to chaos in generalized fractional maps
and regular maps are similar, and the value of the generalized fractional
Feigenbaum constant df is the same as the value of the regular Feigenbaum
constant delta = 4.669....

					<dc:title>Higher-order asymptotic expansions and finite difference schemes for the

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Analysis of PDEs</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose a new asymptotic expansion for the fractional $p$-Laplacian with
precise computations of the errors. Our approximation is shown to hold in the
whole range $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $s\in(0,1)$, with errors that do not
degenerate as $s\to1^-$. These are super-quadratic for a wide range of $p$
(better far from the zero gradient points), and optimal in most cases. One of
the main ideas here is the fact that the singular part of the integral
representation of the fractional $p$-Laplacian behaves like a local
$p$-Laplacian with a weight correction. As a consequence of this, we also
revisit a previous asymptotic expansion for the classical $p$-Laplacian, whose
error orders were not known.
  Based on the previous result, we propose monotone finite difference
approximations of the fractional $p$-Laplacian with explicit weights and we
obtain the error estimates. Finally, we introduce explicit finite difference
schemes for the associated parabolic problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and show that it
is stable, monotone and convergent in the context of viscosity solutions. An
interesting feature is the fact that the stability condition improves with the
regularity of the initial data.

					<dc:description>  The proliferation of sensitive information being stored online highlights the
pressing need for secure and efficient user authentication methods. To address
this issue, this paper presents a novel zero-effort two-factor authentication
(2FA) approach that combines the unique characteristics of a users environment
and Machine Learning (ML) to confirm their identity. Our proposed approach
utilizes Wi-Fi radio wave transmission and ML algorithms to analyze beacon
frame characteristics and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values from
Wi-Fi access points to determine the users location. The aim is to provide a
secure and efficient method of authentication without the need for additional
hardware or software. A prototype was developed using Raspberry Pi devices and
experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of
the proposed approach. Results showed that the proposed system can
significantly enhance the security of sensitive information in various
industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail. This study sheds light on
the potential of Wi-Fi radio waves and RSSI values as a means of user
authentication and the power of ML to identify patterns in wireless signals for
security purposes. The proposed system holds great promise in revolutionizing
the field of 2FA and user authentication, offering a new era of secure and
seamless access to sensitive information.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the MNL-Bandit problem in a non-stationary
environment and present an algorithm with worst-case dynamic regret of
$\tilde{O}\left( \min \left\{ \sqrt{NTL}\;,\;
N^{\frac{1}{3}}(\Delta_{\infty}^{K})^{\frac{1}{3}} T^{\frac{2}{3}} +
\sqrt{NT}\right\}\right)$. Here $N$ is the number of arms, $L$ is the number of
switches and $\Delta_{\infty}^K$ is a variation measure of the unknown
parameters. We also show that our algorithm is near-optimal (up to logarithmic
factors). Our algorithm builds upon the epoch-based algorithm for stationary
MNL-Bandit in Agrawal et al. 2016. However, non-stationarity poses several
challenges and we introduce new techniques and ideas to address these. In
particular, we give a tight characterization for the bias introduced in the
estimators due to non stationarity and derive new concentration bounds.

					<dc:description>  One of the most studied machine learning challenges that recent studies have
shown the susceptibility of deep neural networks to is the class imbalance
problem. While concerted research efforts in this direction have been notable
in recent years, findings have shown that the canonical learning objective,
empirical risk minimization (ERM), is unable to achieve optimal imbalance
learning in deep neural networks given its bias to the majority class. An
alternative learning objective, group distributionally robust optimization
(gDRO), is investigated in this study for imbalance learning, focusing on
tabular imbalanced data as against image data that has dominated deep imbalance
learning research. Contrary to minimizing average per instance loss as in ERM,
gDRO seeks to minimize the worst group loss over the training data.
Experimental findings in comparison with ERM and classical imbalance methods
using four popularly used evaluation metrics in imbalance learning across
several benchmark imbalance binary tabular data of varying imbalance ratios
reveal impressive performance of gDRO, outperforming other compared methods in
terms of g-mean and roc-auc.

					<dc:description>  Recent vision-language models have shown impressive multi-modal generation
capabilities. However, typically they require training huge models on massive
datasets. As a more scalable alternative, we introduce Prismer, a data- and
parameter-efficient vision-language model that leverages an ensemble of domain
experts. Prismer only requires training of a small number of components, with
the majority of network weights inherited from readily-available, pre-trained
domain experts, and kept frozen during training. By leveraging experts from a
wide range of domains, we show that Prismer can efficiently pool this expert
knowledge and adapt it to various vision-language reasoning tasks. In our
experiments, we show that Prismer achieves fine-tuned and few-shot learning
performance which is competitive with current state-of-the-art models, whilst
requiring up to two orders of magnitude less training data. Code is available
at https://github.com/NVlabs/prismer.

					<dc:description>  In the present paper we examine in a systematic way the most relevant
orderings of pure kinetic Hamiltonians for five different position-dependent
mass (PDM) profiles: soliton-like, reciprocal quadratic and biquadratic,
exponential and parabolic. As a result of the non-commutativity between
momentum and position operators, a diversity of effective potentials is
generated. We analyze the whole set and find unexpected coincidences as well as
discrepancies among them. We obtain analytically the full-spectrum of energies
and solutions in the twenty-five cases considered. It is shown how the simple
ordinary constant-mass solutions are transformed into a variety of complex
combinations of transcendental functions and arguments. We find that particles
with a non-uniform mass density can present discrete energy spectra as well as
continuous ones which can be bounded or not. These results are consistent with
the fact that although the external potential is zero, PDM eigenfunctions are
not actual free states but a sort of effective waves in a solid-state sample.
This is precisely the origin of the position-dependent mass. In all the events
we obtain exact complete spectral expressions. Our methodological procedure
thus puts a wide diversity of Hamiltonian seeds on an equal footing in order to
be compared. This allows choosing the better arrangement to model a specific
solid or heterostructure once the spectrum of a given material is
experimentally available. Finally, we perform a one-dimensional model
calculation of a double heterostructure with a parabolic PDM particle in the
interface region. Our study is also indicated for applications inside material
structures with the addition of external potentials.

					<dc:description>  Deep learning has experienced significant growth in recent years, resulting
in increased energy consumption and carbon emission from the use of GPUs for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Answering the call for sustainability,
conventional solutions have attempted to move training jobs to locations or
time frames with lower carbon intensity. However, moving jobs to other
locations may not always be feasible due to large dataset sizes or data
regulations. Moreover, postponing training can negatively impact application
service quality because the DNNs backing the service are not updated in a
timely fashion. In this work, we present a practical solution that reduces the
carbon footprint of DNN training without migrating or postponing jobs.
Specifically, our solution observes real-time carbon intensity shifts during
training and controls the energy consumption of GPUs, thereby reducing carbon
footprint while maintaining training performance. Furthermore, in order to
proactively adapt to shifting carbon intensity, we propose a lightweight
machine learning algorithm that predicts the carbon intensity of the upcoming
time frame. Our solution, Chase, reduces the total carbon footprint of training
ResNet-50 on ImageNet by 13.6% while only increasing training time by 2.5%.

					<dc:description>  Plastid targeted proteins of diatoms and related algae can be predicted with
high sensitivity and specificity using the ASAFind method published in 2015.
ASAFind predictions rely on SignalP predictions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
targeting signal peptides. Recently (in 2019), a new version of SignalP was
released, SignalP 5.0. We tested the ability of SignalP 5.0 to recognize signal
peptides of nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted diatom pre-proteins, and to
identify the signal peptide cleavage site. The results were compared to manual
predictions of the characteristic cleavage site motif, and to previous versions
of SignalP. SignalP 5.0 is less sensitive than the previous versions of SignalP
in this specific task, and also in the detection of signal peptides of
non-plastid proteins in diatoms. However, in combination with ASAFind, the
resulting prediction performance for plastid proteins is high. In addition, we
tested the multi-location prediction tool TargetP for its suitability to
provide signal peptide information to ASAFind. The newest version, TargetP 2.0,
had the highest prediction performances for diatom signal peptides and
mitochondrial transit peptides compared to other versions of SignalP and
TargetP, thus it provides a good basis for ASAFind predictions.

their asymptotic properties are established. Besides, a subsampling Bernstein
version method is investigated and compared with multiplier bootstrap.
Simulation study showed that the Bernstein tests outperform the tests based on
the empirical copula.

					<dc:description>  We address the problem of unambiguous reconstruction of rational functions of
many variables. This is particularly relevant for recovery of exact expansion
coefficients in integration-by-parts identites (IBPs) based on modular
arithmetic. These IBPs are indispensable in modern approaches to evaluation of
multiloop Feynman integrals by means of differential equations. Modular
arithmetic is far more superior to algebraic implementations when one deals
with high-multiplicity situations involving a large number of Lorentz
invariants. We introduce a new method based on balanced relations which allows
one to achieve the goal of a robust functional restoration with minimal data
input. The technique is implemented as a Mathematica package Reconstruction.m
in the FIRE6 environment and thus successfully demonstrates a proof of concept.

					<dc:title>Visual Saliency-Guided Channel Pruning for Deep Visual Detectors in

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Deep neural network (DNN) pruning has become a de facto component for
deploying on resource-constrained devices since it can reduce memory
requirements and computation costs during inference. In particular, channel
pruning gained more popularity due to its structured nature and direct savings
on general hardware. However, most existing pruning approaches utilize
importance measures that are not directly related to the task utility.
Moreover, few in the literature focus on visual detection models. To fill these
gaps, we propose a novel gradient-based saliency measure for visual detection
and use it to guide our channel pruning. Experiments on the KITTI and COCO
traffic datasets demonstrate our pruning method's efficacy and superiority over
state-of-the-art competing approaches. It can even achieve better performance
with fewer parameters than the original model. Our pruning also demonstrates
great potential in handling small-scale objects.

					<dc:description>  Hate speech in social media is a growing phenomenon, and detecting such toxic
content has recently gained significant traction in the research community.
Existing studies have explored fine-tuning language models (LMs) to perform
hate speech detection, and these solutions have yielded significant
performance. However, most of these studies are limited to detecting hate
speech only in English, neglecting the bulk of hateful content that is
generated in other languages, particularly in low-resource languages.
Developing a classifier that captures hate speech and nuances in a low-resource
language with limited data is extremely challenging. To fill the research gap,
we propose HateMAML, a model-agnostic meta-learning-based framework that
effectively performs hate speech detection in low-resource languages. HateMAML
utilizes a self-supervision strategy to overcome the limitation of data
scarcity and produces better LM initialization for fast adaptation to an unseen
target language (i.e., cross-lingual transfer) or other hate speech datasets
(i.e., domain generalization). Extensive experiments are conducted on five
datasets across eight different low-resource languages. The results show that
HateMAML outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by more than 3% in the
cross-domain multilingual transfer setting. We also conduct ablation studies to
analyze the characteristics of HateMAML.

					<dc:description>  Over the past two decades, a desire to reduce transit cost, improve control
over routing and performance, and enhance the quality of experience for users,
has yielded a more densely connected, flat network with fewer hops between
sources and destinations. The shortening of paths in terms of the number of
hops or links has also meant, for what is at the end an infrastructure-bound
network, the lengthening of many of these links. In this paper, we focus on an
important aspect of the evolving logical connectivity of the Internet that has
received little attention to date: intercontinental long-haul links. We develop
a methodology and associated processing system for identifying long haul links
in traceroute measurements. We apply this system to a large corpus of
traceroute data and report on multiple aspects of long haul connectivity
including country-level prevalence, routers as international gateways,
preferred long-haul destinations, and the evolution of these characteristics
over a 7 year period. We identify over 9K layer 3 links that satisfy our
definition for intercontinental long haul with many of them terminating in a
relatively small number of nodes. An analysis of connected components shows a
clearly dominant one with a relative size that remains stable despite a
significant growth of the long-haul infrastructure.

					<dc:description>  We discuss comparatively local versus gauged Weyl symmetry beyond Standard
Model (SM) and Einstein gravity and their geometric interpretation. The SM and
Einstein gravity admit a natural embedding in Weyl integrable geometry which is
a special limit of Weyl conformal (non-metric) geometry. The theory has a {\it
local} Weyl scale symmetry but no associated gauge boson. Unlike previous
models with such symmetry, this embedding is truly minimal i.e. with no
additional fields beyond SM and underlying geometry. This theory is compared to
a similar minimal embedding of SM and Einstein gravity in Weyl conformal
geometry (SMW) which has a full {\it gauged} scale invariance, with an
associated Weyl gauge boson. At large field values, both theories give
realistic, Starobinsky-Higgs like inflation. The broken phase of the current
model is the decoupling limit of the massive Weyl gauge boson of the broken
phase of SMW, while the local scale symmetry of the current model is part of
the larger gauged scale symmetry of SMW. Hence, the current theory has a gauge
embedding in SMW. Unlike in the SMW, we note that in models with local scale
symmetry the associated current is trivial, which is a concern for the physical
meaning of this symmetry. Therefore, the SMW is a more fundamental UV
completion of SM in a full gauge theory of scale invariance that generates
Einstein gravity in the (spontaneously) broken phase, as an effective theory.

					<dc:description>  Accurate detection of arterial input function is a crucial step in obtaining
perfusion hemodynamic parameters using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging. It is required as input for perfusion
quantification and has a great impact on the result of the deconvolution
operation. To improve the reproducibility and reliability of arterial input
function detection, several semi- or fully automatic methods have been
proposed. This study provides an overview of the current state of the field of
arterial input function detection. Methods most commonly used for semi- and
fully automatic arterial input function detection are reviewed, and their
advantages and disadvantages are listed.

					<dc:title>Exploring the impact of Tree Level Higgs Potential on Reheating in f(Q)

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This article investigates the effects of Tree Level Higgs Potential on
reheating in $f(Q)$ gravity. We examine the formalism of tree level inflation
in a modified $f(Q)$ model, finding that the slow roll and e-folds number
during inflation depend on the $f(Q)$ model $\alpha $ parameter. Additionally,
we calculate the reheating as a function of the decay rate, constraining the
inflationary parameters and reheating temperature. Our study reveals that the
Tree Level Higgs Potential influences the reheating temperature and decay rate.
We conclude that increasing the decay rate energy leads to higher reheating
temperature, and the chosen $\alpha$ parameter affects the reheating
temperature curve. This research advances our understanding of the interplay
between Tree Level Higgs inflation, matter production, and modified gravity in
$f(Q)$ gravity.

we propose different integration strategies for the spatial and channel squeeze
and excitation attention mechanism into the baseline U-Net+ResNet neural
network architecture to provide automatic skull-striping i.e., Standard scSE,
scSE-PRE, scSE-POST, and scSE Identity strategies of plugging of scSE block
into the ResNet backbone. We comprehensively investigate the performance of
skull-stripping in T2-star weighted MR images with abnormal brain anatomy. The
comparison that utilizing any of the proposed strategies provides the
robustness of skull-stripping. However, the scSE-POST integration strategy
provides the best result with an average Dice Coefficient of 0.9810.

					<dc:description>  Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) show promise in accurately

higher throughput method of validation. Here, we demonstrate using that MLIPs
and molecular dynamics can accurately capture the potential energy landscape
and lattice dynamics that are needed to describe electron thermal diffuse
scattering. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a test-bed at cryogenic and room temperatures,
we compare electron thermal diffuse scattering simulations using different
approximations to incorporate thermal motion. Only when the simulations are
based on quantum mechanically accurate MLIPs in combination with path-integral
molecular dynamics that include nuclear quantum effects, there is excellent
agreement with experiment\end{abstract}

					<dc:description>  Assistive listening systems (ALSs) dramatically increase speech
intelligibility and reduce listening effort. It is very likely that essentially
everyone, not only individuals with hearing loss, would benefit from the
increased signal-to-noise ratio an ALS provides in almost any listening
scenario. However, ALSs are rarely used by anyone other than people with severe
to profound hearing losses. To date, the reasons for this poor adoption have
not been systematically investigated.
  The authors hypothesize that the reasons for poor adoption of assistive
listening technology include (1) an inability to use personally owned receiving
devices, (2) a lack of high-fidelity stereo sound, (3) receiving devices not
providing an unoccluded listening experience, (4) distortion from alignment
delay and (5) a lack of automatic connectivity to an available assistive
listening audio signal.
  We propose solutions to each of these problems in an effort to pave the way
for mass adoption of assistive listening technology.

					<dc:description>  Flat band systems are currently under intense investigation in quantum
materials, optical lattices, and metamaterials. These efforts are motivated by
potential realization of strongly correlated phenomena enabled by
frustration-induced flat band dispersions; identification of candidate
platforms plays an important role in these efforts. Here, we develop a
high-throughput materials search for bulk crystalline flat bands by automated
construction of uniform-hopping near-neighbor tight binding models. We show
that this approach captures many of the essential features relevant to
identifying flat band lattice motifs in candidate materials in a
computationally inexpensive manner. We apply this algorithm to 139,367
materials in the Materials Project database and identify 63,076 materials that
host at least one flat band elemental sublattice. We further categorize these
candidate systems into at least 31,635 unique flat band crystal nets and
identify candidates of interest from both lattice and band structure
perspectives. This work expands the number of known flat band lattices that
exist in physically realizable crystal structures and classifies the majority
of these systems by the underlying lattice, providing new insights for familiar
(e.g. kagome, pyrochlore, Lieb, and dice) as well as previously unknown motifs.

					<dc:description>  The transient optical sky has remained largely unexplored on very short
timescales. While there have been some experiments searching for optical
transients from minutes to years, none have had the capability to distinguish
millisecond Fast Optical Bursts (FOB). Such very fast transients could be the
optical counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB), the prompt emission from fast
$\gamma$-Ray Bursts (GRB), or other previously unknown phenomena. Here, we
investigate a novel approach to the serendipitous detection of FOBs, which
relies on searching for anomalous spatial images. In particular, due to their
short duration, the seeing distorted images of FOBs should look
characteristically different than those of steady sources in a standard optical
exposure of finite duration. We apply this idea to simulated observations with
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, produced by tracing individual photons through a
turbulent atmosphere, and down through the optics and camera of the Rubin
telescope. We compare these simulated images to steady-source star simulations
in 15 s integrations, the nominal Rubin exposure time. We report the
classification accuracy results of a Neural Network classifier for
distinguishing FOBs from steady sources. From this classifier, we derive
constraints in duration-intensity parameter space for unambiguously identifying
FOBs in Rubin observations. We conclude with estimates of the total number of
detections of FOB counterparts to FRBs expected during the 10-year Rubin Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

					<dc:description>  Graphical chip-firing is a discrete dynamical system where chips are placed
on the vertices of a graph and exchanged via simple firing moves. Recent work
has sought to generalize chip-firing on graphs to higher dimensions, wherein
graphs are replaced by cellular complexes and chip firing becomes
flow-rerouting along the faces of the complex. Given such a system, it is
natural to ask (1) whether this firing process terminates and (2) if it
terminates uniquely (e.g. is confluent). In the graphical case, these questions
were definitively answered by Bjorner--Lovasz--Shor, who developed three
regimes which completely determine if a given system will terminate. Building
on the work of Duval--Klivans--Martin and Felzenszwalb-Klivans, we answer these
questions in a context called flow-firing, where the cellular complexes are
2-dimensional.

					<dc:description>  G351.16+0.70 is a relatively well-studied High Mass Star Forming Region with
at least two main bipolar outflow structures originating from an OB embedded
star and multiple IR cores. Using high-resolution and large bandwidth SMA
observations, we studied its molecular content to probe the emission of iCOMs
which could be related to the bipolar outflows or their jets. We analyzed the
emission spectra in the 1mm band within 8 GHz bandwidth coverage, from 216.75
to 220.75 GHz, and from 228.75 to 232.75 GHz. Employing the LTE approximation
using the XCLASS software, we identified 260 emission lines arising from iCOMs.
The emission lines in the synthetic emission spectra could be explained by 11
iCOMs and 5 molecular isotopologues. Additionally, we analyzed the outstanding
broad iCOM emission lines by using integrated and velocity field maps,
searching for extended emission and velocity gradients related to molecular
outflows. Ro-vibrational transitions of CH$_3$OH, C$_2$H$_3$CN, CH$_3$OCHO,
CH$_3$COCH$_3$, and aGg'-(CH$_2$OH)$_2$ present evidence of extended emission
that does not fit with spherical morphology and that follows the path of the
low-velocity $^{13}$CO outflow. The multiple outflows in the system are
revealed also by the CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) emission, but in particular we have
discovered a so-called extremely high velocity outflow ($|V_{Max}-V_{LSR}|\sim
60$ km s$^{-1}$). Additionally, we provide the full line catalog of iCOMs along
the 8 GHz bandwidth produced by the main protostellar core.

					<dc:description>  Context. Abell 1213, a poor galaxy system, is known to host an anomalous
radio halo detected in VLA data which is an outsider in the relation between
the radio halos power and the X-ray luminosity of the parent clusters. Aims.
Our aim is to analyze the cluster from the optical, X-ray and radio point of
view to characterize the environment of its diffuse radio emission and shed new
light on its nature. Methods. We used optical SDSS data to study the internal
dynamics of the cluster. We also analyzed archival XMM-Newton X-ray data to
unveil the properties of its hot intracluster medium. Finally we used recent
LOFAR data at 144 MHz, together with VLA data at 1.4 GHz, to study the spectral
behavior of the diffuse radio source. Results. Both our optical and X-ray
analysis reveal that this poor, low-mass cluster exhibits a disturbed dynamics.
In fact, it is composed by several galaxy groups, both in the peripheral
regions and, in particular, in the core, where we find evidence of
substructures oriented in direction NE-SW and hints of a merger almost on the
line-of-sight. The analysis of the X-ray emission adds further evidence that
the cluster is in an unrelaxed dynamical state. At radio wavelengths, the LOFAR
data show that the diffuse emission has a size of $\sim$510 kpc. Moreover,
there are hints of low surface brightness emission permeating the cluster
center. Conclusions. The environment of the diffuse radio emission is not what
we expect for a classical halo. The spectral index map of the radio source is
compatible with a relic interpretation, possibly due to a merger in the N-S or
NE-SW direction, in agreement with the substructures detected through the
optical analysis. The fragmented, diffuse radio emissions at the cluster center
could be the surface brightness peaks of a faint central radio halo.

					<dc:description>  In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades
are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into
sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto
1/(i(m-i))$. This article provides an extensive overview of structure theory
and explicit quantitative aspects. There is a canonical embedding into a
continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with
real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. We
show that the family $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete
random leaf and prune&quot; operation. That leads to an explicit inductive
construction of $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases. An accompanying
technical article arXiv:2302.05066 studies in detail (with perhaps surprising
precision) many distributions relating to the heights of leaves, via analytic
methods. We give alternative probabilistic proofs for some such results, which
provides an opportunity for a ``compare and contrast&quot; discussion of the two
methodologies. We prove existence of the limit {\em fringe distribution}
relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the
format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies. We describe
informally the scaling limit process, as a process of splitting the continuous
interval $(0,1)$.
  These topics are somewhat analogous to those topics which have been well
studied in the context of the Brownian continuum random tree. Many open
problems remain.

					<dc:description>  Two-dimensional (2D) indium monoselenide (InSe) has attracted significant
attention as a III-VI two-dimensional semiconductor (2D) with a combination of
favorable attributes from III-V semiconductors as well as van der Waals 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides. Nevertheless, the large-area synthesis of
phase-pure 2D InSe remains unattained due to the complexity of the binary In-Se
system and the difficulties in promoting lateral growth. Here, we report the
first polymorph-selective synthesis of epitaxial 2D InSe by metal-organic
chemical deposition (MOCVD) over 2 inch diameter sapphire wafers. We achieve
thickness-controlled, layer-by-layer epitaxial growth of InSe on c-plane
sapphire via dynamic pulse control of Se/In flux ratio. The layer-by-layer
growth allows thickness control over wafer scale with tunable optical
properties comparable to bulk crystals. Finally, the gate-tunable electrical
transport suggests that MOCVD-grown InSe could be a potential channel material
for back-end-of-line integration in logic transistors with field-effect
mobility comparable to single-crystalline flakes.

algorithms coordinated by a central server. In this paper, we focus on the
decentralized min-max optimization for learning with domain constraints, where
multiple agents collectively solve a nonconvex-strongly-concave min-max saddle
point problem without coordination from any server. Decentralized min-max
optimization problems with domain constraints underpins many important ML
applications, including multi-agent ML fairness assurance, and policy
evaluations in multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithm
called PRECISION (proximal gradient-tracking and stochastic recursive variance
reduction) that enjoys a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, where $T$ is the maximum
number of iterations. To further reduce sample complexity, we propose
PRECISION$^+$ with an adaptive batch size technique. We show that the fast
$O(1/T)$ convergence of PRECISION and PRECISION$^+$ to an $\epsilon$-stationary
point imply $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity and
$O(m\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity, where $m$ is the number of
agents and $n$ is the size of dataset at each agent. To our knowledge, this is
the first work that achieves $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ in both sample and
communication complexities in decentralized min-max learning with domain
constraints. Our experiments also corroborate the theoretical results.

					<dc:title>von Neumann Algebras of Thompson-like Groups from Cloning Systems II</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Bashwinger, Eli</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Operator Algebras</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Group Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Let $(G_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of groups equipped with a
$d$-ary cloning system and denote by $\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$ the resulting
Thompson-like group. In previous work joint with Zaremsky, we obtained
structural results concerning the group von Neumann algebra of
$\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$, denoted by $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$. Under some natural
assumptions on the $d$-ary cloning system, we proved that
$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor. With a few additional
natural assumptions, we proved that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is, moreover, a
McDuff factor. In this paper, we further analyze the structure of
$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, in particular the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq
L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, where $F_d$ is the smallest of the Higman--Thompson
groups. First, we prove that if the $d$-ary cloning system is &quot;diverse&quot;, then
the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is irreducible, a
considerable improvement of the result that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type
$\text{II}_1$ factor. This allows us to compute the normalizer of $L(F_d)$ in
$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, which turns out to be &quot;trivial&quot; in the diverse case,
implying that the inclusion is also singular. Then we prove that the inclusion
$L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ satisfies the weak asymptotic
homomorphism property, which yields another proof that the inclusion is
singular. Finally, we finish the paper with an application: Using
irreducibility, our conditions for when $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type
$\text{II}_1$ McDuff factor, and the fact that $F_d$ is character rigid (in the
sense of Peterson), we prove that the groups $F_d$ are McDuff (in the sense of
Deprez-Vaes).

					<dc:description>  Many standard estimators, when applied to adaptively collected data, fail to
be asymptotically normal, thereby complicating the construction of confidence
intervals. We address this challenge in a semi-parametric context: estimating
the parameter vector of a generalized linear regression model contaminated by a
non-parametric nuisance component. We construct suitably weighted estimating
equations that account for adaptivity in data collection, and provide
conditions under which the associated estimates are asymptotically normal. Our
results characterize the degree of &quot;explorability&quot; required for asymptotic
normality to hold. For the simpler problem of estimating a linear functional,
we provide similar guarantees under much weaker assumptions. We illustrate our
general theory with concrete consequences for various problems, including
standard linear bandits and sparse generalized bandits, and compare with other
methods via simulation studies.

					<dc:description>  Active learning is perhaps most naturally posed as an online learning
problem. However, prior active learning approaches with deep neural networks
assume offline access to the entire dataset ahead of time. This paper proposes
VeSSAL, a new algorithm for batch active learning with deep neural networks in
streaming settings, which samples groups of points to query for labels at the
moment they are encountered. Our approach trades off between uncertainty and
diversity of queried samples to match a desired query rate without requiring
any hand-tuned hyperparameters. Altogether, we expand the applicability of deep
neural networks to realistic active learning scenarios, such as applications
relevant to HCI and large, fractured datasets.

					<dc:description>  Causal abstraction is a promising theoretical framework for explainable
artificial intelligence that defines when an interpretable high-level causal
model is a faithful simplification of a low-level deep learning system.
However, existing causal abstraction methods have two major limitations: they
require a brute-force search over alignments between the high-level model and
the low-level one, and they presuppose that variables in the high-level model
will align with disjoint sets of neurons in the low-level one. In this paper,
we present distributed alignment search (DAS), which overcomes these
limitations. In DAS, we find the alignment between high-level and low-level
models using gradient descent rather than conducting a brute-force search, and
we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles by analyzing
representations in non-standard bases-distributed representations. Our
experiments show that DAS can discover internal structure that prior approaches
miss. Overall, DAS removes previous obstacles to conducting causal abstraction
analyses and allows us to find conceptual structure in trained neural nets.

					<dc:description>  We study the properties of elections that have a given position matrix (in
such elections each candidate is ranked on each position by a number of voters
specified in the matrix). We show that counting elections that generate a given
position matrix is #P-complete. Consequently, sampling such elections uniformly
at random seems challenging and we propose a simpler algorithm, without hard
guarantees. Next, we consider the problem of testing if a given matrix can be
implemented by an election with a certain structure (such as single-peakedness
or group-separability). Finally, we consider the problem of checking if a given
position matrix can be implemented by an election with a Condorcet winner. We
complement our theoretical findings with experiments.

					<dc:description>  Rare-earth silicates are the current standard material for use as
environmental barrier coatings for SiC-based ceramic matrix composites as
hot-section components in gas-turbine engines. Expanding the design space to
all available rare-earth elements to facilitate optimizing functionality
requires an understanding of systematic trends in $RE_2$Si$_2$O$_7$ properties.
In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with experimental
measurements of Young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal
conductivity for a range of different $RE_2$Si$_2$O$_7$ compositions and
phases. Clear trends are observed in these properties as a function of the
radius of the rare-earth cation. In the case of Young's modulus and thermal
expansion, these trends also hold for multi-component systems; while the
thermal conductivity of multi-component systems is noticeably lower, indicating
the potential of such materials to also act as thermal barriers. These results
provide design rules for developing new thermal and environmental barrier
coatings with stiffness and thermal expansion engineered to match that of the
substrate, while simultaneously having reduced thermal conductivity.

					<dc:subject>28A12, 37A05</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The objective of this paper is to characterize the structure of the set
$\Theta$ for a continuous ergodic upper probability
$\mathbb{V}=\sup_{P\in\Theta}P$ (Theorem \ref {main result}):
  . $\Theta$ contains a finite number of ergodic probabilities;
  . Any invariant probability in $\Theta$ is a convex combination of those
ergodic ones in $\Theta$;
  . Any probability in $\Theta$ coincides with an invariant one in $\Theta$ on
the invariant $\sigma$-algebra. The last property has already been obtained in
\textsl{Cerreia-Vioglio, Maccheroni, and Marinacci} \cite{ergodictheorem},
which firstly studied the ergodicity of such capacities.
  As an application of the characterization, we prove an ergodicity result
(Theorem \ref {improve}), which improves the result in \cite{ergodictheorem} in
the sense that the limit of the time mean of $\xi$ is bounded by the upper
expectation $\sup_{P\in\Theta}E_P[\xi]$, instead of the Choquet integral.
Generally, the former is strictly smaller.

					<dc:description>  Nonsmooth dynamic behaviour of systems containing multiple contact points is
an interesting topic. Accurately simulating the repeated
nonsmooth/discontinuous dynamic behaviour is challenging. This study presents a
new numerical approach for solving nonsmooth friction-induced vibration or
friction-involved vibration (FIV) problems by using the physics-informed neural
network (PINN). The neural network training is guided by physics laws or
governing equations. Four kinds of high-accuracy PINN-based methods are
proposed: (1) single PINN; (2) dual PINN; (3) advanced single PINN; (4)
advanced dual PINN. The single PINN uses the nonsmooth dynamic formulations for
multibody systems as physical constraints, which is able to substitute the time
iteration method in the conventional dynamic analysis. For the dual PINN
strategy, in conjunction with the single PINN, a new PINN is proposed as an
alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving the linear
complementary problems (LCP). The advanced single/dual PINN approaches improve
the corresponding single/dual PINN frameworks by incorporating an interpolation
technique during the training process. The success of the proposed PINN
frameworks in predicting the nonlinear vibration of two typical nonsmooth
dynamics problems are verified: one is a 1-dimensional system with direct rigid
contact considering stick-slip oscillation, and the other is a 2-dimensional
system with spring contact considering separation-reattachment and stick-slip
oscillation. Overall, the developed PINN frameworks are accurate in predicting
the nonsmooth dynamic behaviour, which do not require a tiny time step like the
conventional time-stepping methods.

					<dc:description>  Hardware heterogeneity is here to stay for high-performance computing.
Large-scale systems are currently equipped with multiple GPU accelerators per
compute node and are expected to incorporate more specialized hardware. This
shift in the computing ecosystem offers many opportunities for performance
improvement; however, it also increases the complexity of programming for such
architectures. This work introduces a runtime framework that enables effortless
programming for heterogeneous systems while efficiently utilizing hardware
resources. The framework is integrated within a distributed and scalable
runtime system to facilitate performance portability across heterogeneous
nodes. Along with the design, this paper describes the implementation and
optimizations performed, achieving up to 300% improvement on a single device
and linear scalability on a node equipped with four GPUs. The framework in a
distributed memory environment offers portable abstractions that enable
efficient inter-node communication among devices with varying capabilities. It
delivers superior performance compared to MPI+CUDA by up to 20% for large
messages while keeping the overheads for small messages within 10%.
Furthermore, the results of our performance evaluation in a distributed Jacobi
proxy application demonstrate that our software imposes minimal overhead and
achieves a performance improvement of up to 40%. This is accomplished by
utilizing the optimizations mentioned earlier, as well as implementing
over-decomposition in a manner that ensures performance portability.

					<dc:description>  We derive new integrals for $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}\times\mathrm{GL}_k$ from the
generalized doubling method of Cai, Friedberg, Ginzburg and Kaplan for any
positive even integer $n$ and any positive integer $k$, following a strategy
and extending a previous result of Ginzburg and Soudry. We show that these new
integrals unfold to non-unique models on $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}$. When $k$ divides
$n$, we carry out the unramified computation and show that these integrals
represent the tensor product $L$-function for
$\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}\times\mathrm{GL}_k$ via the New Way method, generalizing a
previous result of the second-named author on
$\mathrm{Sp}_{4}\times\mathrm{GL}_2$.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, REST API fuzzing has emerged to explore errors on a cloud
service. Its performance highly depends on the sequence construction and
request generation. However, existing REST API fuzzers have trouble generating
long sequences with well-constructed requests to trigger hard-to-reach states
in a cloud service, which limits their performance of finding deep errors and
security bugs. Further, they cannot find the specific errors caused by using
undefined parameters during request generation. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel hybrid data-driven solution, named MINER, with three new
designs working together to address the above limitations. First, MINER
collects the valid sequences whose requests pass the cloud service's checking
as the templates, and assigns more executions to long sequence templates.
Second, to improve the generation quality of requests in a sequence template,
MINER creatively leverages the state-of-the-art neural network model to predict
key request parameters and provide them with appropriate parameter values.
Third, MINER implements a new data-driven security rule checker to capture the
new kind of errors caused by undefined parameters. We evaluate MINER against
the state-of-the-art fuzzer RESTler on GitLab, Bugzilla, and WordPress via 11
REST APIs. The results demonstrate that the average pass rate of MINER is
23.42% higher than RESTler. MINER finds 97.54% more unique errors than RESTler
on average and 142.86% more reproducible errors after manual analysis. We have
reported all the newly found errors, and 7 of them have been confirmed as logic
bugs by the corresponding vendors.

					<dc:description>  Although telepresence assistive robots have made significant progress, they
still lack the sense of realism and physical presence of the remote operator.
This results in a lack of trust and adoption of such robots. In this paper, we
introduce an Avatar Robot System which is a mixed real/virtual robotic system
that physically interacts with a person in proximity of the robot. The robot
structure is overlaid with the 3D model of the remote caregiver and visualized
through Augmented Reality (AR). In this way, the person receives haptic
feedback as the robot touches him/her. We further present an Optimal
Non-Iterative Alignment solver that solves for the optimally aligned pose of 3D
Human model to the robot (shoulder to the wrist non-iteratively). The proposed
alignment solver is stateless, achieves optimal alignment and faster than the
baseline solvers (demonstrated in our evaluations). We also propose an
evaluation framework that quantifies the alignment quality of the solvers
through multifaceted metrics. We show that our solver can consistently produce
poses with similar or superior alignments as IK-based baselines without their
potential drawbacks.

					<dc:title>Composing Mood Board with User Feedback in Concept Space</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Sano, Shin</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose the Mood Board Composer (MBC), which supports concept designers in
retrieving and composing images on a 2-D concept space to communicate design
concepts. The MBC allows users to iterate adaptive image retrievals
intuitively. Our new contribution to the mood board tool is to adapt the query
vector for the next iteration according to the user's rearrangement of images
on the 2-D space. The algorithm emphasizes the meaning of the labels on the x-
and y-axes by calculating the mean vector of the images on the mood board
multiplied by the weights assigned to each cell of the 3 x 3 grid. The next
image search is performed by obtaining the most similar words from the mean
vector thus obtained and using them as a new query. In addition to the
algorithm described above, we conducted the participant experiment with two
other interaction algorithms to compare. The first allows users to delete
unwanted images and go on to the next searches. The second utilizes the
semantic labels on each image, on which users can provide negative feedback for
query modification for the next searches. Although we did not observe
significant differences among the three proposed algorithms, our experiment
with 420 cases of mood board creation confirmed the effectiveness of adaptive
iterations by the Creativity Support Index (CSI) score.

					<dc:description>  Let $H$ be a graph possibly with loops and $G$ be a multigraph without loops.
An $H$-coloring of $G$ is a function $c: E(G) \rightarrow V(H)$. We will say
that $G$ is an $H$-colored multigraph, whenever we are taking a fixed
$H$-coloring of $G$. The set of all the edges with end vertices $u$ and $v$
will be denoted by $E_{uv}$. We will say that $W=(v_0,e_0^1, \ldots,
e_0^{k_0},v_1,e_1^1,\ldots,e_1^{k_1},v_2,\ldots,v_{n-1},e_{n-1}^1,\ldots,e_{n-1}^{k_{n-1}},v_n)$,
where for each $i$ in $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$, $k_i \geq 1$ and $e_i^j \in
E_{v_iv_{i+1}}$ for every $j \in \{1,\ldots, k_i \}$, is a dynamic $H$-walk iff
$c(e_i^{k_i})c(e_{i+1}^1)$ is an edge in $H$, for each $i \in
\{0,\ldots,n-2\}$. We will say that a dynamic $H$-walk is a closed dynamic
$H$-walk whenever $v_0=v_n$ and $c(e_{n-1}^{k_{n-1}})c(e_0^1)$ is an edge in
$H$. Moreover, a closed dynamic $H$-walk is called dynamic $H$-cycle whenever
$v_i\neq v_j$, for every $\{i,j\}\subseteq \{0,\ldots,v_{n-1}\}$. In
particular, a dynamic $H$-walk is an $H$-walk whenever $k_i=1$, for every $i
\in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$, and when $H$ is a complete graph without loops, an
$H$-walk is well known as a properly colored walk.
  In this work, we study the existence and length of dynamic $H$-cycles,
dynamic $H$-trails and dynamic $H$-paths in $H$-colored multigraphs. To
accomplish this, we introduce a new concept of color degree, namely, the
\textit{dynamic degree}, which allows us to extend some classic results, as
Ore's Theorem, for $H$-colored multigraphs. Also, we give sufficient conditions
for the existence of hamiltonian dynamic $H$-cycles in $H$-colored multigraphs,
and as a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of
properly colored hamiltonian cycle in edge-colored multigraphs, with at least
$c\geq 3$ colors.

					<dc:description>  Connection matrices are a generalization of Morse boundary operators from the
classical Morse theory for gradient vector fields. Developing an efficient
computational framework for connection matrices is particularly important in
the context of a rapidly growing data science that requires new mathematical
tools for discrete data. Toward this goal, the classical theory for connection
matrices has been adapted to combinatorial frameworks that facilitate
computation. We develop an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute a
connection matrix from a given combinatorial (multi) vector field on a
simplicial complex. This algorithm requires a single-pass, improving upon a
known algorithm that runs an implicit recursion executing two-passes at each
level. Overall, the new algorithm is more simple, direct, and efficient than
the state-of-the-art. Because of the algorithm's similarity to the persistence
algorithm, one may take advantage of various software optimizations from
topological data analysis.

					<dc:description>  Social media has emerged as a significant source of information for people.
As agents interact with each other through social media platforms, they create
numerous complex social networks. Within these networks, information spread
among agents and their opinions may be altered by their neighbors' influence.
This paper explores opinion dynamics on social networks, which are influenced
by complex network structure, confirmation bias, and specific issues discussed.
We propose a novel model based on previous models to simulate how public
opinion evolves from consensus to radicalization and to polarization. We also
analyze how agents change their stance under their neighbors' impact. Our model
reveals the emergence of opinion groups and shows how different factors affect
opinion dynamics. This paper contributes to the understanding of opinion
dynamics on social networks and their possible applications in finance,
marketing, politics, and social media.

					<dc:description>  Training deep neural networks (DNNs) takes signifcant time and resources. A
practice for expedited deployment is to use pre-trained deep neural networks
(PTNNs), often from model zoos -- collections of PTNNs; yet, the reliability of
model zoos remains unexamined. In the absence of an industry standard for the
implementation and performance of PTNNs, engineers cannot confidently
incorporate them into production systems. As a first step, discovering
potential discrepancies between PTNNs across model zoos would reveal a threat
to model zoo reliability. Prior works indicated existing variances in deep
learning systems in terms of accuracy. However, broader measures of reliability
for PTNNs from model zoos are unexplored. This work measures notable
discrepancies between accuracy, latency, and architecture of 36 PTNNs across
four model zoos. Among the top 10 discrepancies, we find differences of
1.23%-2.62% in accuracy and 9%-131% in latency. We also fnd mismatches in
architecture for well-known DNN architectures (e.g., ResNet and AlexNet). Our
findings call for future works on empirical validation, automated tools for
measurement, and best practices for implementation.

					<dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being adopted as components in software
systems. Creating and specializing DNNs from scratch has grown increasingly
difficult as state-of-the-art architectures grow more complex. Following the
path of traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers have begun
to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and fine-tune these models for
downstream tasks. Prior works have studied reuse practices for traditional
software packages to guide software engineers towards better package
maintenance and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of
knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems.
  In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of PTM reuse. We
interviewed 12 practitioners from the most popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face,
to learn the practices and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model
the decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified practices,
we describe useful attributes for model reuse, including provenance,
reproducibility, and portability. Three challenges for PTM reuse are missing
attributes, discrepancies between claimed and actual performance, and model
risks. We substantiate these identified challenges with systematic measurements
in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs future directions on optimizing
deep learning ecosystems by automated measuring useful attributes and potential
attacks, and envision future research on infrastructure and standardization for
model registries.

					<dc:description>  Unextendible product bases (UPBs) play a key role in the study of quantum
entanglement and nonlocality. A famous open question is whether there exist
genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), namely multipartite product bases
that are unextendible with respect to every possible bipartition. Here we shed
light on this question by providing a characterization of UPBs and GUPBs in
terms of orthogonality graphs. Building on this connection, we develop a method
for constructing UPBs in low dimensions, and we derive a lower bound on the
size of any GUPB, significantly improving over the state of the art. Moreover,
we show that every minimal GUPB saturating our bound must be associated to
regular graphs. Finally, we discuss a possible path towards the construction of
a minimal GUPB in a tripartite system of minimal local dimension.

					<dc:description>  Transport map methods offer a powerful statistical learning tool that can
couple a target high-dimensional random variable with some reference random
variable using invertible transformations. This paper presents new
computational techniques for building the Knothe--Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement
based on general separable functions. We first introduce a new construction of
the KR rearrangement -- with guaranteed invertibility in its numerical
implementation -- based on approximating the density of the target random
variable using tensor-product spectral polynomials and downward closed sparse
index sets. Compared to other constructions of KR arrangements based on either
multi-linear approximations or nonlinear optimizations, our new construction
only relies on a weighted least square approximation procedure. Then, inspired
by the recently developed deep tensor trains (Cui and Dolgov, Found. Comput.
Math. 22:1863--1922, 2022), we enhance the approximation power of sparse
polynomials by preconditioning the density approximation problem using
compositions of maps. This is particularly suitable for high-dimensional and
concentrated probability densities commonly seen in many applications. We
approximate the complicated target density by a composition of self-reinforced
KR rearrangements, in which previously constructed KR rearrangements -- based
on the same approximation ansatz -- are used to precondition the density
approximation problem for building each new KR rearrangement. We demonstrate
the efficiency of our proposed methods and the importance of using the
composite map on several inverse problems governed by ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).

					<dc:description>  Regular expressions (regexes) are a powerful mechanism for solving
string-matching problems. They are supported by all modern programming
languages, and have been estimated to appear in more than a third of Python and
JavaScript projects. Yet existing studies have focused mostly on one aspect of
regex programming: readability. We know little about how developers perceive
and program regexes, nor the difficulties that they face.
  In this paper, we provide the first study of the regex development cycle,
with a focus on (1) how developers make decisions throughout the process, (2)
what difficulties they face, and (3) how aware they are about serious risks
involved in programming regexes. We took a mixed-methods approach, surveying
279 professional developers from a diversity of backgrounds (including top tech
firms) for a high-level perspective, and interviewing 17 developers to learn
the details about the difficulties that they face and the solutions that they
prefer.
  In brief, regexes are hard. Not only are they hard to read, our participants
said that they are hard to search for, hard to validate, and hard to document.
They are also hard to master: the majority of our studied developers were
unaware of critical security risks that can occur when using regexes, and those
who knew of the risks did not deal with them in effective manners. Our findings
provide multiple implications for future work, including semantic regex search
engines for regex reuse and improved input generators for regex validation.

					<dc:description>  In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), agents are often tasked with
solving a variety of problems differing only in their reward functions. In
order to quickly obtain solutions to unseen problems with new reward functions,
a popular approach involves functional composition of previously solved tasks.
However, previous work using such functional composition has primarily focused
on specific instances of composition functions whose limiting assumptions allow
for exact zero-shot composition. Our work unifies these examples and provides a
more general framework for compositionality in both standard and
entropy-regularized RL. We find that, for a broad class of functions, the
optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related to the known
primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities
relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the
primitive tasks. We also show that the regret of using a zero-shot policy can
be bounded for this class of functions. The derived bounds can be used to
develop clipping approaches for reducing uncertainty during training, allowing
agents to quickly adapt to new tasks.

					<dc:description>  We provide evidence of strongly confined coherent acoustic phonons inside
high quality factor phononic cavities that exhibit tailoredphonon potentials.
Using GaAs/AlAs quasiperiodic superlattices, these functional phonon potentials
are realized by adiabatically changing the layer thicknesses along the growth
direction. Room temperature ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy reveals discrete
phonon levels in the range of $\approx 96-101$ GHz. Additionally, we confirm
that phononic cavities significantly retard the energy loss rate of the
photoexcited carriers as evidenced by time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements. These results highlight the potential of opto-phononic devices
that can bridge the divide between phononics and optoelectronics by
concurrently engineering electronic and phononic properties.

					<dc:description>  The volume of open-source biomedical data has been essential to the
development of various spheres of the healthcare community since more `free'
data can provide individual researchers more chances to contribute. However,
institutions often hesitate to share their data with the public due to the risk
of data exploitation by unauthorized third parties for another commercial usage
(e.g., training AI models). This phenomenon might hinder the development of the
whole healthcare research community. To address this concern, we propose a
novel approach termed `unlearnable biomedical image' for protecting biomedical
data by injecting imperceptible but delusive noises into the data, making them
unexploitable for AI models. We formulate the problem as a bi-level
optimization and propose three kinds of anti-learning perturbation generation
approaches to solve the problem. Our method is an important step toward
encouraging more institutions to contribute their data for the long-term
development of the research community.

					<dc:description>  A novel method, named Curvature-Augmented Manifold Embedding and Learning
(CAMEL), is proposed for high dimensional data classification, dimension
reduction, and visualization. CAMEL utilizes a topology metric defined on the
Riemannian manifold, and a unique Riemannian metric for both distance and
curvature to enhance its expressibility. The method also employs a smooth
partition of unity operator on the Riemannian manifold to convert localized
orthogonal projection to global embedding, which captures both the overall
topological structure and local similarity simultaneously. The local orthogonal
vectors provide a physical interpretation of the significant characteristics of
clusters. Therefore, CAMEL not only provides a low-dimensional embedding but
also interprets the physics behind this embedding. CAMEL has been evaluated on
various benchmark datasets and has shown to outperform state-of-the-art
methods, especially for high-dimensional datasets. The method's distinct
benefits are its high expressibility, interpretability, and scalability. The
paper provides a detailed discussion on Riemannian distance and curvature
metrics, physical interpretability, hyperparameter effect, manifold stability,
and computational efficiency for a holistic understanding of CAMEL. Finally,
the paper presents the limitations and future work of CAMEL along with key
conclusions.

					<dc:description>  Recently, with the development of deep learning, a number of Just Noticeable
Difference (JND) datasets have been built for JND modeling. However, all the
existing JND datasets only label the JND points based on the level of
compression distortion. Hence, JND models learned from such datasets can only
be used for image/video compression. As known, JND is a major characteristic of
the human visual system (HVS), which reflects the maximum visual distortion
that the HVS can tolerate. Hence, a generalized JND modeling should take more
kinds of distortion types into account. To benefit JND modeling, this work
establishes a generalized JND dataset with a coarse-to-fine JND selection,
which contains 106 source images and 1,642 JND maps, covering 25 distortion
types. To this end, we proposed a coarse JND candidate selection scheme to
select the distorted images from the existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
datasets as JND candidates instead of generating JND maps ourselves. Then, a
fine JND selection is carried out on the JND candidates with a crowdsourced
subjective assessment.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for explainability in financial analysis
by utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient to establish a relationship
between aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices. The proposed
methodology involves constructing an aspect list from financial news articles
and analyzing sentiment intensity scores for each aspect. These scores are then
compared to the stock prices for the relevant companies using the Pearson
coefficient to determine any significant correlations. The results indicate
that the proposed approach provides a more detailed and accurate understanding
of the relationship between sentiment analysis and stock prices, which can be
useful for investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.
Additionally, this methodology offers a transparent and interpretable way to
explain the sentiment analysis results and their impact on stock prices.
Overall, the findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of
explainability in financial analysis and highlight the potential benefits of
utilizing the Pearson coefficient for analyzing aspect-based sentiment analysis
and stock prices. The proposed approach offers a valuable tool for
understanding the complex relationships between financial news sentiment and
stock prices, providing a new perspective on the financial market and aiding in
making informed investment decisions.

					<dc:description>  For singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems, supercloseness
analysis of finite element method is still open on Bakhvalov-type meshes,
especially in the case of 2D. The difficulties arise from the width of the mesh
in the layer adjacent to the transition point, resulting in a suboptimal
estimate for convergence. Existing analysis techniques cannot handle these
difficulties well. To fill this gap, a novel interpolation is designed
delicately for the first time for the smooth part of the solution, bringing
about the optimal supercloseness result of almost order 2 under an energy norm
for finite element method. Our theoretical result is uniformly in the singular
perturbation parameter and is supported by the numerical experiments.

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Materials Science</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Materials with a large magnetocaloric response are highly desirable for
magnetic cooling applications. It is suggested that a strong spin-lattice
coupling tends to generate a large magnetocaloric effect, but no microscopic
mechanism has been proposed. In this work, we use spin lattice dynamics
simulation to examine the lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy
change in bcc iron (Fe) and hcp gadolinium (Gd) with exchange interaction
parameters determined from ab initio calculations. We find that indirect
Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction in hcp Gd leads to
longer range spin lattice coupling and more strongly influences the low
frequency long wavelength phonons. This results in a higher lattice
contribution towards the total magnetocaloric entropy change as compared to bcc
Fe with short range direct exchange interactions. Our analysis provides a
framework for understanding the magnetocaloric effect in magnetic materials
with strong spin lattice couplings. Our finding suggests that long range
indirect RKKY type exchange gives rise to a larger lattice contribution to the
magnetocaloric entropy change and is, thus, beneficial for magnetocaloric

					<dc:description>  In various practical situations, matrix factorization methods suffer from
poor data quality, such as high data sparsity and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). Here we consider a matrix factorization problem by utilizing auxiliary
information, which is massively available in real applications, to overcome the
challenges caused by poor data quality. Unlike existing methods that mainly
rely on simple linear models to combine auxiliary information with the main
data matrix, we propose to integrate gradient boosted trees in the
probabilistic matrix factorization framework to effectively leverage auxiliary
information (MFAI). Thus, MFAI naturally inherits several salient features of
gradient boosted trees, such as the capability of flexibly modeling nonlinear
relationships, and robustness to irrelevant features and missing values in
auxiliary information. The parameters in MAFI can be automatically determined
under the empirical Bayes framework, making it adaptive to the utilization of
auxiliary information and immune to overfitting. Moreover, MFAI is
computationally efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets by exploiting
variational inference. We demonstrate the advantages of MFAI through
comprehensive numerical results from simulation studies and real data analysis.
Our approach is implemented in the R package mfair available at
https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/mfair.

					<dc:description>  Carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF), also known as CRLF injection is a
type of vulnerability that allows a hacker to enter special characters into a
web application, altering its operation or confusing the administrator. Log
poisoning and HTTP response splitting are two prominent harmful uses of this
technique. Additionally, CRLF injection can be used by an attacker to exploit
other vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). According to Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP), CRLF vulnerabilities are among the
top 10 vulnerabilities and are a type of injection attack. Automated testing
can help to quickly identify CRLF vulnerabilities, and is particularly useful
for companies to test their applications before releasing them. However, CRLF
vulnerabilities foster a better approach to mitigate CRLF vulnerabilities in
the early stage and help secure applications against high-risk known
vulnerabilities. There has been less research on CRLF vulnerabilities and how
to detect them with automated testing. There is room for further research to be
done on this subject matter in order to develop creative solutions to problems.
It will also help to reduce false positive alerts by checking the header
response of each request. Security automation is an important issue for
companies trying to protect themselves against security threats. Automated
alerts from security systems can provide a quicker and more accurate
understanding of potential vulnerabilities and can help to reduce false
positive alerts. Despite the extensive research on various types of
vulnerabilities in web applications, CRLF vulnerabilities have only recently
been included in the research. Utilizing automated testing as a recurring task
can assist companies in receiving consistent updates about their systems and
enhance their security.

					<dc:description>  While the use of graph-structured data in various fields is becoming
increasingly popular, it also raises concerns about the potential unauthorized
exploitation of personal data for training commercial graph neural network
(GNN) models, which can compromise privacy. To address this issue, we propose a
novel method for generating unlearnable graph examples. By injecting delusive
but imperceptible noise into graphs using our Error-Minimizing Structural
Poisoning (EMinS) module, we are able to make the graphs unexploitable.
Notably, by modifying only $5\%$ at most of the potential edges in the graph
data, our method successfully decreases the accuracy from ${77.33\%}$ to
${42.47\%}$ on the COLLAB dataset.

					<dc:description>  Offline imitation learning (IL) promises the ability to learn performant
policies from pre-collected demonstrations without interactions with the
environment. However, imitating behaviors fully offline typically requires
numerous expert data. To tackle this issue, we study the setting where we have
limited expert data and supplementary suboptimal data. In this case, a
well-known issue is the distribution shift between the learned policy and the
behavior policy that collects the offline data. Prior works mitigate this issue
by regularizing the KL divergence between the stationary state-action
distributions of the learned policy and the behavior policy. We argue that such
constraints based on exact distribution matching can be overly conservative and
hamper policy learning, especially when the imperfect offline data is highly
suboptimal. To resolve this issue, we present RelaxDICE, which employs an
asymmetrically-relaxed f-divergence for explicit support regularization.
Specifically, instead of driving the learned policy to exactly match the
behavior policy, we impose little penalty whenever the density ratio between
their stationary state-action distributions is upper bounded by a constant.
Note that such formulation leads to a nested min-max optimization problem,
which causes instability in practice. RelaxDICE addresses this challenge by
supporting a closed-form solution for the inner maximization problem. Extensive
empirical study shows that our method significantly outperforms the best prior
offline IL method in six standard continuous control environments with over 30%
performance gain on average, across 22 settings where the imperfect dataset is
highly suboptimal.

					<dc:description>  Rich Electronic Health Records (EHR), have created opportunities to improve
clinical processes using machine learning methods. Prediction of the same
patient events at different time horizons can have very different applications
and interpretations; however, limited number of events in each potential time
window hurts the effectiveness of conventional machine learning algorithms. We
propose a novel time associated meta learning (TAML) method to make effective
predictions at multiple future time points. We view time-associated disease
prediction as classification tasks at multiple time points. Such
closely-related classification tasks are an excellent candidate for model-based
meta learning. To address the sparsity problem after task splitting, TAML
employs a temporal information sharing strategy to augment the number of
positive samples and include the prediction of related phenotypes or events in
the meta-training phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAML on multiple
clinical datasets, where it consistently outperforms a range of strong
baselines. We also develop a MetaEHR package for implementing both
time-associated and time-independent few-shot prediction on EHR data.

					<dc:description>  An anomalously high valence state sometimes shows up in transition-metal

rise to interesting physical properties such as superconductivity in cuprates
and rich magnetic phases in ferrates. However, no one has ever observed the
distribution of ligand holes in real space. Here, we report a successful
observation of the spatial distribution of valence electrons in cubic
perovskite SrFeO$_3$ by high-energy X-ray diffraction experiments and precise

					<dc:description>  We show that contrary to appearances, Multimodal Type Theory (MTT) over a
2-category M can be interpreted in any M-shaped diagram of categories having,
and functors preserving, M-sized limits, without the need for extra left
adjoints. This is achieved by a construction called &quot;co-dextrification&quot; that
co-freely adds left adjoints to any such diagram, which can then be used to
interpret the &quot;context lock&quot; functors of MTT. Furthermore, if any of the
functors in the diagram have right adjoints, these can also be internalized in
type theory as negative modalities in the style of FitchTT. We introduce the
name Multimodal Adjoint Type Theory (MATT) for the resulting combined general
modal type theory. In particular, we can interpret MATT in any finite diagram
of toposes and geometric morphisms, with positive modalities for inverse image
functors and negative modalities for direct image functors.

					<dc:description>  This paper studies learning-based decentralized power control methods for
cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems where a central
processor (CP) controls access points (APs) through fronthaul coordination. To
determine the transmission policy of distributed APs, it is essential to
develop a network-wide collaborative optimization mechanism. To address this
challenge, we design a cooperative learning (CL) framework which manages
computation and coordination strategies of the CP and APs using dedicated deep
neural network (DNN) modules. To build a versatile learning structure, the
proposed CL is carefully designed such that its forward pass calculations are
independent of the number of APs. To this end, we adopt a parameter reuse
concept which installs an identical DNN module at all APs. Consequently, the
proposed CL trained at a particular configuration can be readily applied to
arbitrary AP populations. Numerical results validate the advantages of the
proposed CL over conventional non-cooperative approaches.

					<dc:description>  Deformable linear objects, such as rods, cables, and ropes, play important
roles in daily life. However, manipulation of DLOs is challenging as large
geometrically nonlinear deformations may occur during the manipulation process.
This problem is made even more difficult as the different deformation modes
(e.g., stretching, bending, and twisting) may result in elastic instabilities
during manipulation. In this paper, we formulate a physics-guided data-driven
method to solve a challenging manipulation task -- accurately deploying a DLO
(an elastic rod) onto a rigid substrate along various prescribed patterns. Our
framework combines machine learning, scaling analysis, and physics-based
simulations to develop a physically informed neural controller for deployment.
We explore the complex interplay between the gravitational and elastic energies
of the manipulated DLO and obtain a control method for DLO deployment that is
robust against friction and material properties. Out of the numerous
geometrical and material properties of the rod and substrate, we show that only
three non-dimensional parameters are needed to describe the deployment process
with physical analysis. Therefore, the essence of the controlling law for the
manipulation task can be constructed with a low-dimensional model, drastically
increasing the computation speed. The effectiveness of our optimal control
scheme is shown through a comprehensive robotic case study comparing against a
heuristic control method for deploying rods for a wide variety of patterns. In
addition to this, we also showcase the practicality of our control scheme by
having a robot accomplish challenging high-level tasks such as mimicking human
handwriting and tying knots.

					<dc:title>A Mechanism for Destabilizing Cartels</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Banerjee, Soumen</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - Theoretical Economics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Attention has recently been focused on the possibility of artificially
intelligent sellers on platforms colluding to form cartels to limit output and
raise prices. Such cartels, however, feature an incentive for individual
sellers to deviate from the prescribed quantities and prices (cheating) to
increase their own profits. Stabilizing such cartels therefore requires
credible threats of punishments such as price wars. In this paper, I propose a
mechanism to destabilize cartels by protecting any cheaters from a price war by
guaranteeing a stream of profits which is unaffected by arbitrary punishments.
This method applies to the sale of differentiated goods on (multiple) platforms
or homogeneous goods through direct sales. This method for destabilizing
cartels operates purely off-equilibrium, induces no welfare losses, features
very low informational requirements (sale price and quantity data suffices) and
does not depend on the choice of discount factors.

					<dc:title>Effectiveness of Data Augmentation for Prefix Tuning with Limited Data</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Obadinma, Stephen</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Recent work has demonstrated that tuning continuous prompts on large, frozen
pretrained language models (i.e., prefix tuning or P-tuning) can yield
performance that is comparable or superior to fine-tuning. Nevertheless, the
effectiveness of such methods under the context of data augmentation, which has
been considered a common strategy to improve learning under low data regimes,
has not be studied. In this paper, we examine several popular task-agnostic
data augmentation techniques, i.e., EDA, Back Translation, and Mixup, when
using prefix tuning under data scarcity. We show that data augmentation can be
used to boost the performance of prefix tuning models, but the effectiveness of
each technique varies and certain methods can lead to a notable degradation in
performance, particularly when using larger models and on harder tasks. To help
understand the above behaviour, we run experiments which reveal how prefix
tuning generally presents a limited ability to separate the sentence embeddings
from different classes of augmented data, and displays poorer performance on
heavily altered data in particular. We also demonstrate that by adding a simple
contrastive loss we can help mitigate such issues for prefix tuning, resulting
in an improvement to augmented data performance.

					<dc:title>New Abstractions for Quantum Computing</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  The field of quantum computing is at an exciting time where we are
constructing novel hardware, evaluating algorithms, and finding out what works
best. As qubit technology grows and matures, we need to be ready to design and
program larger quantum computer systems. An important aspect of systems design
is layered abstractions to reduce complexity and guide intuition. Classical
computer systems have built up many abstractions over their history including
the layers of the hardware stack and programming abstractions like loops.
Researchers initially ported these abstractions with little modification when
designing quantum computer systems and only in recent years have some of those
abstractions been broken in the name of optimization and efficiency. We argue
that new or quantum-tailored abstractions are needed to get the most benefit
out of quantum computer systems. We keep the benefits gained through breaking
old abstraction by finding abstractions aligned with quantum physics and the
technology. This dissertation is supported by three examples of abstractions
that could become a core part of how we design and program quantum computers:
third-level logical state as scratch space, memory as a third spacial dimension
for quantum data, and hierarchical program structure.

					<dc:description>  This White Paper presents the community inputs and scientific conclusions
from the Hot and Cold QCD Town Meeting that took place September 23-25, 2022 at
MIT, as part of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) 2023 Long Range
Planning process. A total of 424 physicists registered for the meeting. The
meeting highlighted progress in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) nuclear physics
since the 2015 LRP (LRP15) and identified key questions and plausible paths to
obtaining answers to those questions, defining priorities for our research over
the coming decade. In defining the priority of outstanding physics
opportunities for the future, both prospects for the short (~ 5 years) and
longer term (5-10 years and beyond) are identified together with the
facilities, personnel and other resources needed to maximize the discovery
potential and maintain United States leadership in QCD physics worldwide. This
White Paper is organized as follows: In the Executive Summary, we detail the
Recommendations and Initiatives that were presented and discussed at the Town
Meeting, and their supporting rationales. Section 2 highlights major progress
and accomplishments of the past seven years. It is followed, in Section 3, by
an overview of the physics opportunities for the immediate future, and in
relation with the next QCD frontier: the EIC. Section 4 provides an overview of
the physics motivations and goals associated with the EIC. Section 5 is devoted
to the workforce development and support of diversity, equity and inclusion.
This is followed by a dedicated section on computing in Section 6. Section 7
describes the national need for nuclear data science and the relevance to QCD
research.

					<dc:description>  The estimation of racial disparities in health care, financial services,
voting, and other contexts is often hampered by the lack of individual-level
racial information in administrative records. In many cases, the law prohibits
the collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As
a result, many analysts have adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG), which combines individual names and addresses with the Census data to
predict race. Although BISG tends to produce well-calibrated racial
predictions, its residuals are often correlated with the outcomes of interest,
yielding biased estimates of racial disparities. We propose an alternative
identification strategy that corrects this bias. The proposed strategy is
applicable whenever one's surname is conditionally independent of the outcome
given their (unobserved) race, residence location, and other observed
characteristics. Leveraging this identification strategy, we introduce a new
class of models, Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation
(BIRDiE), that estimate racial disparities by using surnames as a
high-dimensional instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is
scalable, making it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We
also show how to address potential violations of the key identification
assumptions. A validation study based on the North Carolina voter file shows
that BIRDiE reduces error by up to 84% in comparison to the standard approaches
for estimating racial differences in party registration. Open-source software
is available which implements the proposed methodology.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We present a novel method for enabling humanoid robots to learn a wide range
of motor skills through reinforcement learning. Our approach introduces an
achievement-triggered multi-path reward function that draws on principles from
developmental robotics, enabling the robot to learn a majority of the gross
motor skills typically acquired by human babies in a single training stage. Our
experiments in a simulation environment demonstrate higher success rates and
faster learning compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches. Our
method leverages self-discovery and exploration, mimicking human infant
learning, and has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art
in humanoid robot motor skill learning.

					<dc:title>Bifurcation of the earthquake source at the end of the Omori epoch</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Guglielmi, A.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Zotov, O.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Geophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The earthquake source after the main shock can theoretically be represented
as a black box without an entrance. At the output, there is a signal in the
form of aftershocks, the frequency of which decreases on average with time
according to the Omori law. The task of the researcher is to evaluate the
structure, state and mechanism of functioning of a dynamic system simulating
the earthquake source based on the output signal. In this paper, we outline an
approach to a partial solution of this general problem. Omori's law is
presented as a differential equation of aftershock evolution. An inverse
problem has been posed and solved, the essence of which is to determine the
source deactivation coefficient from the observed frequency of aftershocks. The
existence of the so-called Omori epoch, during which the deactivation
coefficient remains constant, has been discovered. At the end of the Omori
epoch, the deactivation coefficient experiences complex variations. A
hypothesis has been put forward that the end of the Omori epoch indicates a
bifurcation, i.e. about the transition of the source from one state to a
qualitatively different state. Our paper is written for the 100th anniversary
of the death of Fusakichi Omori. Keywords: aftershocks, Omori law, evolution
equation, deactivation coefficient, inverse problem, Omori epoch, bifurcation
point.

					<dc:title>Multi-vehicle Platoon Overtaking Using NoisyNet Multi-Agent Deep
  Q-Learning Network</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>He, Lv</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  With the recent advancements in Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication technology,
autonomous vehicles are able to connect and collaborate in platoon, minimizing
accident risks, costs, and energy consumption. The significant benefits of
vehicle platooning have gained increasing attention from the automation and
artificial intelligence areas. However, few studies have focused on platoon
with overtaking. To address this problem, the NoisyNet multi-agent deep
Q-learning algorithm is developed in this paper, which the NoisyNet is employed
to improve the exploration of the environment. By considering the factors of
overtake, speed, collision, time headway and following vehicles, a
domain-tailored reward function is proposed to accomplish safe platoon
overtaking with high speed. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed
method achieves successfully overtake in various traffic density situations.

					<dc:title>Super-Resolution Neural Operator</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Wei, Min</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose Super-resolution Neural Operator (SRNO), a deep operator learning
framework that can resolve high-resolution (HR) images at arbitrary scales from
the low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Treating the LR-HR image pairs as
continuous functions approximated with different grid sizes, SRNO learns the
mapping between the corresponding function spaces. From the perspective of
approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional
latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and
then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel
integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to
generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key
characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the
kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type
attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and
therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention
architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for
SR problems to &quot;hallucinate&quot; high-frequency information from the LR image.
Experiments show that SRNO outperforms existing continuous SR methods in terms
of both accuracy and running time. Our code is at

					<dc:title>On a natural map between twistor spaces</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Davidov, Johann</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Differential Geometry</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>53C28, 32L25, 58E20</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  A diffeomorphism between the twistor spaces of two Riemannian metrics on a
smooth manifold is defined by means of a well-known ''folklore'' construction.
It is shown that this diffeomorphism is a holomorphic map with respect to the
Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer, respectively Eells-Salamon, almost complex structure if
and only if the two metrics are conformal, respectively homothetic. In these
cases, the diffeomorphism is the identity map and the result obtained provides
an interpretation of the well-known fact that the Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer almost
complex structure of a twistor space is invariant under conformal changes of
the metric on the base manifold, while that of Eells-Salamon is not invariant
in general. Another problem discussed in the paper is when the diffeomorphism
mentioned above is a harmonic map with respect to natural families of
Riemannian metrics on the twistor spaces defined by means of the two Riemannian
metrics. It is proved that if the metrics are conformal this happens if and
only if they are homothetic.

					<dc:description>  Model-based methods are widely used for reconstruction in compressed sensing
(CS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using priors to describe the images of
interest. The reconstruction process is equivalent to solving a composite
optimization problem. Accelerated proximal methods (APMs) are very popular
approaches for such problems. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton
proximal method (CQNPM) for the wavelet and total variation based CS MRI
reconstruction. Compared with APMs, CQNPM requires fewer iterations to converge
but needs to compute a more challenging proximal mapping called weighted
proximal mapping (WPM). To make CQNPM more practical, we propose efficient
methods to solve the related WPM. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of CQNPM.

					<dc:description>  We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of magnetic excitations
in YbMnSb2, a low-carrier-density Dirac semimetal in which the
antiferromagnetic Mn layers are interleaved with Sb layers that host Dirac
fermions. We observe a considerable broadening of spin waves, which is
consistent with substantial spin fermion coupling. The spin wave damping,
$\gamma$, in YbMnSb2 is roughly twice larger compared to that in a sister
material, YbMnBi2, where an indication of a small damping consistent with
theoretical analysis of the spin-fermion coupling was reported. The inter-plane
interaction between the Mn layers in YbMnSb2 is also much stronger, suggesting
that the interaction mechanism is rooted in the same spin-fermion coupling. Our
results establish the systematics of spin-fermion interactions in layered
magnetic Dirac materials.

					<dc:description>  This paper describes SatIn, a hardware accelerator for determining boolean
satisfiability (SAT) -- an important problem in many domains including
verification, security analysis, and planning.
  SatIn is based on a distributed associative array which performs short,
atomic operations that can be composed into high level operations.
  To overcome scaling limitations imposed by wire delay, we extended the
algorithms used in software solvers to function efficiently on a distributed
set of nodes communicating with message passing.
  A cycle-level simulation on real benchmarks shows that SatIn achieves an
average 72x speedup against Glucose, the winner of 2016 SAT competition, with
the potential to achieve a 113x speedup using two contexts.
  To quantify SatIn's physical requirements, we placed and routed a single
clause using the Synopsys 32nm} educational development kit.
  We were able to meet a 1ns cycle constraint with our target clause fitting in
4867um^2 and consuming 63.8uW of dynamic power; with a network, this
corresponds to 100k clauses consuming 8.3W of dynamic power (not including
leakage or global clock power) in a 500mm^2 32nm chip.

					<dc:description>  Here we report a combined study of low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) on PdCrO$_2$, a
delafossite metal with an antiferromagnetic order below ~37.5 K. First, on the
CrO$_2$-terminated polar surface we detect a gap-like feature both below and
above the N\'eel temperature. The DMFT calculations indicate that this gap is
opened due to the strong correlations of Cr-3d electrons, suggesting the hidden
Mott nature of the gap. Then, we observe two kinds of Pd-terminated polar
surfaces. One is a well-ordered Pd surface with the
Fermi-surface-nesting-induced incommensurate charge modulation, while the other
one is a reconstructed Pd surface with the individual nano-scale non-periodic
domain structures. On the well-ordered Pd surface, the interference between the
incommensurate charge modulation and the atomic lattice forms the periodic
moir\'e pattern. Our results provide important microscopic information for
fully understanding the correlated electronic properties of this class of
materials.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we consider the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations and their
numerical solution with a domain decomposition method. As an innovative
feature, we propose a feedforward neural network-enhanced approximation of the
interface conditions between the subdomains. The advantage is that the
interface condition can be updated without recomputing the Maxwell system at
each step. The main part consists of a detailed description of the construction
of the neural network for domain decomposition and the training process. To
substantiate this proof of concept, we investigate a few subdomains in some
numerical experiments with low frequencies. Therein the new approach is
compared to a classical domain decomposition method. Moreover, we highlight
current challenges of training and testing with different wave numbers and we
provide information on the behaviour of the neural-network, such as convergence
of the loss function, and different activation functions.

					<dc:description>  The observation of CP violation in meson decays is a testament to the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing paradigm, and an integral part of
the Standard Model (SM). The SM also predicts the existence of CP violation in
baryon decays that is yet to be observed. A critical test of the SM requires
that CP violation be measured in baryon decays as well, in order to verify that
it agrees with the measurement using meson decays. In this paper, we propose a
modification to the recently proposed method to measure CP violating phase
$\gamma$ in $b$-baryons, using interference arising implicitly due to Bose
symmetry considerations of the decay amplitudes.

					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we have extended the idea of gravitational Bose-Einstein
condensate star (gravastar) to charged gravastar system and explored the role
of charge in gravastar formation and its properties. We have used the most
general line element in cylindrically symmetric space-time. In this approach
the existence of singularity at the center of gravastar is removed and the
event horizon is replaced by the thin shell approximation. The proper length of
the shell is calculated along with the energy of the thin shell. A mass limit
for thin shell has also been evaluated. The entropy calculation shows that the
entropy of the configuration is smaller than that of a quasi-black hole system
and even smaller than that of a classical black hole. Unlike black hole, the
gravastar system is a stable configuration and there is no information paradox.

					<dc:description>  Breaking of discrete parity at high scale gives rise to $Z_2$-domain walls.
The metastability of such walls can make them relatively long lived and
contradict standard cosmology. We consider two classes of theories with similar
underlying feature, the left right symmetric theories and two Higgs doublet
models. These theories effectively possess two steps of breaking of $Z_2$
discrete symmetries. The domains formed at a high energy scale in the first
step further decompose into subdomains near the electroweak scale in the second
step. Then a QCD instanton induced energy difference can remove the subdomain
walls as well as the domain walls successfully. This result holds regardless of
whether the domain wall removal is guided by small symmetry breaking terms or
purely statistical outcome of a homogeneous vacuum. We then investigate the
gravitational waves arising from the collapse of such domain walls and show
that the peak frequency of these waves lies in the $10^{-9}$ - $10^{-7}$ Hz
band, depending on annihilation temperatures of $10^{-2}$ - 1 GeV, which is
sensitive to pulsar timing based experiments such as SKA and NANOGrav.

					<dc:description>  During industrial processing, unforeseen defects may arise in products due to
uncontrollable factors. Although unsupervised methods have been successful in
defect localization, the usual use of pre-trained models results in
low-resolution outputs, which damages visual performance. To address this
issue, we propose PyramidFlow, the first fully normalizing flow method without
pre-trained models that enables high-resolution defect localization.
Specifically, we propose a latent template-based defect contrastive
localization paradigm to reduce intra-class variance, as the pre-trained models
do. In addition, PyramidFlow utilizes pyramid-like normalizing flows for
multi-scale fusing and volume normalization to help generalization. Our
comprehensive studies on MVTecAD demonstrate the proposed method outperforms
the comparable algorithms that do not use external priors, even achieving
state-of-the-art performance in more challenging BTAD scenarios.

					<dc:description>  We use an extended Roy equation including a bound state pole to study
$\pi\pi$ scatterings at unphysical large pion masses when $\sigma$ becomes a
bound state. The coupled integral equations at large pion masses are solved by
taking the lattice driving terms and the Regge amplitudes as inputs. Relying on
the solutions of Roy equations that respect unitarity, analyticity and crossing
symmetry, we give predictions to the phase shifts with $IJ=00,11,20$ in the
elastic energy region. We then perform analytical continuation into complex
plane to search various poles, all of which are inside the validity domain of
Roy equation.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Experiment</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The ee$\in$MC generator package is extended to include $e^{+}e^{-} \to
Hadrons (n\gamma)$ events where the photons can be generated in either the
initial-state or final-state production. In particular, the $e^{+}e^{-} \to
\pi^{+}\pi^{-} (n\gamma)$, $e^{+}e^{-} \to \Upsilon(4s) (m\gamma) \to
B^{+}B^{-} (n\gamma)$ and $e^{+}e^{-} \to \Upsilon(4s) (m\gamma) \to
B^{0}\bar{B}^{-} (n\gamma)$ decay channels have been implemented in the
generator. The B-mesons are not decayed in ee$\in$MC, but are left for other
generators that specialized in B-mesons. Both the initial-state-radiation and
final-state-radiation are simulated using the Yennie-Frautschi-Suura
Exponentiation procedure \cite{Yennie:1961}, where several effective models are
implemented to investigate the assumption of the radiative structure of the
final-state vertex. The impact of these radiative models on the $e^{+}e^{-} \to
\Upsilon(4s) (m\gamma) \to B^{+}B^{-} (n\gamma)$ and $e^{+}e^{-} \to
\Upsilon(4s) (m\gamma) \to B^{0}\bar{B}^{-} (n\gamma)$ processes, excludes some
models, particularly, in regards to the Coulomb potential. This has an
important impact for meson and baryon systems near threshold.

					<dc:description>  Wireless 5G is a promising and widely used technology. Existing wireless
technologies utilize a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) system based on
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). In general, the aim of PS is to improve
spectral efficiency (SE) using a new MCS based on standard QAM constellations
with unequal probability points. Although 5G wireless requirements continue to
use QAM constellations with equal probability points, probabilistic shaping
(PS) is now used in ATSC broadcasting and optics. In this paper, we apply PS
under the limitations of the 5G wireless protocol, such as the relatively small
size of the transport block, low complexity requirements and realistic LDPC
codes. The deliverables of this work include technology proposals for 5G-6G
wireless communication, a study of PS mathematical methods and numerical
experiments in the Sionna simulator at the physical communication system level.

					<dc:description>  This research paper presents a novel deep learning-based neural network
architecture, named Y-Net, for achieving music source separation. The proposed
architecture performs end-to-end hybrid source separation by extracting
features from both spectrogram and waveform domains. Inspired by the U-Net
architecture, Y-Net predicts a spectrogram mask to separate vocal sources from
a mixture signal. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture for music source separation with fewer parameters. Overall, our
work presents a promising approach for improving the accuracy and efficiency of
music source separation.

					<dc:description>  Radiation from an accelerating charge is a basic process that can serve as an
intersection between classical and quantum physics. We present two exactly
soluble electron trajectories that permit analysis of the radiation emitted,
exploring its time evolution and spectrum by analogy with the moving mirror
model of the dynamic Casimir effect. These classical solutions are finite
energy, rectilinear (nonperiodic), asymptotically zero velocity worldlines with
corresponding quantum analog beta Bogolyubov coefficients. One of them has an
interesting connection to uniform acceleration and Leonardo da Vinci's water

					<dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a popular task that combines vision
and language, with numerous relevant implementations in literature. Even though
there are some attempts that approach explainability and robustness issues in
VQA models, very few of them employ counterfactuals as a means of probing such
challenges in a model-agnostic way. In this work, we propose a systematic
method for explaining the behavior and investigating the robustness of VQA
models through counterfactual perturbations. For this reason, we exploit
structured knowledge bases to perform deterministic, optimal and controllable
word-level replacements targeting the linguistic modality, and we then evaluate
the model's response against such counterfactual inputs. Finally, we
qualitatively extract local and global explanations based on counterfactual
responses, which are ultimately proven insightful towards interpreting VQA
model behaviors. By performing a variety of perturbation types, targeting
different parts of speech of the input question, we gain insights to the
reasoning of the model, through the comparison of its responses in different
adversarial circumstances. Overall, we reveal possible biases in the
decision-making process of the model, as well as expected and unexpected
patterns, which impact its performance quantitatively and qualitatively, as
indicated by our analysis.

					<dc:description>  Point-based cell recognition, which aims to localize and classify cells
present in a pathology image, is a fundamental task in digital pathology image
analysis. The recently developed point-to-point network (P2PNet) has achieved
unprecedented cell recognition accuracy and efficiency compared to methods that
rely on intermediate density map representations. However, P2PNet could not
leverage multi-scale information since it can only decode a single feature map.
Moreover, the distribution of predefined point proposals, which is determined
by data properties, restricts the resolution of the feature map to decode,
i.e., the encoder design. To lift these limitations, we propose a variant of
P2PNet named deformable proposal-aware P2PNet (DPA-P2PNet) in this study. The
proposed method uses coordinates of point proposals to directly extract
multi-scale region-of-interest (ROI) features for feature enhancement. Such a
design also opens up possibilities to exploit dynamic distributions of
proposals. We further devise a deformation module to improve the proposal
quality. Extensive experiments on four datasets with various staining styles
demonstrate that DPA-P2PNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
point-based cell recognition, which reveals the high potentiality in assisting
pathologist assessments.

					<dc:description>  We answer a question of John Baez, on the relationship between the classical
Euler characteristic and the Baez-Dolan homotopy cardinality, by constructing a
unique additive common generalization after restriction to an odd prime p. This
is achieved by ell-adically extrapolating to height n = -1 the sequence of
Euler characteristics associated with the Morava K(n) cohomology theories for
(any) ell | p-1. We compute this sequence explicitly in several cases and
incorporate in the theory some folklore heuristic comparisons between the Euler
characteristic and the homotopy cardinality involving summation of divergent
series.

					<dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel bin picking framework, two-stage grasping, aiming
at precise grasping of cluttered small objects. Object density estimation and
rough grasping are conducted in the first stage. Fine segmentation, detection,
grasping, and pushing are performed in the second stage. A small object bin
picking system has been realized to exhibit the concept of two-stage grasping.
Experiments have shown the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Unlike
traditional bin picking methods focusing on vision-based grasping planning
using classic frameworks, the challenges of picking cluttered small objects can
be solved by the proposed new framework with simple vision detection and
planning.

					<dc:description>  In wireless communication systems, there are many stages for signal
transmission. Among them, mapping and demapping convert a sequence of bits into
a sequence of complex numbers and vice versa. This operation is performed by a
system of constellations~ -- by a set of labeled points on the complex plane.
Usually, the geometry of the constellation is fixed, and constellation points
are uniformly spaced, e.g., the same quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is
used in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By eliminating the
uniformity of constellations, it is possible to achieve greater values of
capacity. Due to the current standard restrictions, it is difficult to change
the constellation both on the mapper or demapper side. In this case, one can
optimize the constellation only on the mapper or the demapper side using
original methodology. By the numerical calculating of capacity, we show that
the optimal geometric constellation depends on SNR. Optimization is carried out
by maximizing mutual information (MI). The MI function describes the amount of
information being transmitted through the channel with the optimal encoding. To
prove the effectiveness of this approach we provide numerical experiments in
the modern physical level Sionna simulator using the realistic LDPC codes and
the MIMO 5G OFDM channels.

					<dc:description>  Operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments that
feature dynamic obstacles and external disturbances poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the inherent uncertainty in such scenarios.
Additionally, inaccurate robot localization and modeling errors further
exacerbate these challenges. Recent research on UAV motion planning in static
environments has been unable to cope with the rapidly changing surroundings,
resulting in trajectories that may not be feasible. Moreover, previous
approaches that have addressed dynamic obstacles or external disturbances in
isolation are insufficient to handle the complexities of such environments.
This paper proposes a reliable motion planning framework for UAVs, integrating
various uncertainties into a chance constraint that characterizes the
uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. The chance constraint provides a
probabilistic safety certificate by calculating the collision probability
between the robot's Gaussian-distributed forward reachable set and states of
obstacles. To reduce the conservatism of the planned trajectory, we propose a
tight upper bound of the collision probability and evaluate it both exactly and
approximately. The approximated solution is used to generate motion primitives
as a reference trajectory, while the exact solution is leveraged to iteratively
optimize the trajectory for better results. Our method is thoroughly tested in
simulation and real-world experiments, verifying its reliability and
effectiveness in uncertain environments.

					<dc:description>  This paper proposes an algorithm for obtaining an event-based video from a
noisy input video given by physics-based Monte Carlo path tracing of synthetic
3D scenes. Since the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) detects temporal brightness
changes as events, the problem of efficiently rendering event-based video boils
down to detecting the changes from noisy brightness values. To this end, we
extend a denoising method based on a weighted local regression (WLR) to detect
the brightness changes rather than applying denoising to each video frame.
Specifically, we regress a WLR model only on frames where an event is detected,
which significantly reduces the computational cost of the regression. We show
that our efficient method is robust to noisy video frames obtained from a few
path-traced samples and performs comparably to or even better than an approach
that denoises every frame.

					<dc:description>  As security communities brace for the emerging social automation based
threats, we examine the mechanisms of developing situation awareness in
cyberspace and the governance issues that socialbots bring into this existing
paradigm of cyber situation awareness. We point out that an organisation's
situation awareness in cyberspace is a phenomena fundamentally distinct from
the original conception of situation awareness, requiring continuous data
exchange and knowledge management where the standard implementation mechanisms
require significant policy attention in light of threats like malicious social
automation. We conceptualise Cyberspace Awareness as a socio-technical
phenomena with Syntactic, Semantic, and Operatic dimensions - each subject to a
number of stressors which are exacerbated under social automation based
threats. The paper contributes to the ideas of situational awareness in
cyberspace, and characterises the challenges therein around tackling the
increasingly social and often pervasive, automation in cyber threat
environments.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this study, we propose the use of attention hypernetworks in camera pose
localization. The dynamic nature of natural scenes, including changes in
environment, perspective, and lighting, creates an inherent domain gap between
the training and test sets that limits the accuracy of contemporary
localization networks. To overcome this issue, we suggest a camera pose
regressor that integrates a hypernetwork. During inference, the hypernetwork
generates adaptive weights for the localization regression heads based on the
input image, effectively reducing the domain gap. We also suggest the use of a
Transformer-Encoder as the hypernetwork, instead of the common multilayer
perceptron, to derive an attention hypernetwork. The proposed approach achieves
superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on contemporary datasets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of using hypernetworks
in camera pose regression, as well as using Transformer-Encoders as
hypernetworks. We make our code publicly available.

					<dc:description>  In this paper we study triharmonic hypersurfaces immersed in a space form
$N^{n+1}(c)$. We prove that any proper CMC triharmonic hypersurface in the
sphere $\mathbb S^{n+1}$ has constant scalar curvature; any CMC triharmonic
hypersurface in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb H^{n+1}$ is minimal. Moreover, we
show that any CMC triharmonic hypersurface in the Euclidean space $\mathbb
R^{n+1}$ is minimal provided that the multiplicity of the principal curvature
zero is at most one. In particular, we are able to prove that every CMC
triharmonic hypersurface in the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{6}$ is
minimal.These results extend some recent works due to Montaldo-Oniciuc-Ratto
and Chen-Guan, and give affirmative answer to the generalized Chen's
conjecture.

					<dc:description>  This paper extends the existing drawdown modulation control policy to include
a novel restart mechanism for trading. It is known that the drawdown modulation
policy guarantees the maximum percentage drawdown no larger than a prespecified
drawdown limit for all time with probability one. However, when the
prespecified limit is approaching in practice, such a modulation policy becomes
a stop-loss order, which may miss the profitable follow-up opportunities if
any. Motivated by this, we add a data-driven restart mechanism into the
drawdown modulation trading system to auto-tune the performance. We find that
with the restart mechanism, our policy may achieve a superior trading
performance to that without the restart, even with a nonzero transaction costs
setting. To support our findings, some empirical studies using equity ETF and
cryptocurrency with historical price data are provided.

logic. Prime products are shown to satisfy a version of {\L}o\'s's Theorem
restricted to positive formulas, as well as the following variant of Keisler
Isomorphism Theorem: under the generalized continuum hypothesis, two models
have the same positive theory if and only if they have isomorphic prime powers
of ultrapowers.

					<dc:title>Estimating Extreme 3D Image Rotation with Transformer Cross-Attention</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Dekel, Shay</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Keller, Yosi</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The estimation of large and extreme image rotation plays a key role in
multiple computer vision domains, where the rotated images are related by a
limited or a non-overlapping field of view. Contemporary approaches apply
convolutional neural networks to compute a 4D correlation volume to estimate
the relative rotation between image pairs. In this work, we propose a
cross-attention-based approach that utilizes CNN feature maps and a
Transformer-Encoder, to compute the cross-attention between the activation maps
of the image pairs, which is shown to be an improved equivalent of the 4D
correlation volume, used in previous works. In the suggested approach, higher
attention scores are associated with image regions that encode visual cues of
rotation. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and optimizes a simple
regression loss. It is experimentally shown to outperform contemporary
state-of-the-art schemes when applied to commonly used image rotation datasets
and benchmarks, and establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy on these
datasets. We make our code publicly available.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We consider the general free field theory such that system of equations of
motion includes the subsystem with special property. If the subsystem is
considered by itself, it would be the topological field theory having no local
degrees of freedom. Various well-known field theories admit such a subsystem,
including Einstein's gravity. As the subsystem is a topological theory, the
general solution is a pure gauge, modulo global degrees of freedom. Gauge
symmetry of the subsystem of linear theory can be explicitly found, providing
the general solution to the subsystem. Substituting this solution into entire
system, we arrive at the equivalent field theory where the role of the field
variables is played by the gauge parameters of the topological subsystem. These
fields can be viewed as the potentials for the original ones. A general
procedure is proposed for constructing the &quot;parent action&quot; which includes the
fields of both dual formulations. At the level of this action, one can switch
between the dual formulation by imposing appropriate gauge fixing conditions.
This general dualisation procedure is exemplified by massless and massive spin
two fields. For the massless case, the hook type tensor serves as the potential
for the metric, while for the massive case it is the fourth rank tensor with
window Young diagram.

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the three-dimensional (3D) simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM) problem in complex outdoor and indoor environments based
only on millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communication signals. Firstly, we
propose a deep-learning based mapping (DLM) algorithm that can leverage the
reflections point on the first-order none line-of-sight (NLOS) communications
links (CLs) to build the 3D point cloud map of the environment. Specifically,
we design a classification neural network to identify the first-order NLOS CL
and theoretically calculate the geometric coordinates of the reflection points
on it. Secondly, we take the advantage of both the inertial measurement unit
and the beam-squint assisted localization method to realize real-time and
precise localizations. Then, combining the DLM and the adopted localization
algorithm, we develop the communication-based SLAM (C-SLAM) framework that can
carry out SLAM without any prior knowledge of the environment. Moreover,
extensive simulations of both complex outdoor and indoor environments validate
the effectiveness of our approach.

					<dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
scientific and applied problems. However, some complex tasks still are
difficult to handle using a single model and algorithm. The highly popular
ensemble reinforcement learning (ERL) has become an important method to handle
complex tasks with the advantage of combining reinforcement learning and
ensemble learning (EL). ERL combines several models or training algorithms to
fully explore the problem space and has strong generalization characteristics.
This study presents a comprehensive survey on ERL to provide the readers with
an overview of the recent advances and challenges. The background is introduced
first. The strategies successfully applied in ERL are analyzed in detail.
Finally, we outline some open questions and conclude by discussing some future
research directions of ERL. This survey contributes to ERL development by
providing a guide for future scientific research and engineering applications.

					<dc:title>Non-perturbative theory of the electron-phonon coupling and its

					<dc:creator>Bianco, Raffaello</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Materials Science</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The harmonic approximation of ionic fluctuations and the linear coupling
between phonons and electrons provide the basic approach to compute, from first
principles, the contribution that the nuclei dynamics and its interaction with
electrons have on materials' properties. These approaches are questionable, at
least, whenever quantum and anharmonic effects on the nuclei vibrational
properties are large, such as in hydrogenous systems, high-$T_c$
superconductors, and when systems are close to displacive phase transitions.
Here we propose a novel non-perturbative approach to compute the
electron-phonon interaction from first principles that includes non-linear
effects and takes into account the quantum nature of nuclei. The method is
based on the $GW^{(en)}$ approximation for the electron self-energy, given by
the effective nuclei-mediated electron-electron interaction $W^{(en)}$ and the
electron Green's function $G$. The electrons are treated at a mean-field level
and the nuclei dynamics is described with a Gaussian distribution function,
which can effectively take into account anharmonic effects at a mean-field
level, e.g. within the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Pivotal
quantities of the Gaussian $GW^{(en)}$ self-energy are the renormalized average
vertices, which are computed in supercells with a stochastic approach, using
the the self-consistent electronic potential computed for different atomic
configurations. In order to validate the method, $GW^{(en)}$ calculations are
performed on aluminum, a highly harmonic system with weak electron-phonon
coupling. The obtained results coincide with the ones obtained with standard
linear electron-phonon calculations. However, calculations performed on
palladium hydride, a very anharmonic system, show a highly non-linear
electron-phonon interaction, with $GW^{(en)}$ bringing corrections as high as
the linear-order result.

					<dc:description>  The network security analyzers use intrusion detection systems (IDSes) to
distinguish malicious traffic from benign ones. The deep learning-based IDSes
are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the
time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new
generation of IDSes still suffers from a number of challenges. One of the main
issues of an IDS is facing traffic concept drift which manifests itself as new
(i.e., zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign
users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed
to a distributed architecture to handle big data challenges.
  We propose a framework for adapting DL-based models to the changing
attack/benign traffic behaviors, considering a more practical scenario (i.e.,
online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly
detectors in addition to the federated learning approach to solve the
above-mentioned challenges. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements
sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability
score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its
estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep
models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and
CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we
show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic
concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models
are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e.,
achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new
flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate
for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e., detecting
intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets).

target 3-manifolds where the target is equipped with an isometric G-action. We
show that the energy is bounded below by an equivariant version of the degree
of a map, describe the associated BPS equations, and discuss and classify
solutions in the cases where G=U(1) and G=SU(2).

					<dc:title>Recursion in the classical limit and the neutron-star Compton amplitude</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Haddad, Kays</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study the compatibility of recursive techniques with the classical limit
of scattering amplitudes through the construction of the classical Compton
amplitude for general spinning compact objects. This is done using BCFW
recursion on three-point amplitudes expressed in terms of the classical spin
vector and tensor, and expanded to next-to-leading-order in $\hbar$ by using
the heavy on-shell spinors. Matching to the result of classical computations,
we find that lower-point quantum contributions are, in general, required for
the recursive construction of classical, spinning, higher-point amplitudes with
massive propagators. We are thus led to conclude that BCFW recursion and the
classical limit do not commute. In possession of the classical Compton
amplitude, we remove non-localities to all orders in spin for opposite graviton
helicities, and to fifth order in the same-helicity case. Finally, all possible
on-shell contact terms potentially relevant to black-hole scattering at the
second post-Minkowskian order are enumerated and written explicitly.

stars is a natural phenomenon that releases up to $40\%$ of the matter's
rest-mass energy, which is considered a source of radiation. In active galactic
nuclei and X-ray binaries, huge luminosities are observed as a result of
accretion. Using isothermal fluid, we examine the accretion and geodesic motion
of particles in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime in
the Einstein-$SU(N)$ non-linear sigma model. In the accretion process, the
disk-like structure is produced by the geodesic motion of particles near the
black hole. We determine the innermost stable circular orbit, energy flux,
radiation temperature, and radioactive efficiency numerically. In the
equatorial plane, we investigate the mobility of particles with stabilities
that form circular orbits. We examine perturbations of a test particle by using
restoring forces and particle oscillations in the vicinity of the black hole.
We analyze the maximum accretion rate and critical flow of the fluid. Our
findings demonstrate how parameter $N$ influences the circular motion of a test
particle as well as the maximum accretion rate of the black hole in the
Einstein-$SU(N)$ non-linear sigma model.

					<dc:description>  Generalized additive models (GAMs) provide a way to blend parametric and
non-parametric (function approximation) techniques together, making them
flexible tools suitable for many modeling problems. For instance, GAMs can be
used to introduce flexibility to standard linear regression models, to express
&quot;almost linear&quot; behavior for a phenomenon. A need for GAMs often arises also in
physical models, where the model given by theory is an approximation of
reality, and one wishes to express the coefficients as functions instead of
constants. In this paper, we discuss GAMs from the Bayesian perspective,
focusing on linear additive models, where the final model can be formulated as
a linear-Gaussian system. We discuss Gaussian Processes (GPs) and local basis
function approaches for describing the unknown functions in GAMs, and
techniques for specifying prior distributions for them, including spatially
varying smoothness. GAMs with both univariate and multivariate functions are
discussed. Hyperparameter estimation techniques are presented in order to
alleviate the tuning problems related to GAM models. Implementations of all the
examples discussed in the paper are made available.

					<dc:description>  Muography is an imaging technique based on attenuation of the directional
muon flux traversing geological or anthropic structures. Several simulation
frameworks help to perform muography studies by combining specialised codes
from the muon generation (CORSIKA and CRY) and the muon transport (GEANT4,
PUMAS, and MUSIC) to the detector performance (GEANT4). This methodology is
very precise but consumes significant computational resources and time.
  In this work, we present the end-to-end python-based MUographY Simulation
Code. MUYSC implements a muography simulation framework capable of rapidly
estimating rough muograms of any geological structure worldwide. MUYSC
generates the muon flux at the observation place, transports the muons along
the geological target, and determines the integrated muon flux detected by the
telescope. Additionally, MUYSC computes the muon detector parameters
(acceptance, solid angle, and angular resolution) and reconstructs the
3-dimensional density distribution of the target. We evaluated its performance
by comparing it with previous results of several simulation frameworks.

converging in distribution towards a standard Gaussian. In this article,
without any additional assumptions, we derive the asymptotic smoothness of the
densities of $F_n$, as well as the convergence of all its derivatives in every
$L^{q}(\mathbb{R})$ for all $q\in[1,+\infty]$ towards the corresponding

improve the currently known types of convergence which are total variation and

Using the helicity formalism of Jacob and Wick, we derive the spin-3/2 density

\Omega^- \bar\Omega^+$ process in the BESIII experiment, we attempt to explain
the polarization of $\Omega^-$ using a combination of probabilities of the

obvious tensor polarization along the $z$-axis, a tensor polarization along the
$x$-axis, and an obvious tensor polarization along the y-axis, but a weak
vector polarization along the $y$-axis for the first time.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) provides a signal-free intersection
scheduling paradigm for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Distributed
learning method has emerged as an attractive branch of AIM research. Compared
with centralized AIM, distributed AIM can be deployed to CAVs at a lower cost,
and compared with rule-based and optimization-based method, learning-based
method can treat various complicated real-time intersection scenarios more
flexibly. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the mainstream approach in
distributed learning to address AIM problems. However, the large-scale
simultaneous interactive decision of multiple agents and the rapid changes of
environment caused by interactions pose challenges for DRL, making its reward
curve oscillating and hard to converge, and ultimately leading to a compromise
in safety and computing efficiency. For this, we propose a non-RL learning
framework, called Distributed Hierarchical Adversarial Learning (D-HAL). The
framework includes an actor network that generates the actions of each CAV at
each step. The immediate discriminator evaluates the interaction performance of
the actor network at the current step, while the final discriminator makes the
final evaluation of the overall trajectory from a series of interactions. In
this framework, the long-term outcome of the behavior no longer motivates the
actor network in terms of discounted rewards, but rather through a designed
adversarial loss function with discriminative labels. The proposed model is
evaluated at a four-way-six-lane intersection, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods on ensuring safety and reducing travel time.

self-gravitating gases. We examine gravitational amplification in the
isothermal sheet, cylinder, and sphere, assuming that the systems are highly
collisional and reach a new state of thermal equilibrium after perturbation.
Under the assumptions, the isothermal sheet and cylinder amplify gravitational
fields due to test sheet and line masses by 68 $\%$ and 53 $\%$ maximally. On
the one hand, in the isothermal sphere, gravitational fields due to test point
mass are amplified oscillatorily with radius and show a repulsive effect at
large radii.

					<dc:description>  The number of objects is considered an important factor in a variety of tasks
in the agricultural domain. Automated counting can improve farmers decisions
regarding yield estimation, stress detection, disease prevention, and more. In
recent years, deep learning has been increasingly applied to many
agriculture-related applications, complementing conventional computer-vision
algorithms for counting agricultural objects. This article reviews progress in
the past decade and the state of the art for counting methods in agriculture,
focusing on deep-learning methods. It presents an overview of counting
algorithms, metrics, platforms, and sensors, a list of all publicly available
datasets, and an in-depth discussion of various deep-learning methods used for
counting. Finally, it discusses open challenges in object counting using deep
learning and gives a glimpse into new directions and future perspectives for
counting research. The review reveals a major leap forward in object counting
in agriculture in the past decade, led by the penetration of deep learning
methods into counting platforms.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new method to compute nonlinear transport coefficients in
holography, such as nonlinear DC conductivity and nonlinear friction
coefficient. The conventional methods can be applied only to the models whose
action in the gravity dual has the ``square-root structure,'' i.e., the
Dirac-Born-Infeld action of the probe D-branes or the Nambu-Goto action of the
probe strings. Our method is applicable to a wider range of holographic models
whose action does not have such a square-root structure. Our method is based on
the requirement of regularity, and we propose the conditions for regularity in
the form of two simultaneous equations, which we call the patchwork condition.
Our method also enables us to estimate the effective temperature of the
nonequilibrium steady states in a wider range of holographic models. We show
that a general model exhibits different effective temperatures for different
fluctuation modes.

					<dc:description>  If $R$ is a topological ring, then it is well known that $R^{\ast}$, the
group of units of $R$, with the subspace topology is not necessarily a
topological group. This fact first leads us to a natural definition: By an
\emph{absolute topological ring} we mean a topological ring such that its group
of units with the subspace topology is a topological group. We prove that every
commutative ring with the $I$-adic topology is an absolute topological ring.
Next we show that for a given topological ring $R$ then $R^{\ast}$ with the
subspace topology $\mathscr{T}$ is a topological group (or equivalently, $R$ is
an absolute topological ring) if and only if $\mathscr{T}=\mathscr{T}_{f}$
where the topology $\mathscr{T}_{f}$ is induced by the map $R^{\ast}\rightarrow
R\times R$ which is given by $a\mapsto(a,a^{-1})$. If $G$ is a topological
group then every monomial function $G^{n}\rightarrow G$ as well as if $R$ is a
topological ring then every polynomial function $R^{n}\rightarrow R$ are
continuous. In particular, it is shown that the Boolean ring of every
topological ring with the subspace topology is a topological ring. As another
main result, we prove that for the $I$-adic topology over a ring $R$, then
$\pi_{0}(R)=R/(\bigcap\limits_{n\geqslant1}I^{n})=t(R)$ where $\pi_{0}(R)$ is
the space of connected components of $R$ and $t(R)$ is the space of irreducible
closed subsets of $R$. We realized that the main result of Koh \cite{kwangil}
as well as its corrected version \cite[Chap II, \S12, Theorem 12.1]{Ursul} are
not true, then we corrected this result in the right way. Finally, we improve
one of the main results of Ganesan \cite{Ganesan} which asserts that a given
nonzero ring is a finite nonfield ring if and only if its zerodivisors is a
finite nonzero set.

					<dc:description>  The ideal form of Visual Question Answering requires understanding, grounding
and reasoning in the joint space of vision and language and serves as a proxy
for the AI task of scene understanding. However, most existing VQA benchmarks
are limited to just picking the answer from a pre-defined set of options and
lack attention to text. We present a new challenge with a dataset that contains
23,781 questions based on 10124 image-text pairs. Specifically, the task
requires the model to align multimedia representations of the same entity to
implement multi-hop reasoning between image and text and finally use natural
language to answer the question. The aim of this challenge is to develop and
benchmark models that are capable of multimedia entity alignment, multi-step
reasoning and open-ended answer generation.

					<dc:subject>18E10, 93C05</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We describe an abelian category $\mathbf{ab}(M)$ in which the solution sets
of finitely many linear equations over an arbitrary ring $R$ with values in an
arbitrary left $R$-module $M$ reside as objects. Such solution sets are also
called behaviors in algebraic systems theory. We both characterize
$\mathbf{ab}(M)$ by a universal property and give a construction of
$\mathbf{ab}(M)$ as a Serre quotient of the free abelian category generated by
$R$. We discuss features of $\mathbf{ab}(M)$ relevant in the context of
algebraic systems theory: if $R$ is left coherent and $M$ is an fp-injective
fp-cogenerator, then $\mathbf{ab}(M)$ is antiequivalent to the category of
finitely presented left $R$-modules. This provides an alternative point of view
to the important module-behavior duality in algebraic systems theory. We also
obtain a dual statement: if $R$ is right coherent and $M$ is fp-faithfully
flat, $\mathbf{ab}(M)$ is equivalent to the category of finitely presented
right $R$-modules. As an example application, we discuss delay-differential
systems with constant coefficients and a polynomial signal space. Moreover, we
propose definitions of controllability and observability in our setup.

					<dc:description>  A classic inferential problem in statistics is the two-sample hypothesis
test, where we test whether two samples of observations are either drawn from
the same distribution or two distinct distributions. However, standard methods
for performing this test require strong distributional assumptions on the two
samples of data. We propose a semi-Bayesian nonparametric (semi-BNP) procedure
for the two-sample hypothesis testing problem. First, we will derive a novel
BNP maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) measure-based hypothesis test. Next, we will
show that our proposed test will outperform frequentist MMD-based methods by
yielding a smaller false rejection and acceptance rate of the null. Finally, we
will show that we can embed our proposed hypothesis testing procedure within a
generative adversarial network (GAN) framework as an application of our method.
Using our novel BNP hypothesis test, this new GAN approach can help to mitigate
the lack of diversity in the generated samples and produce a more accurate
inferential algorithm compared to traditional techniques.

					<dc:description>  We present an algorithm for fast generation of quasi-uniform and variable
density spatial nodes on domains whose boundaries are represented as
computer-aided design (CAD) models, more specifically non-uniform rational
B-splines (NURBS). This new algorithm enables the solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs) within the volumes enclosed by these CAD models
using (collocation-based) meshless numerical discretizations. Our hierarchical
algorithm first generates quasi-uniform node sets directly on the NURBS
surfaces representing the domain boundary, then uses the NURBS representation
in conjunction with the surface nodes to generate nodes within the volume
enclosed by the NURBS surface. We provide evidence for the quality of these
node sets by analyzing them in terms of local regularity and separation
distances. Finally, we demonstrate that these node sets are well-suited (both
in terms of accuracy and numerical stability) for meshless radial basis
function generated finite differences (RBF-FD) discretizations of the Poisson,
Navier-Cauchy, and heat equations. Our algorithm constitutes an important first
in bridging the field of node generation for meshless discretizations with mesh
generation for isogeometric analysis.

					<dc:description>  THz magnetization dynamics is a key property of antiferromagnets as well as
ferrimagnets that could harness the THz forefront and spintronics. While most
of the present THz measurement techniques are for bulk materials whose
sensitivities rely on the volume of the material, measurement techniques
suitable for thin films are quite limited. In this study, we explored and
demonstrated electrical detection of the antiferromagnetic dynamics in
ferrimagnetic Gd-Co thin films by using a 154 GHz gyrotron, a high-power
electromagnetic wave source. Captured resonant modes allow us to characterize
the peculiar magnetization dynamics of the Gd-Co around the net angular
momentum compensation. As the gyrotron frequency is scalable up to THz, our
demonstration can be an important milestone toward the THz measurements for
antiferro- and ferri- magnetic thin films.

					<dc:title>Swim: A General-Purpose, High-Performing, and Efficient Activation

					<dc:description>  Activation functions play a significant role in the performance of deep
learning algorithms. In particular, the Swish activation function tends to
outperform ReLU on deeper models, including deep reinforcement learning models,
across challenging tasks. Despite this progress, ReLU is the preferred function
partly because it is more efficient than Swish. Furthermore, in contrast to the
fields of computer vision and natural language processing, the deep
reinforcement learning and robotics domains have seen less inclination to adopt
new activation functions, such as Swish, and instead continue to use more
traditional functions, like ReLU. To tackle those issues, we propose Swim, a
general-purpose, efficient, and high-performing alternative to Swish, and then
provide an analysis of its properties as well as an explanation for its
high-performance relative to Swish, in terms of both reward-achievement and
efficiency. We focus on testing Swim on MuJoCo's locomotion continuous control
tasks since they exhibit more complex dynamics and would therefore benefit most
from a high-performing and efficient activation function. We also use the TD3
algorithm in conjunction with Swim and explain this choice in the context of
the robot locomotion domain. We then conclude that Swim is a state-of-the-art
activation function for continuous control locomotion tasks and recommend using
it with TD3 as a working framework.

					<dc:description>  Unconstrained Asian roads often involve poor infrastructure, affecting
overall road safety. Missing traffic signs are a regular part of such roads.
Missing or non-existing object detection has been studied for locating missing
curbs and estimating reasonable regions for pedestrians on road scene images.
Such methods involve analyzing task-specific single object cues. In this paper,
we present the first and most challenging video dataset for missing objects,
with multiple types of traffic signs for which the cues are visible without the
signs in the scenes. We refer to it as the Missing Traffic Signs Video Dataset
(MTSVD). MTSVD is challenging compared to the previous works in two aspects i)
The traffic signs are generally not present in the vicinity of their cues, ii)
The traffic signs cues are diverse and unique. Also, MTSVD is the first
publicly available missing object dataset. To train the models for identifying
missing signs, we complement our dataset with 10K traffic sign tracks, with 40
percent of the traffic signs having cues visible in the scenes. For identifying
missing signs, we propose the Cue-driven Contextual Attention units (CueCAn),
which we incorporate in our model encoder. We first train the encoder to
classify the presence of traffic sign cues and then train the entire
segmentation model end-to-end to localize missing traffic signs. Quantitative
and qualitative analysis shows that CueCAn significantly improves the
performance of base models.

					<dc:description>  A novel light-sensitive chiral dopant ChD-3816 (an azo compound containing
4-hexanoyloxyphenyl and 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexylbenzoate moieties) was
used for inducing helical twisting in Ntb-forming mixtures of CB7CB/CB6OCB with
5CB added to decrease the phase transition temperatures. The effects of
ChD-3816 upon phase transition temperatures, as well as effects of its
concentration on the measured values of helical twisting were determined. Most
of the measured parameters could be varied due to light-induced trans-cis
isomerization of ChD-3816. Under electric field, selective reflection spectra
in the visible range were obtained for the emerging ChOH structures, with the
wavelengths controllable both by electric field and appropriate UV irradiation.
Possible applications for dynamic formation of contrast images are discussed.

					<dc:title>Multi-Target Cooperative Visible Light Positioning: A Compressed Sensing

					<dc:creator>Wang, Xianyao</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, a compressed sensing (CS) based framework of multi-target
cooperative visible light positioning (VLP) is formulated to realize
simultaneous highaccuracy localization of multiple targets. The light emitting
diodes (LEDs) intended for illumination are utilized to locate multiple target
mobile terminals equipped with photodetectors. The indoor area can be divided
into a two-dimensional grid of discrete points, and the targets are located in
only a few grid points, which has a sparse property. Thus, the multitarget
localization problem can be transferred into a sparse recovery problem.
Specifically, a CS-based framework is formulated exploiting the superposition
of the received visible light signals at the multiple targets to be located via
intertarget cooperation. Then it can be efficiently resolved using CS-based
algorithms. Moreover, inter-anchor cooperation is introduced to the CS-based
framework by the crosscorrelation between the signals corresponding to
different LEDs, i.e., anchors, which further improves the localization
accuracy. Enabled by the proposed CS-based framework and the devised
cooperation mechanism, the proposed scheme can simultaneously locate multiple
targets with high precision and low computational complexity. Simulation
results show that the proposed schemes can achieve centimeter-level multitarget
positioning with sub-meter accuracy, which outperforms existing benchmark
schemes.

					<dc:description>  Despite their incredible performance, it is well reported that deep neural
networks tend to be overoptimistic about their prediction confidence. Finding
effective and efficient calibration methods for neural networks is therefore an
important endeavour towards better uncertainty quantification in deep learning.
In this manuscript, we introduce a novel calibration technique named
expectation consistency (EC), consisting of a post-training rescaling of the
last layer weights by enforcing that the average validation confidence
coincides with the average proportion of correct labels. First, we show that
the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature scaling
(TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while
requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we
argue that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality
principle known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic
characterization of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their
performance crucially depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss
examples where EC significantly outperforms TS.

					<dc:description>  Empirical welfare analyses often impose stringent parametric assumptions on
individuals' preferences and neglect unobserved preference heterogeneity. In
this paper, we develop a framework to conduct individual and social welfare
analysis for discrete choice that does not suffer from these drawbacks. We
first adapt the class of individual welfare measures introduced by Fleurbaey
(2009) to settings where individual choice is discrete. Allowing for
unrestricted, unobserved preference heterogeneity, these measures become random
variables. We then show that the distribution of these objects can be derived
from choice probabilities, which can be estimated nonparametrically from
cross-sectional data. In addition, we derive nonparametric results for the
joint distribution of welfare and welfare differences, as well as for social
welfare. The former is an important tool in determining whether the winners of
a price change belong disproportionately to those groups who were initially
well-off.

					<dc:description>  Robot control for tactile feedback-based manipulation can be difficult due to
the modeling of physical contacts, partial observability of the environment,
and noise in perception and control. This work focuses on solving partial
observability of contact-rich manipulation tasks as a Sequence-to-Sequence
(Seq2Seq)} Imitation Learning (IL) problem. The proposed Seq2Seq model produces
a robot-environment interaction sequence to estimate the partially observable
environment state variables. Then, the observed interaction sequence is
transformed to a control sequence for the task itself. The proposed Seq2Seq IL
for tactile feedback-based manipulation is experimentally validated on a
door-open task in a simulated environment and a snap-on insertion task with a
real robot. The model is able to learn both tasks from only 50 expert
demonstrations, while state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation
learning methods fail.

					<dc:title>Fast Discrete Fourier Transform algorithms requiring less than 0(NlogN)
  multiplications</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Stasinski, Ryszard</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In the paper it is shown that there exist infinite classes of fast DFT
algorithms having multiplicative complexity lower than O(NlogN), i.e. smaller
than their arithmetical complexity. The derivation starts with nesting of
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of size N = q_1 q_2 ... q_r, where q_i are
powers of prime numbers: DFT is mapped into multidimensional one, Rader
convolutions of q_i-point DFTs extracted, and combined into multidimensional
convolutions processing data in parallel. Crucial to further optimization is
the observation that multiplicative complexity of such algorithm is upper
bounded by 0(Nlog M_max), where M_max is the size of the greatest structure
containing multiplications. Then the size of the structures is diminished:
Firstly, computation of a circular convolution can be done as in Rader-Winograd
algorithms. Secondly, multidimensional convolutions can be computed using
polynomial transforms. It is shown that careful choice of q_i values leads to
important reduction of M_max value: Multiplicative complexity of the new DFT
algorithms is O(Nlog^c log N) for c\le 1, while for more addition-orietnted
ones it is O(Nlog^{1/m} N), m is a natural number denoting class of q_i values.
Smaller values of c, 1/m are obtained for algorithms requiring more additions,
part of algorithms for c = 1, m=2 have arithmetical complexity smaller than
that for the radix-2 FFT for any comparable DFT size, and even lower than that
of split-radix FFT for N\le 65520. The approach can be used for finding
theoretical lower limit on the DFT multiplicative complexity.

					<dc:description>  In a globalized world at the present epoch of generative intelligence, most
of the manual labour tasks are automated with increased efficiency. This can
support businesses to save time and money. A crucial component of generative
intelligence is the integration of vision and language. Consequently, image
captioning become an intriguing area of research. There have been multiple
attempts by the researchers to solve this problem with different deep learning
architectures, although the accuracy has increased, but the results are still
not up to standard. This study buckles down to the comparison of Transformer
and LSTM with attention block model on MS-COCO dataset, which is a standard
dataset for image captioning. For both the models we have used pretrained
Inception-V3 CNN encoder for feature extraction of the images. The Bilingual
Evaluation Understudy score (BLEU) is used to checked the accuracy of caption
generated by both models. Along with the transformer and LSTM with attention
block models,CLIP-diffusion model, M2-Transformer model and the X-Linear
Attention model have been discussed with state of the art accuracy.

					<dc:description>  Background: Daily or weekly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans are
commonly used for accurate patient positioning during the image-guided
radiotherapy (IGRT) process, making it an ideal option for adaptive
radiotherapy (ART) replanning. However, the presence of severe artifacts and
inaccurate Hounsfield unit (HU) values prevent its use for quantitative
applications such as organ segmentation and dose calculation. To enable the
clinical practice of online ART, it is crucial to obtain CBCT scans with a
quality comparable to that of a CT scan. Purpose: This work aims to develop a
conditional diffusion model to perform image translation from the CBCT to the
CT domain for the image quality improvement of CBCT. Methods: The proposed
method is a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that
utilizes a time-embedded U-net architecture with residual and attention blocks
to gradually transform standard Gaussian noise to the target CT distribution
conditioned on the CBCT. The model was trained on deformed planning CT (dpCT)
and CBCT image pairs, and its feasibility was verified in brain patient study
and head-and-neck (H&amp;N) patient study. The performance of the proposed
algorithm was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) and normalized cross-correlation (NCC) metrics on generated
synthetic CT (sCT) samples. The proposed method was also compared to four other
diffusion model-based sCT generation methods. Conclusions: The proposed
conditional DDPM method can generate sCT from CBCT with accurate HU numbers and
reduced artifacts, enabling accurate CBCT-based organ segmentation and dose
calculation for online ART.

					<dc:description>  The problem of packing equal circles in a circle is a classic and famous
packing problem, which is well-studied in academia and has a variety of
applications in industry. This problem is computationally challenging, and
researchers mainly focus on small-scale instances with the number of circular
items n less than 320 in the literature. In this work, we aim to solve this
problem on large scale. Specifically, we propose a novel geometric batch
optimization method that not only can significantly speed up the convergence
process of continuous optimization but also reduce the memory requirement
during the program's runtime. Then we propose a heuristic search method, called
solution-space exploring and descent, that can discover a feasible solution
efficiently on large scale. Besides, we propose an adaptive neighbor object
maintenance method to maintain the neighbor structure applied in the continuous
optimization process. In this way, we can find high-quality solutions on large
scale instances within reasonable computational times. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark instances sampled from n = 300 to 1,000 show that our proposed
algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and performs excellently
on large scale instances. In particular, our algorithm found 10 improved
solutions out of the 21 well-studied moderate scale instances and 95 improved
solutions out of the 101 sampled large scale instances. Furthermore, our
geometric batch optimization, heuristic search, and adaptive maintenance
methods are general and can be adapted to other packing and continuous
optimization problems.

					<dc:description>  Advances in machine learning and neuromorphic systems are fuelled by the
development of architectures required for these applications, such as content

dissipated in its operation, showing it to be below 100pJ per test, comparable
to existing works.

					<dc:description>  Using extensive molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model, we
demonstrate the possibility of sustained unidirectional motion (durotaxis) of
droplets without external energy supply when placed on a polymer brush
substrate with stiffness gradient in a certain direction. The governing key
parameters for the specific substrate design studied, which determine the
durotaxis efficiency, are found to be the grafting density of the brush and the
droplet adhesion to the brush surface, whereas the strength of the stiffness
gradient, the viscosity of the droplet, or the length of the polymer chains of
the brush have only a minor effect on the process. It is shown that this
durotaxial motion is driven by the steady increase of the interfacial energy
between droplet and brush as the droplet moves from softer to stiffer parts of
the substrate whereby the mean driving force gradually declines with decreasing
roughness of the brush surface. We anticipate that our findings indicate
further possibilities in the area of nanoscale motion without external energy
supply.

					<dc:description>  Skyrmions are topologically protected quantum objects at the nanometre scale.
They form perpendicular to an applied magnetic field at a certain temperature
and arrange themselves in a typically hexagonal lattice. Using small angle
neutron scattering we have determined the magnetic field versus temperature
phase diagrams of the stability range of the different magnetic phases, the
helical as well as the skyrmion phases in the multiferroic skyrmion material
Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Therefore, a single crystal was mounted in different crystal
orientations, i.e. unoriented and with the crystallographic $\langle1 1
0\rangle$ and $\langle1 0 0\rangle$ axis aligned parallel to the magnetic
field. Furthermore, different cooling procedures were tested, cooling from the
paramagnetic phase at zero magnetic field and field cooling through the
skyrmion phase where metastable skyrmions are nucleated. From this, not only
were the stability ranges of both the helical and skyrmion phases in this
multiferroic skyrmion material determined, but the length of the spin helix and
the skyrmion distances at different conditions was also determined through
detailed analysis of the positions of the observed Bragg peaks. The obtained
data provide valuable information about the scaling of the skyrmion distances
and therefore their packing density. The knowledge about this tunability will
serve as an important input for the theoretical understanding of the formation
of skyrmions. Concerning technological applications, for example as
high-density data storage devices in information technology, the temperature
and magnetic field dependence of the packing density of skyrmions is of
critical importance for their design. Therefore, the obtained knowledge is an
essential input for future skyrmionics applications in high-density data
storage, in low-energy spintronics or in skyrmionics quantum computation.

					<dc:description>  Quantum-optimal discrimination between one and two closely separated light
sources can be achieved by ideal spatial-mode demultiplexing, simply monitoring
whether a photon is detected in a single antisymmetric mode. However, we show
that for any, no matter how small, imperfections of the demultiplexer, this
simple statistical test becomes practically useless, i.e. as good as flipping a
coin. While we identify a class of separation-independent tests with vanishing
error probabilities in the limit of large numbers of detected photons, they are
generally unreliable beyond that very limit. As a practical alternative, we
propose a simple semi-separation-independent test, which provides a method for
designing reliable experiments, through arbitrary control over the maximal
probability of error.

					<dc:description>  Artificial neural networks have proven to be extremely useful models that
have allowed for multiple recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial
Intelligence and many others. However, they are typically regarded as black
boxes, given how difficult it is for humans to interpret how these models reach
their results. In this work, we propose a method which allows one to modify
what an artificial neural network is perceiving regarding specific
human-defined concepts, enabling the generation of hypothetical scenarios that
could help understand and even debug the neural network model. Through
empirical evaluation, in a synthetic dataset and in the ImageNet dataset, we
test the proposed method on different models, assessing whether the performed
manipulations are well interpreted by the models, and analyzing how they react
to them.

					<dc:description>  Massive random access of devices in the emerging Open Radio Access Network
(O-RAN) brings great challenge to the access control and management. Exploiting
the bursting nature of the access requests, sparse active user detection (SAUD)
is an efficient enabler towards efficient access management, but the sparsity
might be deteriorated in case of uncoordinated massive access requests. To
dynamically preserve the sparsity of access requests, a reinforcement-learning
(RL)-assisted scheme of closed-loop access control utilizing the access class
barring technique is proposed, where the RL policy is determined through
continuous interaction between the RL agent, i.e., a next generation node base
(gNB), and the environment. The proposed scheme can be implemented by the
near-real-time RAN intelligent controller (near-RT RIC) in O-RAN, supporting
rapid switching between heterogeneous vertical applications, such as mMTC and
uRLLC services. Moreover, a data-driven scheme of deep-RL-assisted SAUD is
proposed to resolve highly complex environments with continuous and
high-dimensional state and action spaces, where a replay buffer is applied for
automatic large-scale data collection. An actor-critic framework is formulated
to incorporate the strategy-learning modules into the near-RT RIC. Simulation
results show that the proposed schemes can achieve superior performance in both
access efficiency and user detection accuracy over the benchmark scheme for
different heterogeneous services with massive access requests.

					<dc:description>  We study the supervised learning paradigm called Learning Using Privileged
Information, first suggested by Vapnik and Vashist (2009). In this paradigm, in
addition to the examples and labels, additional (privileged) information is
provided only for training examples. The goal is to use this information to
improve the classification accuracy of the resulting classifier, where this
classifier can only use the non-privileged information of new example instances
to predict their label. We study the theory of privileged learning with the
zero-one loss under the natural Privileged ERM algorithm proposed in Pechyony
and Vapnik (2010a). We provide a counter example to a claim made in that work
regarding the VC dimension of the loss class induced by this problem; We
conclude that the claim is incorrect. We then provide a correct VC dimension
analysis which gives both lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the
Privileged ERM loss class. We further show, via a generalization analysis, that
worst-case guarantees for Privileged ERM cannot improve over standard
non-privileged ERM, unless the capacity of the privileged information is
similar or smaller to that of the non-privileged information. This result
points to an important limitation of the Privileged ERM approach. In our
closing discussion, we suggest another way in which Privileged ERM might still
be helpful, even when the capacity of the privileged information is large.

					<dc:description>  Deepfakes pose an evolving threat to cybersecurity, which calls for the
development of automated countermeasures. While considerable forensic research
has been devoted to the detection and localisation of deepfakes, solutions for
reversing fake to real are yet to be developed. In this study, we introduce
cyber vaccination for conferring immunity to deepfakes. Analogous to biological
vaccination that injects antigens to induce immunity prior to infection by an
actual pathogen, cyber vaccination simulates deepfakes and performs adversarial
training to build a defensive immune system. Aiming at building up
attack-agnostic immunity with limited computational resources, we propose to
simulate various deepfakes with one single overpowered attack: face masking.
The proposed immune system consists of a vaccinator for inducing immunity and a
neutraliser for recovering facial content. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
effective immunity to face replacement, face reenactment and various types of
corruptions.

					<dc:description>  Recently, significant progress has been made in face presentation attack
detection (PAD), which aims to secure face recognition systems against
presentation attacks, owing to the availability of several face PAD datasets.
However, all available datasets are based on privacy and legally-sensitive
authentic biometric data with a limited number of subjects. To target these
legal and technical challenges, this work presents the first synthetic-based
face PAD dataset, named SynthASpoof, as a large-scale PAD development dataset.
The bona fide samples in SynthASpoof are synthetically generated and the attack
samples are collected by presenting such synthetic data to capture systems in a
real attack scenario. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of
using SynthASpoof for the development of face PAD. Moreover, we boost the
performance of such a solution by incorporating the domain generalization tool
MixStyle into the PAD solutions. Additionally, we showed the viability of using
synthetic data as a supplement to enrich the diversity of limited authentic
training data and consistently enhance PAD performances. The SynthASpoof
dataset, containing 25,000 bona fide and 78,800 attack samples, the
implementation, and the pre-trained weights are made publicly available.

					<dc:description>  In the present article we analyze the matter-geometry coupled $f(Q,T)$ theory
of gravity. We offer the fully covariant formulation of the theory, with which
we construct the correct energy balance equation and employ it to conduct a
dynamical system analysis in a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We consider three different
functional forms of the $f(Q,T)$ function, specifically, $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+
\beta T$, $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+ \beta T^2$, and $f(Q,T)=Q+ \alpha Q^2+ \beta T$ .
We attempt to investigate the physical capabilities of these models to describe
various cosmological epochs. We calculate Friedmann-like equations in each case
and introduce some phase space variables to simplify the equations in more
concise forms. We observe that the linear model $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+ \beta T$ with
$\beta=0$ is completely equivalent to the GR case without cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Further, we find that the model $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+ \beta T^2$ with
$\beta \neq 0$ successfully depicts the observed transition from decelerated
phase to an accelerated phase of the universe. Lastly, we find that the model
$f(Q,T)= Q+ \alpha Q^2+ \beta T$ with $\alpha \neq 0$ represents an accelerated
de-Sitter epoch for the constraints $\beta &lt; -1$ or $ \beta \geq 0$.

					<dc:description>  Incompatibility is a feature of quantum theory that sets it apart from
classical theory, and the inability to clone an unknown quantum state is one of
the most fundamental instances. The no-hiding theorem is another such instance
that arises in the context of the black-hole information paradox, and can be
viewed as being dual to no-cloning. Here, we formulate both of these
fundamental features of quantum theory in a single form that is amenable to
efficient verification, and that is robust to errors arising in state
preparation and measurements. We extend the notion of unitarity - an average
figure of merit that for quantum theory captures the coherence of a quantum
channel - to general physical theories. Then, we introduce the notion of
compatible unitarity pair (CUP) sets, that correspond to the allowed values of
unitarities for compatible channels in the theory. We show that a CUP-set
constitutes a simple 'fingerprint' of a physical theory, and that
incompatibility can be studied through them. We derive information-disturbance
constraints on quantum CUP-sets that encode both the no-cloning/broadcasting
and no-hiding theorems of quantum theory. We then develop randomised
benchmarking protocols that efficiently estimate quantum CUP-sets and provide
simulations using IBMQ of the simplest instance. Finally, we discuss ways in
which CUP-sets and quantum no-go theorems could provide additional information
to benchmark quantum devices.

					<dc:description>  The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole is proportional to its horizon
area, hence in $D=2$ spacetime dimensions it is constant because the horizon
degenerates into two points. This fact is consistent with Einstein's gravity
becoming topological in two dimensions. In $F(R)$ gravity, which is non-trivial
even in $D=2$, we find that the entropy is constant, as for Bekenstein-Hawking.
As shown in EPL 139 (2022) no.6, 69001 (arXiv:2208.10146), two-dimensional
$F(R)$ gravity is equivalent to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, in turn equivalent
to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model where the entropy becomes constant in the large
$N$ limit. Several recently proposed entropies are functions of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and become constant in $D=2$, but in two-dimensional
dilaton gravity entropies are not always constant. We study general dilaton
gravity and obtain arbitrary static black hole solutions for which the
non-constant entropies depend on the mass, horizon radius, or Hawking
temperature, and constitute new proposals for a generalized entropy.

					<dc:description>  Agents that plan and act in the real world must deal with the fact that time
passes as they are planning. When timing is tight, there may be insufficient
time to complete the search for a plan before it is time to act. By commencing
execution before search concludes, one gains time to search by making planning
and execution concurrent. However, this incurs the risk of making incorrect
action choices, especially if actions are irreversible. This tradeoff between
opportunity and risk is the problem addressed in this paper. Our main
contribution is to formally define this setting as an abstract metareasoning
problem. We find that the abstract problem is intractable. However, we identify
special cases that are solvable in polynomial time, develop greedy solution
algorithms, and, through tests on instances derived from search problems, find
several methods that achieve promising practical performance. This work lays
the foundation for a principled time-aware executive that concurrently plans
and executes.

					<dc:description>  Heterogeneous graphs provide a compact, efficient, and scalable way to model
data involving multiple disparate modalities. This makes modeling audiovisual
data using heterogeneous graphs an attractive option. However, graph structure
does not appear naturally in audiovisual data. Graphs for audiovisual data are
constructed manually which is both difficult and sub-optimal. In this work, we
address this problem by (i) proposing a parametric graph construction strategy
for the intra-modal edges, and (ii) learning the crossmodal edges. To this end,
we develop a new model, heterogeneous graph crossmodal network (HGCN) that
learns the crossmodal edges. Our proposed model can adapt to various spatial
and temporal scales owing to its parametric construction, while the learnable
crossmodal edges effectively connect the relevant nodes across modalities.
Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (AudioSet) show that our model is
state-of-the-art (0.53 mean average precision), outperforming transformer-based
models and other graph-based models.

					<dc:description>  JPEG images can be further compressed to enhance the storage and transmission
of large-scale image datasets. Existing learned lossless compressors for RGB
images cannot be well transferred to JPEG images due to the distinguishing
distribution of DCT coefficients and raw pixels. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework for learned lossless compression of JPEG images that achieves
end-to-end optimized prediction of the distribution of decoded DCT
coefficients. To enable learning in the frequency domain, DCT coefficients are
partitioned into groups to utilize implicit local redundancy. An
autoencoder-like architecture is designed based on the weight-shared blocks to
realize entropy modeling of grouped DCT coefficients and independently compress
the priors. We attempt to realize learned lossless compression of JPEG images
in the frequency domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves superior or comparable performance in comparison to most
recent lossless compressors with handcrafted context modeling for JPEG images.

					<dc:description>  Science is a cumulative activity, which can manifest itself through the act
of citing. Citations are also central to research evaluation, thus creating
incentives for researchers to cite their own work. Using a dataset containing
more than 63 million articles and 51 million disambiguated authors, this paper
examines the relative importance of self-citations and self-references in the
scholarly communication landscape, their relationship with the age and gender
of authors, as well as their effects on various research evaluation indicators.
Results show that self-citations and self-references evolve in different
directions throughout researchers' careers, and that men and older researchers
are more likely to self-cite. Although self-citations have, on average, a small
to moderate effect on author's citation rates, they highly inflate citations
for a subset of researchers. Comparison of the abstracts of cited and citing
papers to assess the relatedness of different types of citations shows that
self-citations are more similar to each other than other types of citations,
and therefore more relevant. However, researchers that self-reference more tend
to include less relevant citations. The paper concludes with a discussion of
the role of self-citations in scholarly communication.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train models
collaboratively without sharing local data, which has achieved promising
results in different areas, including the Internet of Things (IoT). However,
end IoT devices do not have abilities to automatically annotate their collected
data, which leads to the label shortage issue at the client side. To
collaboratively train an FL model, we can only use a small number of labeled
data stored on the server. This is a new yet practical scenario in federated
learning, i.e., labels-at-server semi-supervised federated learning (SemiFL).
Although several SemiFL approaches have been proposed recently, none of them
can focus on the personalization issue in their model design. IoT environments
make SemiFL more challenging, as we need to take device computational
constraints and communication cost into consideration simultaneously. To tackle
these new challenges together, we propose a novel SemiFL framework named
pFedKnow. pFedKnow generates lightweight personalized client models via neural
network pruning techniques to reduce communication cost. Moreover, it
incorporates pretrained large models as prior knowledge to guide the
aggregation of personalized client models and further enhance the framework
performance. Experiment results on both image and text datasets show that the
proposed pFedKnow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines as well as reducing
considerable communication cost. The source code of the proposed pFedKnow is
available at https://github.com/JackqqWang/pfedknow/tree/master.

					<dc:description>  Recent works have shown that deep learning (DL) models can effectively learn
city-wide crowd-flow patterns, which can be used for more effective urban
planning and smart city management. However, DL models have been known to
perform poorly on inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. Although many works
have studied these adversarial perturbations in general, the adversarial
vulnerabilities of deep crowd-flow prediction models in particular have
remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of
the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based crowd-flow prediction models under
multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions. (1) We propose
CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties - Consistency and
Validity - of the crowd-flow prediction inputs that enable the detection of
standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR). (2) We
leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss
to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense. (3) We
propose CVPR, a Consistent, Valid and Physically-Realizable adversarial attack,
that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation
generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to
simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is
in place. We also show that CVPR attack considerably outperforms the adaptively
modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with
useful insights emerging from our work and highlight promising future research
directions.

					<dc:description>  Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a faithful reformulation of the
physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as a topological heavy
fermion problem, involving the hybridization of flat band f-electrons with a
topological band of conduction electrons. Here we explore the consequences of
this analogy, using it to reformulate the SB model as a mixed valence model for
twisted bilayer graphene. We show how the interaction with the conduction sea
behaves as a U(8) Kondo Lattice at high energies and a U(4) Kondo lattice at
low energies. One of the robust consequences of the model, is the prediction
that underlying hybridization scale of the mixed valent model and the the width
of the upper and lower Hubbard bands will scale linearly with energy. We also
find that the bare hybridization $\gamma_{0}$ predicted by the SB model is too
large to account for the observed local moment behavior at large filling
factor, leading us to suggest that the bare hybridization is renormalized by
the soft polaronic response of the underlying graphene.

					<dc:description>  Morphogenesis in development involves significant morphological transitions
toward the emerging body plan of a mature animal. Understanding how the
collective physical processes drive robust morphological patterning requires
the characterization of the underlying relevant fields. Calcium (Ca2+) is known
to be such a field. Here we show that the Ca2+ spatial fluctuations, in
whole-body Hydra regeneration, exhibit universal properties captured by a
field-theoretic model describing fluctuations in a tilted double-well
potential. We utilize an external electric field and Heptanol, a drug blocking
gap junctions, as two separate controls affecting the Ca2+ activity and pausing
the regeneration process in a reversible way. Subjecting the Hydra tissue to an
electric field increases the calcium activity and its spatial correlations,
while applying Heptanol inhibits the activity and weakens the spatial
correlations. Statistical characteristics of the Ca2+ spatial fluctuations,
i.e., the coefficient of variation and the skewness, exhibit universal shape
distributions across tissue samples and conditions, demonstrating the existence
of global constraints over this field. Our analysis shows that the Hydra's
tissue resides near the onset of bistability. The controls modulate the
dynamics near that onset in a way that preserves the tissue's ability to
regenerate, which is reflected by the aforementioned universality.

					<dc:description>  This work addresses the issue of motion compensation and pattern tracking in
event camera data. An event camera generates asynchronous streams of events
triggered independently by each of the pixels upon changes in the observed
intensity. Providing great advantages in low-light and rapid-motion scenarios,
such unconventional data present significant research challenges as traditional
vision algorithms are not directly applicable to this sensing modality. The
proposed method decomposes the tracking problem into a local SE(2)
motion-compensation step followed by a homography registration of small
motion-compensated event batches. The first component relies on Gaussian
Process (GP) theory to model the continuous occupancy field of the events in
the image plane and embed the camera trajectory in the covariance kernel
function. In doing so, estimating the trajectory is done similarly to GP
hyperparameter learning by maximising the log marginal likelihood of the data.
The continuous occupancy fields are turned into distance fields and used as
templates for homography-based registration. By benchmarking the proposed
method against other state-of-the-art techniques, we show that our open-source
implementation performs high-accuracy motion compensation and produces
high-quality tracks in real-world scenarios.

					<dc:description>  The wide deployment of speech-based biometric systems usually demands
high-performance speaker recognition algorithms. However, most of the prior
works for speaker recognition either process the speech in the frequency domain
or time domain, which may produce suboptimal results because both time and
frequency domains are important for speaker recognition. In this paper, we
attempt to analyze the speech signal in both time and frequency domains and
propose the time-frequency network~(TFN) for speaker recognition by extracting
and fusing the features in the two domains. Based on the recent advance of deep
neural networks, we propose a convolution neural network to encode the raw
speech waveform and the frequency spectrum into domain-specific features, which
are then fused and transformed into a classification feature space for speaker
recognition. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets TIMIT and
LibriSpeech show that our framework is effective to combine the information in
the two domains and performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for
speaker recognition.

					<dc:description>  The ability to change significantly mechanical and wave propagation
properties of a structure without rebuilding it has been one of the main
challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the
enormous appeal that, especially in the case of micro-scale systems, such
tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from
biomedical to protective devices. In this work, a novel micro-scale mechanical
metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of
configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative
Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a
highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps, at the
same time, can be controlled, which can be very useful in the design of
vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is shown experimentally that
reconfiguration of the system, leading to a change in its properties, can be
induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field, thanks
to appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the scattering theory of two particles in a generic
$D$-dimensional space. For the s-wave problem, by adopting an on-shell
approximation for the $T$-matrix equation, we derive analytical formulas which
connect the Fourier transform ${\tilde V}(k)$ of the interaction potential to
the s-wave phase shift. In this way we obtain explicit expressions of the
low-momentum parameters ${\tilde g}_0$ and ${\tilde g}_2$ of ${\tilde
V}(k)={\tilde g}_0+{\tilde g}_2k^2 +...$ in terms of the s-wave scattering
length $a_s$ and the s-wave effective range $r_s$ for $D=3$, $D=2$, and $D=1$.
Our results, which are strongly dependent on the spatial dimension $D$, are a
useful benchmark for few-body and many-body calculations. As a specific
application, we derive the zero-temperature pressure of a 2D uniform
interacting Bose gas with a beyond-mean-field correction which includes both
scattering length and effective range.

					<dc:title>Mining both Commonality and Specificity from Multiple Documents for

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The multi-document summarization task requires the designed summarizer to
generate a short text that covers the important information of original
documents and satisfies content diversity. This paper proposes a multi-document
summarization approach based on hierarchical clustering of documents. It
utilizes the constructed class tree of documents to extract both the sentences
reflecting the commonality of all documents and the sentences reflecting the
specificity of some subclasses of these documents for generating a summary, so
as to satisfy the coverage and diversity requirements of multi-document
summarization. Comparative experiments with different variant approaches on
DUC'2002-2004 datasets prove the effectiveness of mining both the commonality
and specificity of documents for multi-document summarization. Experiments on
DUC'2004 and Multi-News datasets show that our approach achieves competitive
performance compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised
approaches.

					<dc:description>  If the origin of life is rare and sensitive to the local conditions at the
site of its emergence, then, using the principle of mediocrity within a
multiverse framework, we may expect to find ourselves in a universe that is
better than usual at creating these necessary conditions. We use this reasoning
to investigate several origin of life scenarios to determine whether they are
compatible with the multiverse, including the prebiotic soup scenario,
hydrothermal vents, delivery of prebiotic material from impacts, and
panspermia. We find that most of these scenarios induce a preference toward
weaker-gravity universes, and that panspermia and scenarios involving solar
radiation or large impacts as a disequilibrium source are disfavored.
Additionally, we show that several hypothesized habitability criteria which are
disfavored when the origin of life is not taken into account become compatible
with the multiverse, and that the emergence of life and emergence of
intelligence cannot both be sensitive to disequilibrium production conditions.

meta-analysis of DTA. Some statistical methods have been developed to deal with
PB in meta-analysis of DTA, but implementing these methods requires high-level
statistical knowledge and programming skill. To assist non-technical users in
running most routines in meta-analysis of DTA and handling with PB, we
developed an interactive application, DTAmetasa. DTAmetasa is developed with
the web-based graphical user interface based on the R shiny framework. It
allows users to upload data and conduct meta-analysis of DTA by &quot;point and
click&quot; operations. Moreover, DTAmetasa provides the sensitivity analysis of PB
and presents the graphical results to evaluate the magnitude of the PB under
various publication mechanisms. In this study, we introduce the functionalities
of DTAmetasa and use the real-world meta-analysis to show its capacity for
dealing with PB.

					<dc:description>  In the Dynamical Scotogenic Model, the global $B-L$ symmetry is supposed to
be broken spontaneously resulting in a massless Goldstone boson called majoron,
and massive right handed neutrinos which participate in the generation of light
neutrino massses at one-loop. One of them being the lightest stable particle
can be a thermal dark matter candidate. We discuss how the dark matter
phenomenology differs from the original Scotogenic model, taking into account
all the constraints coming from the observed neutrino masses and mixing, lepton
flavor violations such as $\mu \to e\gamma, \mu \to e J$, astrophysical and
cosmological observations of stellar cooling and $N_{eff}$, as well as collider
signatures such as Higgs invisible decays. We find that the dark matter
annihilation to majorons plays an important role to produce the right relic
abundance.

					<dc:description>  Integrating multiple LiDAR sensors can significantly enhance a robot's
perception of the environment, enabling it to capture adequate measurements for
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Indeed, solid-state LiDARs can
bring in high resolution at a low cost to traditional spinning LiDARs in
robotic applications. However, their reduced field of view (FoV) limits
performance, particularly indoors. In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled
multi-modal multi-LiDAR-inertial SLAM system for surveying and mapping tasks.
By taking advantage of both solid-state and spinnings LiDARs, and built-in
inertial measurement units (IMU), we achieve both robust and low-drift
ego-estimation as well as high-resolution maps in diverse challenging indoor
environments (e.g., small, featureless rooms). First, we use spatial-temporal
calibration modules to align the timestamp and calibrate extrinsic parameters
between sensors. Then, we extract two groups of feature points including edge
and plane points, from LiDAR data. Next, with pre-integrated IMU data, an
undistortion module is applied to the LiDAR point cloud data. Finally, the
undistorted point clouds are merged into one point cloud and processed with a
sliding window based optimization module. From extensive experiment results,
our method shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art
spinning-LiDAR-only or solid-state-LiDAR-only SLAM systems in diverse
environments. More results, code, and dataset can be found at

					<dc:description>  Stellar spectra contain a large amount of information about the conditions in
stellar atmospheres. However, extracting this information is challenging and
demands comprehensive numerical modelling. Here, we present stellar spectra
synthesized using the recently developed state-of-the-art MPS-ATLAS code on a
fine grid of stellar fundamental parameters. These calculations have been
extensively validated against solar and stellar observations and can be used
for various astrophysical applications. The spectra are available at the Max
Planck Digital Library (MPDL,
https://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17617/3.NJ56TR)
and have been also incorporated into the ExoTiC-LD python package
(https://github.com/Exo-TiC/ExoTiC-LD/) which returns stellar limb darkening
coefficients used for the software package Exoplanet Timeseries
Characterisation (ExoTic).

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper develops the genuinely multidimensional HLL Riemann solver for the
two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic equations on Cartesian meshes
and studies its physical-constraint preserving (PCP) property. Based on the
resulting HLL solver, the first- and high-order accurate PCP finite volume
schemes are proposed. In the high-order scheme, the WENO reconstruction, the
third-order accurate strong-stability-preserving time discretizations and the
PCP flux limiter are used. Several numerical results are given to demonstrate
the accuracy, performance and resolution of the shock waves etc. as well as the
genuinely multi-dimensional wave structures of our PCP finite volume schemes.

					<dc:description>  In parameterized complexity, it is well-known that a parameterized problem is
fixed-parameter tractable if and only if it has a kernel - an instance
equivalent to the input instance, whose size is just a function of the
parameter. The size of the kernel can be exponential or worse, resulting in a
quest for fixed-parameter tractable problems with a polynomial-sized kernel.
The developments in machinery to show lower bounds for the sizes of the kernel
gave rise to the question of the asymptotically optimum size for the kernel of
fixed-parameter tractable problems. In this article, we survey a tool called
expansion lemma that helps in reducing the size of the kernel. Its early origin
is in the form of Crown Decomposition for obtaining linear kernel for the
Vertex Cover problem and the specific lemma was identified as the tool behind
an optimal kernel with O(k^2) vertices and edges for the UNDIRECTED FEEDBACK
VERTEX SET problem. Since then, several variations and extensions of the tool
have been discovered. We survey them along with their applications in this
article.

					<dc:description>  The statistical nature of discrete fluid molecules with random thermal motion
so far has not been considered in mainstream fluid mechanics based on
Navier-Stokes equations, wherein fluids have been treated as a continuum
breaking into many macroscopically infinitely small (but microscopically large
enough) mass elements with their motion only characterized by center-of-mass
velocity. Here we provide a Statistical Mechanical approach to address fluid
dynamics by considering statistical velocity distribution of discrete molecules
within macroscopically infinitely small volume elements as well as their
center-of-mass velocity. Dynamics equations governing the evolution of physical
variables have been proposed, Green's functions have been obtained and linear
response theory has been applied to study physical situations with external
heat perturbation. It is found that the propagation of heat, center-of-mass
motion and sound are intrinsically integrated in Statistical fluid dynamics.
This work lays down the foundation for applications of Statistical fluid
mechanics.

					<dc:description>  Non-stationary parametric bandits have attracted much attention recently.
There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including
sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary
environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is
commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical
studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either
computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits
the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits
(LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret
analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a
refined analysis framework, which simplifies the derivation and importantly
produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as
window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous
studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of
other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and
Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB
algorithm with an $\widetilde{O}(k_\mu^{\frac{5}{4}} c_\mu^{-\frac{3}{4}}
d^{\frac{3}{4}} P_T^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret, improving the
$\widetilde{O}(k_\mu^{2} c_\mu^{-1}d^{\frac{9}{10}}
P_T^{\frac{1}{5}}T^{\frac{4}{5}})$ bound in prior work, where $k_\mu$ and
$c_\mu$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the
non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon.

					<dc:description>  3D convolution neural networks (CNNs) have been the prevailing option for
video recognition. To capture the temporal information, 3D convolutions are
computed along the sequences, leading to cubically growing and expensive
computations. To reduce the computational cost, previous methods resort to
manually designed 3D/2D CNN structures with approximations or automatic search,
which sacrifice the modeling ability or make training time-consuming. In this
work, we propose to automatically design efficient 3D CNN architectures via a
novel training-free neural architecture search approach tailored for 3D CNNs
considering the model complexity. To measure the expressiveness of 3D CNNs
efficiently, we formulate a 3D CNN as an information system and derive an
analytic entropy score, based on the Maximum Entropy Principle. Specifically,
we propose a spatio-temporal entropy score (STEntr-Score) with a refinement
factor to handle the discrepancy of visual information in spatial and temporal
dimensions, through dynamically leveraging the correlation between the feature
map size and kernel size depth-wisely. Highly efficient and expressive 3D CNN
architectures, \ie entropy-based 3D CNNs (E3D family), can then be efficiently
searched by maximizing the STEntr-Score under a given computational budget, via
an evolutionary algorithm without training the network parameters. Extensive
experiments on Something-Something V1\&amp;V2 and Kinetics400 demonstrate that the
E3D family achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher computational
efficiency. Code is available at

					<dc:description>  Deep learning frameworks (DLFs) have been playing an increasingly important
role in this intelligence age since they act as a basic infrastructure for an
increasingly wide range of AIbased applications. Meanwhile, as
multi-programming-language (MPL) software systems, DLFs are inevitably
suffering from bugs caused by the use of multiple programming languages (PLs).
Hence, it is of paramount significance to understand the bugs (especially the
bugs involving multiple PLs, i.e., MPL bugs) of DLFs, which can provide a
foundation for preventing, detecting, and resolving bugs in the development of
DLFs. To this end, we manually analyzed 1497 bugs in three MPL DLFs, namely
MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. First, we classified bugs in these DLFs into 12
types (e.g., algorithm design bugs and memory bugs) according to their bug
labels and characteristics. Second, we further explored the impacts of
different bug types on the development of DLFs, and found that deployment bugs
and memory bugs negatively impact the development of DLFs in different aspects
the most. Third, we found that 28.6%, 31.4%, and 16.0% of bugs in MXNet,
PyTorch, and TensorFlow are MPL bugs, respectively; the PL combination of
Python and C/C++ is most used in fixing more than 92% MPL bugs in all DLFs.
Finally, the code change complexity of MPL bug fixes is significantly greater
than that of single-programming-language (SPL) bug fixes in all the three DLFs,
while in PyTorch MPL bug fixes have longer open time and greater communication
complexity than SPL bug fixes. These results provide insights for bug
management in DLFs.

					<dc:description>  This paper clarifies basic definitions in the universal construction of
topological theories and monoidal categories. The definition of the universal
construction is given for various types of monoidal categories, including rigid
and symmetric. It is also explained how to set up the universal construction
for non-monoidal categories. The second part of the paper explains how to
associate a rigid symmetric monoidal category to a small category, a sort of
the Brauer envelope of a category. The universal construction for the Brauer
envelopes generalizes some earlier work of the first two authors on automata,
power series and topological theories. Finally, the theory of pseudocharacters
(or pseudo-representations), which is an essential tool in modern number
theory, is interpreted via one-dimensional topological theories and TQFTs with
defects. The notion of a pseudocharacter is studied for Brauer categories and
the lifting property to characters of semisimple representations is established
in characteristic 0 for Brauer categories with at most countably many objects.
The paper contains a brief discussion of pseudo-holonomies, which are functions
from loops in a manifold to real numbers similar to traces of the holonomies
along loops of a connection on a vector bundle on the manifold. It concludes
with a classification of pseudocharacters (pseudo-TQFTs) and their generating
functions for the category of oriented two-dimensional cobordisms in the
characteristic 0 case.

					<dc:description>  Flocking behavior is observed in biological systems from the cellular to
super-organismal length scales, and the mechanisms and purposes of this
behavior are objects of intense interest. In this paper, we study the
collective dynamics of bovine sperm cells in a viscoelastic fluid. Remarkably,
these cells appear not to spontaneously flock, but transition into a long-lived
flocking phase after being exposed to a transient ordering pulse of fluid flow.
Surprisingly, this induced flocking phase exhibits anisotropic giant number
fluctuations and possesses transverse density fluctuation correlations
consistent with the Toner-Tu theory of the polar fluid phase, despite the
clearly important role of momentum conservation between the swimmers and the
surrounding fluid in these experiments. In addition to these flow-induced
flocking states, we also find a self-organized global vortex state of the sperm
cells. We simulate this system, modeling the sperm as persistently turning
active particles. Although the model does not reproduce the vortex state, it
exhibits a polar-disorder phase boundary as a function of cell density and
persistence time that is predictive of the experimental phase boundary. Our
results may have implications for the evaluation of sample fertility by
studying the collective phase behavior of dense groups of swimming sperm.

					<dc:description>  GraNNI (Grassmannians for Nearest Neighbours Identification) a new algorithm

					<dc:description>  In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of learning-based single-view
3D hair modeling. Due to the great difficulty of collecting paired real image
and 3D hair data, using synthetic data to provide prior knowledge for real
domain becomes a leading solution. This unfortunately introduces the challenge
of domain gap. Due to the inherent difficulty of realistic hair rendering,
existing methods typically use orientation maps instead of hair images as input
to bridge the gap. We firmly think an intermediate representation is essential,
but we argue that orientation map using the dominant filtering-based methods is
sensitive to uncertain noise and far from a competent representation. Thus, we
first raise this issue up and propose a novel intermediate representation,
termed as HairStep, which consists of a strand map and a depth map. It is found
that HairStep not only provides sufficient information for accurate 3D hair
modeling, but also is feasible to be inferred from real images. Specifically,
we collect a dataset of 1,250 portrait images with two types of annotations. A
learning framework is further designed to transfer real images to the strand
map and depth map. It is noted that, an extra bonus of our new dataset is the
first quantitative metric for 3D hair modeling. Our experiments show that
HairStep narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D hair reconstruction.

					<dc:description>  The origin of octupole deformation for even-even nuclei near the
doubly-closed shell configurations are investigated by means of the
semiclassical periodic orbit theory. In order to focus on the change of shell
structure due to deformation, a simple infinite-well potential model is
employed with octupole shape parametrized by merging a sphere and a paraboloid.
Attention is paid to the contributions of the degenerate families of periodic
orbits (POs) confined in the spherical portion of the potential, that are
expected to partially preserve the spherical shell effect up to considerably
large value of the octupole parameter. The contribution of those POs to the
semiclassical trace formula plays an important role in bringing about shell
energy gain due to octupole deformation in the system with a few particles
added to spherical closed-shell configurations.

					<dc:description>  In this study, charged AdS black holes with a string cloud are taken into
consideration. We identify three distinct black hole solutions within a
specific temperature range, which subsequently merge into a single black hole
beyond this range in the case of spherical space with low chemical potential
and string density. However, in the case of large chemical potential and string
density, only one black hole solution exists for all temperatures. Notably, we
observe that for flat and hyperbolic space, there is only one black hole
solution irrespective of the chemical potential and string density. By
subtracting the contribution of the extremal black hole from the on-shell
Euclidean action, the thermodynamical quantities associated with these black
holes are calculated. We also investigate the stability of these black holes
and find that medium-sized black hole is unstable. Finally, we establish the
Cardy-Verlinde formula for the corresponding dual boundary theory.

					<dc:description>  Studies of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of galactic magnetic fields
are now entering a new era, with broadband, highly sensitive radio observations
and new analysis methods. To reveal the magnetic field configuration from the
observed value integrated along the line of sight, it is necessary to derive an
appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics. We aim
to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial
distribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results. In particular, we focus on using
the depolarization effect to verify the polarization model and to identify the
emission region. First, we show that wavelength-independent depolarization,
which takes into account anisotropic turbulence, does not work efficiently
because the polarized emission is stronger in regions of ordered spiral fields
than in regions dominated by isotropic turbulent fields. Beam depolarization
becomes more effective below 1 GHz. Although close to the equatorial plane
there will be strong depolarization which increases with observing wavelength,
this effect is less in the halo, making halo magnetic fields detectable through
their polarized emission at meter-wavelength bands. Although polarized emission
from the halo is below the detection limit of current facilities, it will be
detectable within the SKA era. In addition, we found that the spiral
polarization projected on a screen is produced by overlapping magnetic flux
tubes extending to different heights from the equatorial plane. This suggests
that the traditional classification of global magnetic fields has difficulty
reproducing the global structure of the magnetic fields. Finally, we
demonstrate the method to separate magnetic flux tubes at different heights by

					<dc:description>  One of the most crucial yet poorly constrained parameters in modelling the
ionizing emissivity is the escape fraction of photons from star-forming
galaxies. Several theoretical and observational studies have been conducted
over the past few years, but consensus regarding its redshift evolution has yet
to be achieved. We present here the first non-parametric reconstruction of this
parameter as a function of redshift from a data-driven reionization model using
a Gaussian Process Regression method. Our finding suggests a mild redshift
evolution of escape fraction with a mean value of $4\%,7\%,\sim10\%$ at
$z=2,6,12$. However, a constant escape fraction of $6-10\%$ at $z\gtrsim 6$ is
still allowed by current data and also matches other reionization-related
observations. With the detection of fainter high redshift galaxies from
upcoming observations of JWST, the approach presented here will be a robust
tool to put the most stringent constraint on escape fraction as well as
reionization histories.

if $R$ is such a ring then the iterated local cohomology modules $H^{n_1}_{I_1}

that all local cohomology modules $H^n_I(R / gR)$ have closed support when $g$
is a nonzerodivisor on $R$.

					<dc:description>  Plasmon-mediated superradiance for molecules around metallic nanospheres was
proposed ten years ago. However, its demonstration has not been achieved yet
due to the experimental difficulty of positioning molecules, and the
theoretical limitation to the enhanced collective rate of low excited
molecules. In this Letter, we propose that the ultrafast plasmon-mediated
superradiant pulses can be observed with strongly excited methylene blue
molecules standing vertically inside gold nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavities.
Our simulations indicate that in this system the molecules could interact with
each other via plasmon- and free-space mediated coherent and dissipative
coupling. More importantly, the coherent coupling mediated by short-ranged
propagating surface plasmons cancel largely the direct dipole-dipole coupling
mediated by the free-space field, and the dominated dissipative coupling
mediated by relatively long-ranged gap plasmons enables the ultrafast
superradiant pulses within picosecond scale. Our study opens up the possibility
of studying the rich superradiant effects from the quantum emitters in a
sub-wavelength volumn by engineering the plasmonic environments.

					<dc:title>FQP 2.0: Industry Trend Analysis via Hierarchical Financial Data</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Zhu, Hongyin</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Analyzing trends across industries is critical to maintaining a healthy and
stable economy. Previous research has mainly analyzed official statistics,
which are more accurate but not necessarily real-time. In this paper, we
propose a method for analyzing industry trends using stock market data. The
difficulty of this task is that the raw data is relatively noisy, which affects
the accuracy of statistical analysis. In addition, textual data for industry
analysis needs to be better understood through language models. For this
reason, we introduce the method of industry trend analysis from two
perspectives of explicit analysis and implicit analysis. For the explicit
analysis, we introduce a hierarchical data (industry and listed company)
analysis method to reduce the impact of noise. For implicit analysis, we
further pre-train GPT-2 to analyze industry trends with current affairs
background as input, making full use of the knowledge learned in the
pre-training corpus. We conduct experiments based on the proposed method and
achieve good industry trend analysis results.

					<dc:description>  Tactile pose estimation and tactile servoing are fundamental capabilities of
robot touch. Reliable and precise pose estimation can be provided by applying
deep learning models to high-resolution optical tactile sensors. Given the
recent successes of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the effectiveness of Voronoi
features, we developed a Tactile Voronoi Graph Neural Network (Tac-VGNN) to
achieve reliable pose-based tactile servoing relying on a biomimetic optical
tactile sensor (TacTip). The GNN is well suited to modeling the distribution
relationship between shear motions of the tactile markers, while the Voronoi
diagram supplements this with area-based tactile features related to contact
depth. The experiment results showed that the Tac-VGNN model can help enhance
data interpretability during graph generation and model training efficiency
significantly than CNN-based methods. It also improved pose estimation accuracy
along vertical depth by 28.57% over vanilla GNN without Voronoi features and
achieved better performance on the real surface following tasks with smoother
robot control trajectories. For more project details, please view our website:

					<dc:subject>39B62 (Primary) 53C50, 34A05 (Secondary)</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We prove the following sharp Sobolev inequality on the circle
$$\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} [4(v')^2 - v^2] \mathrm{d} \theta \geq -
\frac{4\pi^2}{\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} v^{-2} \mathrm{d} \theta},$$ with the
equality being achieved when $v^{-2} (\theta) = \frac{k\sqrt{1-\alpha^2}}{1+
\alpha \cos(\theta - \theta_o)}$where$k&gt;0$, $\alpha \in (-1,1)$, $\theta_0 \in
\mathbb{R}$. If $v$ vanishes somewhere on the circle, then $$4
\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} (v')^2 \mathrm{d} \theta \geq\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} v^2
\mathrm{d} \theta.$$ The basic tools to prove the inequality are the
rearrangement inequality on the circle and the variational method. We
investigate the variational problem of the functional $\mathcal{F}[v] =
\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} [4(v')^2 - v^2] \mathrm{d} \theta$ under the constraint
$\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} v^{-2} \mathrm{d} \theta = 2\pi$. An important geometric
insight of the functional $\mathcal{F}$ is that it is invariant under the
Lorentz group, since $\mathcal{F}[v]$ is the integral of the product of two
null expansions of a spacelike curve parameterised by the function $v^{-2}$ in
a lightcone in $3$-dim Minkowski spacetime. The global minimiser of
$\mathcal{F}$ under the constraint is simply given by the spacelike plane
section of the lightcone. We introduce a method which combines the symmetric
decreasing rearrangement and the Lorentz transformation. This method isnot
confined to the scope of this paper, but is applicable to other Lorentz
invariant variational problems on $\mathbb{S}^{n}, n \geq 1$. As an example, we
sketch a proof of the sharp Sobolev inequality on $\mathbb{S}^n, n\geq 3$ by
this method.

					<dc:description>  While the vast majority of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) has been identified
by wide-field sky surveys in the optical and X-ray bands, recent studies
indicate that a considerable fraction of TDEs may be dust obscured, and thus
preferentially detected in the infrared (IR) wavebands. In this Letter, we
present the discovery of a luminous mid-IR nuclear flare (termed WTP 14adbjsh)
identified in a systematic transient search of archival images from the NEOWISE
mid-IR survey. The source reached a peak luminosity of $L \simeq 10^{43}
\text{erg s}^{-1}$ at 4.6 ${\mu}$m in 2015, before fading in the IR with a
TDE-like $F \propto t^{-5/3}$ decline, radiating a total of more than $ 3\times
10^{51}$ erg in the last 7 years. The transient event took place in the nearby
galaxy NGC 7392, at a distance of around 42 Mpc; yet, no optical or X-ray flare
is detected. We interpret the transient as the nearest TDE candidate detected
in the last decade, which was missed at other wavelengths due to dust
obscuration, hinting at the existence of TDEs that have been historically
overlooked. Unlike most previously detected TDEs, the transient was discovered
in a star forming galaxy, corroborating earlier suggestions that dust
obscuration suppresses significantly the detection of TDEs in these
environments. Our results demonstrate that the study of IR-detected TDEs is
critical in order to obtain a complete understanding of the physics of TDEs,
and to conclude whether TDEs occur preferentially in a particular class of
galaxies.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study the phases of Yukawa theories at weak coupling and the Gross-Neveu
models in AdS spaces at zero and finite temperature. Following the method used
in \cite{Kakkar:2022hub}, we first compute the one-loop partition functions,
using the generalized eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on Euclidean AdS in the
Poincar\'e coordinates. These functions satisfy desired periodicities under
thermal identification. The method replicates results for partition functions
known in the literature. We then study the phases of these field theories with
fermions as regions in the corresponding parameter spaces at zero temperature.
The phases and the corresponding phase boundaries are further identified as a
function of the mass-squared of the scalar field and temperature for the Yukawa
theories. While for the Gross-Neveu models, the changes in the phases as a
function of the fermionic mass and the coupling constant at finite temperature
are discussed. The Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model is studied for AdS$_4$. We also
note certain deviations from phases of these theories in flat space.

					<dc:description>  We present a suite of compilation methods to simplify the effects of errors
on the output of a noisy quantum circuit. These apply quantum circuit
parallelisation to simplify the errors in two distinct ways. In the first,
error simplification is achieved by symmetrisation; and in the second by
randomisation. Initially the case of a single error channel is analysed, this
is then generalised to multiple error channels. For each method, a number of
different types of reduction are described along with their necessary
assumptions. The degree of error simplification for each compilation method is
shown to be either constant, linear or exponential, in terms of system size.
Finally, some example applications are provided, along with experiments run on
superconducting quantum hardware.

					<dc:description>  Fast distributed algorithms that output a feasible solution for constraint
satisfaction problems, such as maximal independent sets, have been heavily
studied. There has been much less research on distributed sampling problems,
where one wants to sample from a distribution over all feasible solutions
(e.g., uniformly sampling a feasible solution). Recent work (Feng, Sun, Yin
PODC 2017; Fischer and Ghaffari DISC 2018; Feng, Hayes, and Yin arXiv 2018) has
shown that for some constraint satisfaction problems there are distributed
Markov chains that mix in $O(\log n)$ rounds in the classical LOCAL model of
distributed computation. However, these methods return samples from a
distribution close to the desired distribution, but with some small amount of
error. In this paper, we focus on the problem of exact distributed sampling.
Our main contribution is to show that these distributed Markov chains in tandem
with techniques from the sequential setting, namely coupling from the past and
bounding chains, can be used to design $O(\log n)$-round LOCAL model exact
sampling algorithms for a class of weighted local constraint satisfaction
problems. This general result leads to $O(\log n)$-round exact sampling
algorithms that use small messages (i.e., run in the CONGEST model) and
polynomial-time local computation for some important special cases, such as
sampling weighted independent sets (aka the hardcore model) and weighted
dominating sets.

					<dc:description>  Today, deep learning represents the most popular and successful form of
machine learning. Deep learning has revolutionised the field of pattern
recognition, including biometric recognition. Biometric systems utilising deep
learning have been shown to achieve auspicious recognition accuracy, surpassing
human performance. Apart from said breakthrough advances in terms of biometric
performance, the use of deep learning was reported to impact different
covariates of biometrics such as algorithmic fairness, vulnerability to
attacks, or template protection. Technologies of biometric template protection
are designed to enable a secure and privacy-preserving deployment of
biometrics. In the recent past, deep learning techniques have been frequently
applied in biometric template protection systems for various purposes. This
work provides an overview of how advances in deep learning take influence on
the field of biometric template protection. The interrelation between improved
biometric performance rates and security in biometric template protection is
elaborated. Further, the use of deep learning for obtaining feature
representations that are suitable for biometric template protection is
discussed. Novel methods that apply deep learning to achieve various goals of
biometric template protection are surveyed along with deep learning-based
attacks.

					<dc:description>  Analysing weighted networks requires modelling the binary and weighted
properties simultaneously. We highlight three approaches for estimating the
parameters responsible for them: econometric techniques treating topology as
deterministic and statistical techniques either ensemble-averaging parameters
or maximising an averaged likelihood over the topological randomness. In
homogeneous networks, equivalence holds; in heterogeneous networks, the local
disorder breaks it, in a way reminiscent of the difference between quenched and
annealed averages in the physics of disordered systems.

					<dc:description>  Relative pose regressors (RPRs) localize a camera by estimating its relative
translation and rotation to a pose-labelled reference. Unlike scene coordinate
regression and absolute pose regression methods, which learn absolute scene
parameters, RPRs can (theoretically) localize in unseen environments, since
they only learn the residual pose between camera pairs. In practice, however,
the performance of RPRs is significantly degraded in unseen scenes. In this
work, we propose to aggregate paired feature maps into latent codes, instead of
operating on global image descriptors, in order to improve the generalization
of RPRs. We implement aggregation with concatenation, projection, and attention
operations (Transformer Encoders) and learn to regress the relative pose
parameters from the resulting latent codes. We further make use of a recently
proposed continuous representation of rotation matrices, which alleviates the
limitations of the commonly used quaternions. Compared to state-of-the-art
RPRs, our model is shown to localize significantly better in unseen
environments, across both indoor and outdoor benchmarks, while maintaining
competitive performance in seen scenes. We validate our findings and
architecture design through multiple ablations. Our code and pretrained models
is publicly available.

					<dc:description>  Our earlier work [J. Opt. 19. (2017) 0905603] showed that, in contrast to the
four parameters of the traditional Stokes vector description of the statistics
of the partially polarized light, the complete second-order statistics of the
narrow-band polarized wave is characterized by thirteen parameters. Here we
analyze the second-order statistics of the radiation from a randomly rotating
source of the electromagnetic radiation, and show that it includes a covariance
of the right and left circular polarizations that is not captured by the Stokes
vector formalism. We illustrate this finding on a simple example of rotating
quadrupole.

					<dc:description>  Recent work has explored using self-supervised learning (SSL) speech
representations such as wav2vec2.0 as the representation medium in standard
two-stage TTS, in place of conventionally used mel-spectrograms. It is however
unclear which speech SSL is the better fit for TTS, and whether or not the
performance differs between read and spontaneous TTS, the later of which is
arguably more challenging. This study aims at addressing these questions by
testing several speech SSLs, including different layers of the same SSL, in
two-stage TTS on both read and spontaneous corpora, while maintaining constant
TTS model architecture and training settings. Results from listening tests show
that the 9th layer of 12-layer wav2vec2.0 (ASR finetuned) outperforms other
tested SSLs and mel-spectrogram, in both read and spontaneous TTS. Our work
sheds light on both how speech SSL can readily improve current TTS systems, and
how SSLs compare in the challenging generative task of TTS. Audio examples can
be found at https://www.speech.kth.se/tts-demos/ssr_tts

					<dc:description>  In the intracluster, intragroup, and circumgalactic medium (ICM, IGrM, CGM),
turbulence plays a vital role in the self-regulated feedback and feeding cycle
of central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we continue our systematic
dissection of the turbulent &quot;weather&quot; in high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of feedback driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). In
non-barotropic and stratified atmospheres, baroclinicity is expected to
generate fresh turbulence via misaligned gradients of density and pressure -
such as in cyclonic storms on Earth. In this work, we dissect for the first
time baroclinicity and its components in the astrophysical halo weather. Over
the macro-scale galaxy cluster, baroclinicity tends to be dynamically
subdominant for the enstrophy amplification. However, at and below the meso
scale near the SMBH (r&lt;10 kpc; t&lt;20 Myr), baroclinicity is important to seed
the initial enstrophy during active periods of AGN jet feedback. We find that
baroclinicity shows stronger correlation with the density rather than pressure
gradients. Despite the density-pressure gradient misalignment being often below
45{\deg}, their amplitudes boosted by mechanical AGN feedback are sufficient to
enable key enstrophy/turbulence generation. Our study provides a novel step
forward in understanding astrophysical atmospheres toward a unified
BlackHoleWeather framework, akin to the complexity of Earth's weather.

					<dc:description>  We present a general-purpose active learning scheme for data in metric
spaces. The algorithm maintains a collection of neighborhoods of different
sizes and uses label queries to identify those that have a strong bias towards
one particular label; when two such neighborhoods intersect and have different
labels, the region of overlap is treated as a ``known unknown'' and is a target
of future active queries. We give label complexity bounds for this method that
do not rely on assumptions about the data and we instantiate them in several
cases of interest.

					<dc:description>  In this letter, an orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) based
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is investigated for the
coordinated direct and relay transmission system, where a source directly
communicates with a near user with high mobile speed, and it needs the relaying
assistance to serve the far user also having high mobility. Due to the
coexistence of signal superposition coding and multi-domain transformation, the
performance of OTFS-based NOMA is usually challenging to be measured from a
theoretical perspective. To accurately evaluate the system performance of the
proposed scheme, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage
probability and the outage sum rate by using the Inversion formula and
characteristic function. Numerical results verify the performance superiority
and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

					<dc:description>  Join queries involving many relations pose a severe challenge to today's
query optimisation techniques. To some extent, this is due to the fact that
these techniques do not pay sufficient attention to structural properties of
the query. In stark contrast, the Database Theory community has intensively
studied structural properties of queries (such as acyclicity and various
notions of width) and proposed efficient query evaluation techniques through
variants of Yannakakis' algorithm. However, although most queries in practice
actually are acyclic or have low width, structure-guided query evaluation
techniques based on Yannakakis' algorithm have not found their way into
mainstream database technology yet. The goal of this work is to address this
gap between theory and practice and to demonstrate that the consideration of
query structure can improve query evaluation performance on modern DBMSs
significantly in cases that have been traditionally challenging. In particular,
we study the performance of structure-guided query evaluation in three
architecturally distinct DBMSs by rewriting SQL queries into a sequence of SQL
statements that express an execution of Yannakakis' algorithm. Moreover, we
identify a class of queries that is particularly well suited for our approach
and allows query answering in a variety of common scenarios without
materializing any join. Through empirical evaluation we show that
structure-guided query evaluation can make the evaluation of many difficult
join queries feasible whereas their evaluation requires a prohibitive amount of
time and memory on current DBMSs.

					<dc:description>  The extremum graph is a succinct representation of the Morse decomposition of
a scalar field. It has increasingly become a useful data structure that
supports topological feature directed visualization of 2D / 3D scalar fields,
and enables dimensionality reduction together with exploratory analysis of high
dimensional scalar fields. Current methods that employ the extremum graph
compute it either using a simple sequential algorithm for computing the Morse
decomposition or by computing the more detailed Morse-Smale complex. Both
approaches are typically limited to two and three dimensional scalar fields. We
describe a GPU-CPU hybrid parallel algorithm for computing the extremum graph
of scalar fields in all dimensions. The proposed shared memory algorithm
utilizes both fine grained parallelism and task parallelism to achieve
efficiency. An open source software library, TACHYON, that implements the
algorithm exhibits superior performance and good scaling behavior.

					<dc:description>  Federated learning (FL) has become a popular tool for solving traditional
Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. The multi-agent structure addresses the
major concern of data-hungry in traditional RL, while the federated mechanism
protects the data privacy of individual agents. However, the federated
mechanism also exposes the system to poisoning by malicious agents that can
mislead the trained policy. Despite the advantage brought by FL, the
vulnerability of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has not been
well-studied before. In this work, we propose the first general framework to
characterize FRL poisoning as an optimization problem constrained by a limited
budget and design a poisoning protocol that can be applied to policy-based FRL
and extended to FRL with actor-critic as a local RL algorithm by training a
pair of private and public critics. We also discuss a conventional defense
strategy inherited from FL to mitigate this risk. We verify our poisoning
effectiveness by conducting extensive experiments targeting mainstream RL
algorithms and over various RL OpenAI Gym environments covering a wide range of
difficulty levels. Our results show that our proposed defense protocol is
successful in most cases but is not robust under complicated environments. Our
work provides new insights into the vulnerability of FL in RL training and
poses additional challenges for designing robust FRL algorithms.

					<dc:description>  We study the dynamics of a cosmic string loop captured by a rotating black
hole, ignoring string reconnections. A loop is numerically evolved in Kerr
spacetime, with the result that it turns into one or more growing or
contracting double-lines rotating around the black hole in the equatorial
plane. This is in good agreement with the approximate analytical treatment of
the problem investigated by Xing et al., who studied the evolution of the
auxiliary curve associated with the string loop. We confirm that the auxiliary
curve deformation can indeed describe the string motion in realistic physical
scenarios to a reasonable accuracy, and can thus be used to further study other
phenomena such as superradiance and reconnections of the captured loop.

					<dc:description>  The study of topologically ordered states have given rise to a growing
interest in symmetry protected states in quantum matter. Recently, this theory
has been extended to quantum many body systems which demonstrate ordered states
at low temperature. An example of this is the discrete time crystal (DTC) which
has been demonstrated in a real quantum computer and in driven systems. These
states are periodic in time and are protected to disorder to a certain extent.
In general, DTC can be classified into two phases, the stable many body
localization (MBL) state, and the disordered thermal state. This work
demonstrates by generalizing DTC to 2 dimensions, there is an decrease in
thermal noise and an increase in the operating range of the MBL range in the
presence of disorder.

					<dc:description>  The quest for a quantum gravity phenomenology has inspired a quantum notion
of space-time, which motivates us to study the fate of the relativistic
symmetries of a particular model of quantum space-time, as well as its intimate
connection with the plausible emergent curved &quot;physical momentum space&quot;. We
here focus on the problem of Poincare symmetry of $\kappa$-Minkowski type
non-commutative (quantum) space-time, where the Poincare algebra, on its own,
remains undeformed, but in order to retain the structure of the space-time
non-commutative (NC) algebra, action of the algebra generators on the
operator-valued space-time manifold must be enveloping algebra valued that
lives in entire phase space i.e. the cotangent bundle on the space-time
manifold (at classical level). Further, we constructed a model for a spin-less
relativistic massive particle enjoying the deformed Poincare symmetry, using
the first order form of geometric Lagrangian, that satisfies a new deformed
dispersion relation and explored a feasible regime of a future Quantum Gravity
theory in which the momentum space becomes curved. In this scenario there is
only a mass scale (Planck mass $m_{p}$), but no length scale. Finally, we
relate the deformed mass shell to the geodesic distance in this curved momentum
space, where the mass of the particle gets renormalized as a result of
noncommutativity. We show, that under some circumstances, the Planck mass
provides an upper bound for the observed renormalized mass.

chiral model. Four intermediate channels are considered: the contact channel
and the channels with the intermediate axial vector, vector and pseudoscalar
mesons. The additional resonance states $K^* \pi$ and $K \rho$ are taken into
account in all channels. It is shown that the main contributions to the widths
of these decays are given by the axial vector channel. In the axial vector

					<dc:description>  This paper explores the impact of virtual guidance on mid-level
representation-based navigation, where an agent performs navigation tasks based
solely on visual observations. Instead of providing distance measures or
numerical directions to guide the agent, which may be difficult for it to
interpret visually, the paper investigates the potential of different forms of
virtual guidance schemes on navigation performance. Three schemes of virtual
guidance signals are explored: virtual navigation path, virtual waypoints, and
a combination of both. The experiments were conducted using a virtual city
built with the Unity engine to train the agents while avoiding obstacles. The
results show that virtual guidance provides the agent with more meaningful
navigation information and achieves better performance in terms of path
completion rates and navigation efficiency. In addition, a set of analyses were
provided to investigate the failure cases and the navigated trajectories, and a
pilot study was conducted for the real-world scenarios.

					<dc:description>  Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most popular tools for assessing and
selecting predictive models. However, standard CV suffers from high
computational cost when the number of folds is large. Recently, under the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, a line of works proposed efficient
methods to approximate CV based on the solution of the ERM problem trained on
the full dataset. However, in large-scale problems, it can be hard to obtain
the exact solution of the ERM problem, either due to limited computational
resources or due to early stopping as a way of preventing overfitting. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM
problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until
convergence. Our new method extends existing guarantees for CV approximation to
hold along the whole trajectory of the algorithm, including at convergence,
thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods. Finally, we illustrate the
accuracy and computational efficiency of our method through a range of
empirical studies.

					<dc:description>  Reparameterization aims to improve the generalization of deep neural networks
by transforming convolutional layers into equivalent multi-branched structures
during training. However, there exists a gap in understanding how
reparameterization may change and benefit the learning process of neural
networks. In this paper, we present a novel spatial gradient scaling method to
redistribute learning focus among weights in convolutional networks. We prove
that spatial gradient scaling achieves the same learning dynamics as a branched
reparameterization yet without introducing structural changes into the network.
We further propose an analytical approach that dynamically learns scalings for
each convolutional layer based on the spatial characteristics of its input
feature map gauged by mutual information. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that without searching for reparameterized structures, our
proposed scaling method outperforms the state-of-the-art reparameterization
strategies at a lower computational cost.

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE) is a milestone of modern day
physics, its disovery paved the way for the study of fractional charges which
do not obey abelian physics. However, all FQHE require an external magnetic
field in order for there to be fractionally charged electrons. This work shows
a theoretical study of strongly interaction electrons in the Kagome lattice
with magnetism. Under optimal conditions, a band gap opens on the surface of
the material which hosts fractional Fermions. These fractional Fermions form
composite quasi-electrons without the need for external magnetic field. These
states are predicted to host the FQHE without the need for an external magnetic
field.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a method for optimizing object detection models by
combining weight pruning and singular value decomposition (SVD). The proposed
method was evaluated on a custom dataset of street work images obtained from
https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100/street-work. The dataset consists of
611 training images, 175 validation images, and 87 test images with 7 classes.
We compared the performance of the optimized models with the original
unoptimized model in terms of frame rate, mean average precision (mAP@50), and
weight size. The results show that the weight pruning + SVD model achieved a
0.724 mAP@50 with a frame rate of 1.48 FPS and a weight size of 12.1 MB,
outperforming the original model (0.717 mAP@50, 1.50 FPS, and 12.3 MB).
Precision-recall curves were also plotted for all models. Our work demonstrates
that the proposed method can effectively optimize object detection models while
balancing accuracy, speed, and model size.

					<dc:description>  A detailed investigation of Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$ was performed in its
low-temperature magnetoelectric state combining neutron diffraction with
magnetization measurements on single crystals. In the paramagnetic state at 10
K, polarized neutron diffraction was applied to reveal the components of the
susceptibility tensor. The crystal and magnetic structures below the
antiferromagnetic transition temperature of $T_N \approx 4$ K were determined
using unpolarized neutron diffraction. This data implies no structural phase
transition from 10 K down to 2.5 K and is well described within the tetragonal
space group $P\bar{4}2_1m$. We found that in zero magnetic field the magnetic
space group is either $C_cmc2_1$ or $P_c2_12_12_1$ with antiferromagnetic order
along the [110] or [100] directions, respectively, while neighboring spins
along the [001] axis are ordered antiferromagnetically. A non-collinear spin
arrangement due to small canting within the $ab$ plane is allowed by symmetry
and observed experimentally. The ordered moment is found to be 3.24(3)
$\mu_B$/Mn$^{2+}$ at 2.5 K and the temperature-field dependent magnetic phase
diagram is mapped out by macroscopic magnetization. Distinct differences
between the magnetic structure of Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$ as compared to those of
Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ and Ca$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ are discussed.

an inpainting model for semantic data based on generative multinomial
diffusion. To maintain semantic consistency, we need to condition the
prediction for the missing regions on the known regions. We propose a novel and
efficient condition strategy, Look-Back Condition (LB-Con), which performs
one-step look-back operations during the reverse diffusion process. By doing
so, we are able to strengthen the harmonization between unknown and known
parts, leading to better completion performance. We have conducted extensive
experiments on different datasets, showing our proposed model outperforms
commonly used interpolation methods in various robotic applications.

					<dc:description>  We revisit the problem of learning in two-player zero-sum Markov games,
focusing on developing an algorithm that is $uncoupled$, $convergent$, and
$rational$, with non-asymptotic convergence rates. We start from the case of
stateless matrix game with bandit feedback as a warm-up, showing an
$\mathcal{O}(t^{-\frac{1}{8}})$ last-iterate convergence rate. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first result that obtains finite last-iterate
convergence rate given access to only bandit feedback. We extend our result to
the case of irreducible Markov games, providing a last-iterate convergence rate
of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-\frac{1}{9+\varepsilon}})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
Finally, we study Markov games without any assumptions on the dynamics, and
show a $path convergence$ rate, which is a new notion of convergence we
defined, of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-\frac{1}{10}})$. Our algorithm removes the
synchronization and prior knowledge requirement of [Wei et al., 2021], which
pursued the same goals as us for irreducible Markov games. Our algorithm is
related to [Chen et al., 2021, Cen et al., 2021] and also builds on the entropy
regularization technique. However, we remove their requirement of
communications on the entropy values, making our algorithm entirely uncoupled.

					<dc:description>  Let $G$ be a graph with a vertex set $V$. The graph $G$ is path-proximinal if
there are a semimetric $d \colon V \times V \to [0, \infty[$ and disjoint
proximinal subsets of the semimetric space $(V, d)$ such that $V = A \cup B$,
and vertices $u$, $v \in V$ are adjacent iff \[ d(u, v) \leqslant \inf \{d(x,
y) \colon x \in A, y \in B\}, \] and, for every $p \in V$, there is a path
connecting $A$ and $B$ in $G$, and passing through $p$. It is shown that a
graph is path-proximinal if and only if all its vertices are not isolated. It
is also shown that a graph is simultaneously proximinal and path-proximinal for
an ultrametric if and only if the degree of every its vertex is equal to $1$.

					<dc:description>  Mixup-based data augmentation has been validated to be a critical stage in
the self-training framework for unsupervised domain adaptive semantic
segmentation (UDA-SS), which aims to transfer knowledge from a well-annotated
(source) domain to an unlabeled (target) domain. Existing self-training methods
usually adopt the popular region-based mixup techniques with a random sampling
strategy, which unfortunately ignores the dynamic evolution of different
semantics across various domains as training proceeds. To improve the UDA-SS
performance, we propose an Informed Domain Adaptation (IDA) model, a
self-training framework that mixes the data based on class-level segmentation
performance, which aims to emphasize small-region semantics during mixup. In
our IDA model, the class-level performance is tracked by an expected confidence
score (ECS). We then use a dynamic schedule to determine the mixing ratio for
data in different domains. Extensive experimental results reveal that our
proposed method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art UDA-SS method by a
margin of 1.1 mIoU in the adaptation of GTA-V to Cityscapes and of 0.9 mIoU in
the adaptation of SYNTHIA to Cityscapes.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the number of holes created by an ``earthworm'' moving on the
two-dimensional integer lattice. The earthworm is modeled by a simple random
walk. At the initial time, all vertices are filled with grains of soil except
for the position of the earthworm. At each step, the earthworm pushes the soil
in the direction of its motion. It leaves a hole (an empty vertex with no grain
of soil) behind it. If there are holes in front of the earthworm (in the
direction of its step), the closest hole is filled with a grain of soil. Thus
the number of holes increases by 1 or remains unchanged at every step. We show
that the number of holes is at least $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/4})$ after $n$ steps.

					<dc:description>  This paper addresses the pointing acquisition phase of the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission as a guidance problem. It is
formulated in a cooperative game setup, which solution is a sequence of
corrections that can be used as a tracking reference to align all the
spacecraft' laser beams simultaneously within the tolerances required for
gravitational wave detection. We propose a model-free learning algorithm based
on residual-feedback and momentum, for accelerated convergence to stable
solutions, i.e. Nash Equilibria. Each spacecraft has 4 degrees of freedom, and
the only measured output considered are laser misalignments with the local
interferometer sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
strategy manages to achieve absolute misalignment errors $&lt;1\mu$rad in a timely
manner.

					<dc:creator>El-Ouahi, Jamal</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This study explores how scientometric data and indicators are used to
transform science systems in a selection of countries in the Middle East and
North Africa region. I propose that scientometric-based rules inform such
transformation. First, the research shows how research managers adopt
scientometrics as 'global standards'. I also show how several scientometric
data and indicators are adopted following a 'glocalization' process. Finally, I
demonstrate how research managers use this data to inform decision-making and
policymaking processes. This study contributes to a broader understanding of
the usage of scientometric indicators in the context of assessing research
institutions and researchers based on their publishing activities. Related to
these assessments, I also discuss how such data transforms and adapts local
science systems to meet so-called 'global standards'.

					<dc:description>  We detect a high level of polarization in the X-ray emission of the
black-hole binary 4U 1630-47 in an observation with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer. The $2-8$ keV polarization degree is 8 % at a position
angle of $18^\circ$, with the polarization degree increasing significantly with
energy, from $\sim 6$ % at $\sim 2$ keV to $\sim 11$ % at $\sim 8$ keV. The
continuum emission in the spectrum of simultaneous observations with the
Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, NICER, is well described with only
a thermal disc spectrum, with stringent upper limits to any Comptonized
emission from the corona. Together with the lack of significant variability in
the Fourier power spectrum, this suggests that the source was in the high-soft
state at the time of these observations. The NICER spectrum reveals the
presence of several absorption lines in the $6-9$ keV band that we fit with two
ionized absorbers, providing evidence of the presence of a strong disk wind,
which supports the idea that the source was in the soft state. Previous
measurements of X-ray polarization in other sources in harder states were
associated with the corona or the jet in those systems. Given that the corona
is significantly absent in this observation of 4U 1630-47, and that the jet in
black-hole binaries is quenched in the high-soft state, we speculate that in
this observation of 4U 1630-47, the polarization arises from the accretion-disk
wind in this source.

					<dc:description>  Recently, there were introduced important classes of relatively smooth,
relatively continuous, and relatively strongly convex optimization problems.
These concepts have significantly expanded the class of problems for which
optimal complexity estimates of gradient-type methods in high-dimensional
spaces take place. Basing on some recent works devoted to online optimization
(regret minimization) problems with both relatively Lipschitz continuous and
relatively strongly convex objective function, we introduce algorithms for
solving the strongly convex optimization problem with inequality constraints in
the online setting. We propose a scheme with switching between productive and
nonproductive steps for such types of problems and prove its convergence rate
for the class of relatively Lipschitz and strongly convex minimization
problems. We also provide an experimental comparison between the proposed
method and AdaMirr, recently proposed for relatively Lipschitz convex problems.

i.e. disorder larger than the observed finite-size crossover. Comparing
dynamics of this system to identical systems with uniformly large disorder, we
find evidence for exponentially slow thermalization (in disorder) within the
MBL regime when the rare region is present. We observe a decay of the spin
imbalance in the bulk of the large disorder region that persists to long times
($\sim10^{4}$) and find a universal behavior of the spectral function.

					<dc:title>Revisiting the Noise Model of Stochastic Gradient Descent</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Battash, Barak</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Lindenbaum, Ofir</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The stochastic gradient noise (SGN) is a significant factor in the success of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Following the central limit theorem, SGN was
initially modeled as Gaussian, and lately, it has been suggested that
stochastic gradient noise is better characterized using $S\alpha S$ L\'evy
distribution. This claim was allegedly refuted and rebounded to the previously
suggested Gaussian noise model. This paper presents solid, detailed empirical
evidence that SGN is heavy-tailed and better depicted by the $S\alpha S$
distribution. Furthermore, we argue that different parameters in a deep neural
network (DNN) hold distinct SGN characteristics throughout training. To more
accurately approximate the dynamics of SGD near a local minimum, we construct a
novel framework in $\mathbb{R}^N$, based on L\'evy-driven stochastic
differential equation (SDE), where one-dimensional L\'evy processes model each
parameter in the DNN. Next, we show that SGN jump intensity (frequency and
amplitude) depends on the learning rate decay mechanism (LRdecay); furthermore,
we demonstrate empirically that the LRdecay effect may stem from the reduction
of the SGN and not the decrease in the step size. Based on our analysis, we
examine the mean escape time, trapping probability, and more properties of DNNs
near local minima. Finally, we prove that the training process will likely exit
from the basin in the direction of parameters with heavier tail SGN. We will
share our code for reproducibility.

					<dc:creator>Lee, Yi-Lin</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We introduce a new symmetry class of domino tilings of the Aztec diamond,
called the off-diagonal symmetry class, which is motivated by the
off-diagonally symmetric alternating sign matrices introduced by Kuperberg in
2002. We use the method of non-intersecting lattice paths and a modification of
Stembridge's Pfaffian formula for families of non-intersecting lattice paths to
enumerate our new symmetry class. The number of off-diagonally symmetric domino
tilings of the Aztec diamond can be expressed as a Pfaffian of a matrix whose
entries satisfy a nice and simple recurrence relation.

					<dc:description>  Finding an optimum strategy to reach a certain destination by swimming in a
background flow is an interesting question which leads to non-trivial results
and swimming paths. Here we consider different strategies for various types of
surface currents, including parallel currents, and currents resulting from
spring sources, and sinks. Swimmers may instinctively swim toward the
destination point. It turns out that this idea may not lead to the desired
result in the presence of the background current. We will show in some cases
the best strategy is to swim towards a certain point other than the actual
destination. A different strategy may be to obtain the path of the least time
and then follow the minimized path. We study this alternative strategy, too.

					<dc:description>  Quantum complexity has shed light on CFT states dual to bulk geometries
containing spacelike singularities \cite{Barbon:2015ria, Bolognesi:2018ion,
Caputa:2021pad}. In this work, we turn our attention to the quantum complexity
of CFT/quantum gravity states which represent bulk geometries containing a
naked timelike singularity. The appearance of naked timelike singularities in
semiclassical limit is allowed in string theory, particularly in the context of
holography, so long as they satisfy the \emph{Gubser criterion}
\cite{Gubser:2000nd, Gursoy:2008za} - naked timelike singularities which arise
in the extremal limits of geometries containing cloaked singularities are
admissible. In this work, we formulate a criterion for the appearance of naked
timelike singularities based on holographic complexity. We study three cases of
naked timelike singularities, namely the negative mass Schwarzschild-AdS
spacetime, the timelike Kasner-AdS \cite{Ren:2016xhb} and Einstein-dilaton
system \cite{Ren:2019lgw}. The first two cases are ruled out by the Gubser
criterion while the third case is more subtle - as per Gubser criterion the
singularity switches from forbidden to admissible as the parameter $\alpha$ is
dialed in the range $[0,1]$ across the transition point $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{3}$.
We probe all three geometries using two holographic complexity prescriptions,
namely CA and CV. We propose a simple criterion that if the holographic
complexity of a geometry with naked timelike singularities is less than that of
empty AdS, then that singularity cannot arise in the semiclassical limit of a
UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. Our study strongly suggests that action
complexity (CA) is a sensitive tool to investigate timelike singularities,
being in sync with Gubser criterion in all cases. On the other hand volume
complexity (CV) turns out to be not a reliable tool to probe timelike
singularities.

					<dc:description>  Most of the standard image and video codecs are block-based and depending
upon the compression ratio the compressed images/videos suffer from different
distortions. At low ratios, blurriness is observed and as compression increases
blocking artifacts occur. Generally, in order to reduce blockiness, images are
low-pass filtered which leads to more blurriness. Also, in bokeh mode images
they are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of intentional blurred
background while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to
compression. Therefore, such visual media suffer from both blockiness and
blurriness distortions. Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered
distortion. Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these
distortions individually. This paper proposes a methodology to blindly measure
overall quality of an image suffering from these distortions, individually as
well as jointly. This is achieved by considering the sum of absolute values of
low and high-frequency Discrete Frequency Transform (DFT) coefficients defined
as sum magnitudes. The number of blocks lying in specific ranges of sum
magnitudes including zero-valued AC coefficients and mean of 100 maximum and
100 minimum values of these sum magnitudes are used as feature vectors. These
features are then fed to the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) model, which quantifies the image quality. The simulation
results show that the proposed method can estimate the quality of images
distorted with the blockiness, blurriness, noise and their combinations. It is
relatively fast compared to many state-of-art methods, and therefore is
suitable for real-time quality monitoring applications.

					<dc:description>  Here we propose the use of the organic semiconductor polyaniline (PANI) for
the preparation of spherical-shaped microparticles to serve as handles in
optical tweezers (OT) experiments. The stable trapping and manipulation of PANI
beads was demonstrated for the first time, using a Gaussian ($TEM_{00}$) beam
optical tweezers. The trap stiffness was characterized for various different
parameters such as the bead radius, the laser power and the distance between
the bead and the coverslip of the sample chamber, attesting the viability of
using such material for optical manipulation. Since the effective optical
properties of PANI can be modulated by the synthesis process, new related
applications are also proposed. The results of the present work therefore open
the door for using semiconductor polymeric materials in OT applications.

					<dc:description>  In this article a perturbative solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation
in the $D$-dimensional space $R^D$ with a general external potential is
studied. The solution describes the condensate wave-function of a gas
containing $N$ Bose particles. A criteria for the validity of the perturbative
solution is developed. Furthermore expressions for the particle density, the
chemical potential, the internal energy and the mean-square radius of the
condensate are derived corrected to first order in the coupling constant. The
scheme is then applied to obtain the solution of the GP equation in $D=1,2,3$
for external harmonic potentials. It is shown, in each case, that if $N$
exceeds a certain value the solution breaks down.

					<dc:description>  Traveling phenomena are prevalent in a variety of fields, from atmospheric
science to seismography and oceanography. However, there are two main
shortcomings in the current literature: the lack of realistic modeling tools
and the prohibitive computational costs for grid resolutions useful for data
applications. We propose a flexible simulation method for traveling phenomena.
To our knowledge, ours is the first method that is able to simulate extensions
of the classical frozen field, which only involves one deterministic velocity,
to a combination of velocities with random components, either in translation,
rotation or both, as well as to velocity fields point-wise varying with space
and time. We study extensions of the frozen field by relaxing constraints on
its spectrum as well, giving rise to still stationary but more realistic
traveling phenomena. Moreover, our proposed method is characterized by a lower
computational complexity than the one required for circulant embedding, one of
the most commonly employed simulation methods for Gaussian random fields, in
$\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$.

$G$ is the smallest natural number $k$ such that the edges of $G$ can be
assigned nonempty subsets of $[k]$ so that the union of the subsets assigned to
the edges incident to each vertex is different. We prove that $\chi'_\cup(G)

independently by Chartrand, Hallas and Zhang.

					<dc:description>  Intimacy is an essential element of human relationships and language is a
crucial means of conveying it. Textual intimacy analysis can reveal social
norms in different contexts and serve as a benchmark for testing computational
models' ability to understand social information. In this paper, we propose a
novel weak-labeling strategy for data augmentation in text regression tasks
called WADER. WADER uses data augmentation to address the problems of data
imbalance and data scarcity and provides a method for data augmentation in
cross-lingual, zero-shot tasks. We benchmark the performance of
State-of-the-Art pre-trained multilingual language models using WADER and
analyze the use of sampling techniques to mitigate bias in data and optimally
select augmentation candidates. Our results show that WADER outperforms the
baseline model and provides a direction for mitigating data imbalance and
scarcity in text regression tasks.

					<dc:description>  The Mat\'ern model has been a cornerstone of spatial statistics for more than
half a century. More recently, the Mat\'ern model has been central to
disciplines as diverse as numerical analysis, approximation theory,
computational statistics, machine learning, and probability theory. In this
article we take a Mat\'ern-based journey across these disciplines. First, we
reflect on the importance of the Mat\'ern model for estimation and prediction
in spatial statistics, establishing also connections to other disciplines in
which the Mat\'ern model has been influential. Then, we position the Mat\'ern
model within the literature on big data and scalable computation: the SPDE
approach, the Vecchia likelihood approximation, and recent applications in
Bayesian computation are all discussed. Finally, we review recent devlopments,
including flexible alternatives to the Mat\'ern model, whose performance we
compare in terms of estimation, prediction, screening effect, computation, and
Sobolev regularity properties.

					<dc:description>  Humans have long been recorded in a variety of forms since antiquity. For
example, sculptures and paintings were the primary media for depicting human
beings before the invention of cameras. However, most current human-centric
computer vision tasks like human pose estimation and human image generation
focus exclusively on natural images in the real world. Artificial humans, such
as those in sculptures, paintings, and cartoons, are commonly neglected, making
existing models fail in these scenarios. As an abstraction of life, art
incorporates humans in both natural and artificial scenes. We take advantage of
it and introduce the Human-Art dataset to bridge related tasks in natural and
artificial scenarios. Specifically, Human-Art contains 50k high-quality images
with over 123k person instances from 5 natural and 15 artificial scenarios,
which are annotated with bounding boxes, keypoints, self-contact points, and
text information for humans represented in both 2D and 3D. It is, therefore,
comprehensive and versatile for various downstream tasks. We also provide a
rich set of baseline results and detailed analyses for related tasks, including
human detection, 2D and 3D human pose estimation, image generation, and motion
transfer. As a challenging dataset, we hope Human-Art can provide insights for
relevant research and open up new research questions.

					<dc:title>A Study of Augmentation Methods for Handwritten Stenography Recognition</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  One of the factors limiting the performance of handwritten text recognition
(HTR) for stenography is the small amount of annotated training data. To
alleviate the problem of data scarcity, modern HTR methods often employ data
augmentation. However, due to specifics of the stenographic script, such
settings may not be directly applicable for stenography recognition. In this
work, we study 22 classical augmentation techniques, most of which are commonly
used for HTR of other scripts, such as Latin handwriting. Through extensive
experiments, we identify a group of augmentations, including for example
contained ranges of random rotation, shifts and scaling, that are beneficial to
the use case of stenography recognition. Furthermore, a number of augmentation
approaches, leading to a decrease in recognition performance, are identified.
Our results are supported by statistical hypothesis testing. Links to the
publicly available dataset and codebase are provided.

					<dc:description>  Reverse engineering of FPGA designs from bitstreams to RTL models aids in
understanding the high level functionality of the design and for validating and
reconstructing legacy designs. Fast carry-chains are commonly used in synthesis
of operators in FPGA designs. We propose a method to detect word-level
structures by analyzing these carry-chains in LUT (Look-Up Table) level
netlists. We also present methods to adapt existing techniques to identify
combinational operations and sequential modules in ASIC netlists to LUT
netlists. All developed and adapted techniques are consolidated into an
integrated tool-chain to aid in reverse engineering of word-level designs from
LUT-level netlists. When evaluated on a set of real-world designs, the
tool-chain infers 34\% to 100\% of the elements in the netlist to be part of a
known word-level operation or a known sequential module.

					<dc:description>  A high-efficiency spin-photon interface is an essential piece of quantum
hardware necessary for various quantum technologies. Self-assembled InGaAs
quantum dots have excellent optical properties, if embedded into an optical
micro-cavity they can show near-deterministic spin-photon entanglement and spin
readout, but an external magnetic field is required to address the individual
spin states, which usually is done using a superconducting magnet. Here, we
show a compact cryogenically compatible SmCo magnet design that delivers 475 mT
in-plane Voigt geometry magnetic field at 5 K, which is suitable to lift the
energy degeneracy of the electron spin states and trion transitions of a single
InGaAs quantum dot. This quantum dot is embedded in a birefringent high-finesse
optical micro-cavity which enables efficient collection of single photons
emitted by the quantum dot. We demonstrate spin-state manipulation by
addressing the trion transitions with a single and two laser fields. The
experimental data agrees well to our model which covers single- and two-laser
cross-polarized resonance fluorescence, Purcell enhancement in a birefringent
cavity, and variation of the laser powers.

					<dc:description>  Chiral crystals show promise for spintronic technologies on account of their
efficient spin filtering. This has led to significant recent interest in
quantitative characterization and first-principles prediction of their
optoelectronic properties, elucidating connections between chiroptical and spin
transport properties in chiral materials. Here, we outline a computational
framework for efficient ab initio calculations of circular dichroism (CD) in
crystalline materials. We leverage direct calculation of orbital angular
momentum and quadrupole matrix element calculations in density-functional
theory (DFT) and Wannier interpolation to calculate CD in complex materials,
removing the need for band convergence and accelerating Brillouin-zone
convergence compared to prior approaches. We find strong agreement with
measured CD signals in molecules and crystals ranging in complexity from small
bulk unit cells to 2D hybrid perovskites, and show the importance of the
quadrupole contribution to the anisotropic CD in crystals. We leverage the
tensorial behavior of CD with respect to propagation direction to analyze the
strongly orientation-dependent CD of compex chiral crystals such as hybrid
perovskites. Spin-orbit coupling affects the CD of crystals with heavier atoms,
as expected, but this is primarily due to changes in the electronic energies,
rather than due to direct contributions from the spin matrix elements.

					<dc:description>  We develop a model for correlations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy
on the largest angular scales, based on standard causal geometrical
relationships in slow-roll inflation. Unlike standard models based on quantized
field modes, it describes perturbations with nonlocal directional coherence on
spherical boundaries of causal diamonds. Causal constraints reduce the number
of independent degrees of freedom, impose new angular symmetries, and eliminate
cosmic variance for purely angular 2-point correlations. Distortions of causal
structure from vacuum fluctuations are modeled as gravitational memory from
randomly oriented outgoing and incoming gravitational null shocks, with
nonlocally coherent directional displacements on curved surfaces of causal
diamonds formed by standard inflationary horizons. The angular distribution is
determined by axially symmetric shock displacements on circular intersections
of the comoving sphere that represents the CMB photosphere with other
inflationary horizons. Displacements on thin spheres at the end of inflation
have a unique angular power spectrum $C_\ell$ that approximates the standard
expectation on small angular scales, but differs substantially at large angular
scales due to horizon curvature. For a thin sphere, the model predicts a
universal angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ with an exact ``causal
shadow'' symmetry, $C(\pi/4&lt;\Theta&lt;3\pi/4)= 0$, and significant large-angle
parity violation. We apply a rank statistic to compare models with WMAP and
Planck satellite data, and find that a causally-coherent model with no shape
parameters or cosmic variance agrees with the measured $C(\Theta)$ better than
a large fraction ($&gt; 0.9999$) of standard model realizations. Model-independent
tests of holographic causal symmetries are proposed.

					<dc:title>Dissipative Capture of Planets Into First-Order Mean-Motion Resonances</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Batygin, Konstantin</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The emergence of orbital resonances among planets is a natural consequence of
the early dynamical evolution of planetary systems. While it is
well-established that convergent migration is necessary for mean-motion
commensurabilities to emerge, recent numerical experiments have shown that the
existing adiabatic theory of resonant capture provides an incomplete
description of the relevant physics, leading to an erroneous mass scaling in
the regime of strong dissipation. In this work, we develop a new model for
resonance capture that self-consistently accounts for migration and
circularization of planetary orbits, and derive an analytic criterion based
upon stability analysis that describes the conditions necessary for the
formation of mean-motion resonances. We subsequently test our results against
numerical simulations and find satisfactory agreement. Our results elucidate
the critical role played by adiabaticity and resonant stability in shaping the
orbital architectures of planetary systems during the nebular epoch, and
provide a valuable tool for understanding their primordial dynamical evolution.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we established a sharp version of the difference analogue of
the celebrated H\&quot;{o}lder's theorem concerning the differential independence of
the Euler gamma function $\Gamma$. More precisely, if $P$ is a polynomial of
$n+1$ variables in $\mathbb{C}[X, Y_0,\dots, Y_{n-1}]$ such that
\begin{equation*} P(s, \Gamma(s+a_0), \dots, \Gamma(s+a_{n-1}))\equiv 0
\end{equation*}
  for some $(a_0, \dots, a_{n-1})\in \mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $a_i-a_j\notin
\mathbb{Z}$ for any $0\leq i&lt;j\leq n-1$, then we have $$P\equiv 0.$$
  Our result complements a classical result of algebraic differential
independence of the Euler gamma function proved by H\&quot;{o}lder in 1886, and also
a result of algebraic difference independence of the Riemann zeta function
proved by Chiang and Feng in 2006.

maximally monotone and uniformly monotone. We give a quantitative study of
these notions in the style of proof mining, providing a modulus of super strong
nonexpansiveness, giving concrete examples of it and connecting it to moduli
associated to uniform monotonicity. For the supercoercive case, we analyze the
situation further, yielding a quantitative inconsistent feasibility result for
this class (obtaining effective uniform rates of asymptotic regularity), a
result which is also qualitatively new.

  from a Dihedral Flavor Symmetry</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Miskaoui, M.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Phenomenology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose a new neutrino flavor model based on $D_{4}\times U(1)$ family
symmetry providing predictions for neutrino masses and mixing along with a
possible origin of the observed Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). The
tiny neutrino masses are generated through type I seesaw mechanism while the
neutrino mixing is described through the trimaximal (TM$_{\mathrm{2}}$)
pattern. By performing a numerical analysis, we find that the model favors a
normal mass hierarchy with the lightest neutrino mass lies in the range
$m_{1}\in \lbrack 2.516,21.351]$ $m{eV}$. Additionally, the model predicts a
non-zero value of the reactor angle $\theta _{13}$ while the atmospheic angle
$\theta _{23}$ lies in the lower octant. We explore the phenomenological
implications of the neutrino sector in detail and discuss the results. On the
other hand, we address the BAU via leptogenesis from the decay of three right
handed neutrinos $N_{i}$. Through analytical and numerical analysis of the
baryon asymmetry parameter $Y_{B}$, a successful unflavored leptogenesis takes
place within the allowed parameter space obtained from neutrino phenomenology.
Moreover, interesting correlations between $Y_{B}$ and low-energy observables
are examined.

determine the exact distribution of the coverage of prediction sets for a

miscoverage level and the calibration sample size.

					<dc:description>  The Skorokhod reflection was used in 1961 to create a reflected diffusion on
the half-line. Later, it was used for processes with jumps such as reflected
L\'evy processes. Like a Brownian motion, which is a weak limit of random
walks, reflected processes on the half-line serve as weak limits of random
walks with switching regimes at zero: one regime away from zero, the other
around zero. In this article, we develop a general theory of this regime change
and prove convergence to a function with generalized reflection. Our results
are deterministic and can be applied to a wide class of stochastic processes.
Applications include storage processes, heavy traffic limits, diffusion on a
half-line with a combination of continuous reflection, jump exit, and a delay
at 0.

					<dc:description>  We study the astrochemical diagnostics of the isolated massive protostar
G28.20-0.05. We analyze data from ALMA 1.3~mm observations with resolution of
0.2 arcsec ($\sim$1,000 au). We detect emission from a wealth of species,
including oxygen-bearing (e.g., $\rm{H_2CO}$, $\rm{CH_3OH}$, $\rm{CH_3OCH_3}$),
sulfur-bearing (SO$_2$, H$_2$S) and nitrogen-bearing (e.g., HNCO, NH$_2$CHO,
C$_2$H$_3$CN, C$_2$H$_5$CN) molecules. We discuss their spatial distributions,
physical conditions, correlation between different species and possible
chemical origins. In the central region near the protostar, we identify three
hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a mm continuum ring-like structure,
is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of
$\sim300\:$K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side
of the ring, has a temperature of $\sim250\:$K, and is of intermediate chemical
complexity. HMC3 is further away, $\sim3,000\:$au in projection, cooler
($\sim70\:$K) and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass
surface densities ($\sim10\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$), number densities ($n_{\rm
H}\sim10^9\:{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$) and masses of a few $M_\odot$. The total gas mass
in the cores and in the region out to $3,000\:$au is $\sim 25\:M_\odot$, which
is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions
of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the
HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and
abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core
astrochemistry.

					<dc:description>  This synthetic control study quantifies the economic costs of the
Russo-Ukrainian war in terms of foregone entrepreneurial activity in both
countries since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Relative to its synthetic
counterfactual, Ukraine's number of self-employed dropped by 675,000,
corresponding to a relative loss of 20%. The number of Ukrainian SMEs
temporarily dropped by 71,000 (14%) and recovered within five years of the
conflict. In contrast, Russia had lost more than 1.4 million SMEs (42%) five
years into the conflict. The disappearance of Russian SMEs is driven by both
fewer new businesses created and more existing business closures.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new, rapidly convergent, the so-called Fourier over Spheroid
(FoS), shape parametrization to model fission of heavy nuclei. Four collective
coordinates are used to characterize the shape of the fissioning system, being
its elongation, left-right asymmetry, neck size, and non-axiality. The
potential energy landscape is computed within the macroscopic-microscopic
approach, on the top of which the multi-dimensional Langevin equation is solved
to describe the dynamics. Charge equilibration at scission and de-excitation of
the primary fragments after scission are further considered. The model gives
access to a wide variety of observables, including fission fragments mass,
charge, and kinetic energy yields, fragment mean N/Z and post-scission neutron
multiplicities, and importantly, their correlations. The latter are crucial to
unravel the complexity of the fission process. The parameters of the model were
tuned to reproduce experimental observation from thermal neutron-induced
fission of 235U, and next used to discuss the transition from the asymmetric to
symmetric fission along the Fm isotopic chain.

					<dc:description>  Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum
computing. Recent experimental results suggest that continuous-time analog
quantum simulation would be advantageous over gate-based digital quantum
simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Size Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However,
programming such analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the
lack of a unified interface between hardware and software, and the only few
known examples are all hardware-specific. In this paper, we design and
implement SimuQ, the first domain-specific language for Hamiltonian simulation
that supports pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum
simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users will specify the target
Hamiltonian evolution with a Hamiltonian modeling language, and the
programmability of analog simulators is specified through a new abstraction
called the abstract analog instruction set by hardware providers. Through a
solver-based compilation, SimuQ will generate the pulse-level instruction
schedule on the target analog simulator for the desired Hamiltonian evolution,
which has been demonstrated on pulse-controlled superconducting (Qiskit Pulse)
and neutral-atom (QuEra Bloqade) quantum systems, as well as on normal
circuit-based digital quantum machines. Moreover, we also demonstrate the
advantage of analog compilation over digital compilation on IBM machines, the
use of SimuQ for resource estimation for hypothetical machines, and a
scalability test of SimuQ's compilation.

					<dc:title>A Low-Cost Portable Apparatus to Analyze Oral Fluid Droplets and
  Quantify the Efficacy of Masks</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Bhowmik, Ava Tan</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Every year, about 4 million people die from upper respiratory infections.
Mask-wearing is crucial in preventing the spread of pathogen-containing
droplets, which is the primary cause of these illnesses. However, most
techniques for mask efficacy evaluation are expensive to set up and complex to
operate. In this work, a novel, low-cost, and quantitative metrology to
visualize, track, and analyze orally-generated fluid droplets is developed. The
project has four stages: setup optimization, data collection, data analysis,
and application development. The metrology was initially developed in a dark
closet as a proof of concept using common household materials and was
subsequently implemented into a portable apparatus. Tonic water and UV
darklight tube lights are selected to visualize fluorescent droplet and aerosol
propagation with automated analysis developed using open-source software. The
dependencies of oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on various
factors are studied in detail and established using this metrology.
Additionally, the smallest detectable droplet size was mathematically
correlated to height and airborne time. The efficacy of different types of
masks is evaluated and associated with fabric microstructures. It is found that
masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker material are more effective. This
technique can easily be constructed at home using materials that total to a
cost of below \$60, thereby enabling a low-cost and accurate metrology.

					<dc:description>  This work presents a contracting hierarchical observer that fuses position
and orientation measurements with an IMU to generate smooth position, linear
velocity, orientation, and IMU bias estimates that are guaranteed to converge
to their true values. The proposed approach is composed of two contracting
observers. The first is a quaternion-based orientation observer that also
estimates gyroscope bias. The output of the orientation observer serves as an
input for another contracting observer that estimates position, linear
velocity, and accelerometer bias thus forming a hierarchy. We show that the
proposed observer guarantees all state estimates converge to their true values.
Simulation results confirm the theoretical performance guarantees.

					<dc:description>  The conditional gradient idea proposed by Marguerite Frank and Philip Wolfe
in 1956 was so well received by the community that new algorithms (also called
Frank--Wolfe type algorithms) are still being actively created. In this paper,
we study a non-smooth stochastic convex optimization problem with constraints.
Using a smoothing technique and based on an accelerated batched first-order
Stochastic Conditional Gradient Sliding method, we propose a novel
gradient-free Frank--Wolfe type algorithm called Zero-Order Stochastic
Conditional Gradient Sliding (ZO-SCGS). This algorithm is robust not only for
the class of non-smooth problems, but surprisingly also for the class of smooth
black box problems, outperforming the SOTA algorithms in the smooth case in
term oracle calls. In practical experiments we confirm our theoretical results.

					<dc:title>Rank and Condition Number Analysis for UAV MIMO Channels Using Ray

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Channel rank and condition number of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels
can be effective indicators of achievable rates with spatial multiplexing in
mobile networks. In this paper, we use extensive ray tracing simulations to
investigate channel rank, condition number, and signal coverage distribution
for air-to-ground MIMO channels. We consider UAV-based user equipment (UE) at
altitudes of 3 m, 30 m, 70 m, and 110 m from the ground. Moreover, we also
consider their communication link with a cellular base station in urban and
rural areas. In particular, Centennial Campus and Lake Wheeler Road Field Labs
of NC State University are considered, and their geographical information
extracted from the open street map (OSM) database is incorporated into ray
tracing simulations. Our results characterize how the channel rank tends to
reduce as a function of UAV altitude, while also providing insights into the
effects of geography, building distribution, and threshold parameters on
channel rank and condition number.

					<dc:description>  The computation of the topology of a real algebraic plane curve is greatly
simplified if there are no more than one critical point in each vertical line:
the general position condition. When this condition is not satisfied, then a
finite number of changes of coordinates will move the initial curve to one in
general position. We will show many cases where the topology of the considered
curve around a critical point is very easy to compute even if the curve is not
in general position. This will be achieved by introducing a new family of
formulae describing, in many cases and through subresultants, the multiple
roots of a univariate polynomial as rational functions of the considered
polynomial involving at most one square root.
  This new approach will be used to show that the topology of cubics, quartics
and quintics can be computed easily even if the curve is not in general
position and to characterise those higher degree curves where this approach can
be used. We will apply also this technique to determine the intersection curve
of two quadrics and to study how to characterise the type of the curve arising
when intersecting two ellipsoids.

					<dc:title>Robustness, Evaluation and Adaptation of Machine Learning Models in the

					<dc:creator>Piratla, Vihari</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Our goal is to improve reliability of Machine Learning (ML) systems deployed
in the wild. ML models perform exceedingly well when test examples are similar
to train examples. However, real-world applications are required to perform on
any distribution of test examples. Current ML systems can fail silently on test
examples with distribution shifts. In order to improve reliability of ML models
due to covariate or domain shift, we propose algorithms that enable models to:
(a) generalize to a larger family of test distributions, (b) evaluate accuracy
under distribution shifts, (c) adapt to a target distribution. We study causes
of impaired robustness to domain shifts and present algorithms for training
domain robust models. A key source of model brittleness is due to domain
overfitting, which our new training algorithms suppress and instead encourage
domain-general hypotheses. While we improve robustness over standard training
methods for certain problem settings, performance of ML systems can still vary
drastically with domain shifts. It is crucial for developers and stakeholders
to understand model vulnerabilities and operational ranges of input, which
could be assessed on the fly during the deployment, albeit at a great cost.
Instead, we advocate for proactively estimating accuracy surfaces over any
combination of prespecified and interpretable domain shifts for performance
forecasting. We present a label-efficient estimation to address estimation over
a combinatorial space of domain shifts. Further, when a model's performance on
a target domain is found to be poor, traditional approaches adapt the model
using the target domain's resources. Standard adaptation methods assume access
to sufficient labeled resources, which may be impractical for deployed models.
We initiate a study of lightweight adaptation techniques with only unlabeled
data resources with a focus on language applications.

					<dc:description>  Quantum many-body systems are typically endowed with a tensor product
structure. This structure is inherited from probability theory, where the
probability of two independent events is the product of the probabilities. The
tensor product structure of a Hamiltonian thus gives a natural decomposition of
the system into independent smaller subsystems. Considering a particular
Hamiltonian and a particular tensor product structure, one can ask: is there a
basis in which this Hamiltonian has this desired tensor product structure? In
particular, we ask: is there a basis in which an arbitrary Hamiltonian has a
2-local form, i.e. it contains only pairwise interactions? Here we show, using
numerical and analytical arguments, that generic Hamiltonian (e.g. a large
random matrix) can approximately be written as a linear combination of two-body
interactions terms with high precision; that is the Hamiltonian is 2-local in a
carefully chosen basis. We show that these Hamiltonians are robust to
perturbations. Taken together, our results suggest a possible mechanism for the
emergence of locality from chaos.

maximizes the value function against the worst possible stochastic model of the
environment in an uncertainty set. We focus on the tabular episodic learning
setting where the algorithm has access to a generative model of the nominal
(training) environment around which the uncertainty set is defined. We propose
the Robust Phased Value Learning (RPVL) algorithm to solve this problem for the
uncertainty sets specified by four different divergences: total variation,
chi-square, Kullback-Leibler, and Wasserstein. We show that our algorithm
achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}| H^{5})$ sample
complexity, which is uniformly better than the existing results by a factor of
$|\mathcal{S}|$, where $|\mathcal{S}|$ is number of states, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is
the number of actions, and $H$ is the horizon length. We also provide the
first-ever sample complexity result for the Wasserstein uncertainty set.
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using simulation
experiments.

					<dc:title>Censored Quantile Regression with Many Controls</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Hong, Seoyun</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - Econometrics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper develops estimation and inference methods for censored quantile
regression models with high-dimensional controls. The methods are based on the
application of double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework to the censored
quantile regression estimator of Buchinsky and Hahn (1998). I provide valid
inference for low-dimensional parameters of interest in the presence of
high-dimensional nuisance parameters when implementing machine learning
estimators. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically
normal. The performance of the estimator with high-dimensional controls is
illustrated with numerical simulation and an empirical application that
examines the effect of 401(k) eligibility on savings.

					<dc:description>  We report on zone center THz excitations of non-Jahn Teller LaFeO$_3$,
PrFeO$_3$, ErFeO$_3$, and LuFeO$_3$ distorted perovskites under external
magnetic fields up 7 T. Low temperature-low energy absorptions of LaFeO$_3$
show antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic magnons at $\omega$AFM ~31.4 and
$\omega$FM ~26.7 cm$^{-1}$ in the $\Gamma$4 (Gx, Ay, Fz) representation with
degeneracy near linearly lifted by the field. LuFeO$_3$ is characterized by
zero field magnetic resonances at $\omega$AFM ~26.3 cm$^{-1}$ and $\omega$FM
~22.4 cm$^{-1}$ in addition to Fe$^{3+}$ Zeeman-split crystal field (CF) 6A$_1$
ground transitions at ~10.4 cm$^{-1}$ triggered by subtle structural deviations
induced by the Lu 4f$^{14}$ smaller ionic radius. This local
quasi-non-centrosymmetric departure is also found in ErFeO$_3$ (Kramers
4f$^{11}$ Er$^{3+}$ (4I15/2); {\Gamma}2 (Fx, Cy, Gz) &lt;TSR ~93 K), but with the
~4 cm$^{-1}$ Fe$^{3+}$ Zeeman branching strongly biased toward higher energies
due to 3d-4f exchange. Magnons at $\omega$AFM ~31.5 cm$^{-1}$ and $\omega$FM
~21.5 cm$^{-1}$ in ErFeO$_3$ do not undergo field induced band splits but a
13-fold increase in the antiferro ($\omega$AMF) /ferro($\omega$AFM) intensity
ratio. There is a remarkable field-dependent CF matching population balance
between Fe$^{3+}$ higher and Er$^{3+}$ lower Zeeman branches. Antiferro- and
ferro- resonances in PrFeO$_3$ turn much broader as non-Kramers Pr$^3$
introduces ligand changes at the A site leading into near degeneracy the
antiferromagnetic mode and the lowest Pr$^{3+}$ CF transition. We conclude that
low energy excitations in RFeO$_3$ (R=rare earth) strongly depend on the
lanthanide ionic size. Minute lattice displacements also underlie considering
non-centrosymmetric the most distorted RFeO$_3$ (R=rare earth). Changes
triggered by the smaller rare earth and the nonlinear intrinsic oxygen ion
polarizability provide grounds for interplay of ionic and electronic
interactions yielding ferroelectric spontaneous polarization.

					<dc:title>Watching ion-driven folding kinetics of a ribozyme one molecule at a
  time</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Hori, Naoto</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Thirumalai, D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Biomolecules</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Soft Condensed Matter</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Folding of ribozymes into well-defined tertiary structures usually requires
divalent cations. How Mg$^{2+}$ ions direct the folding kinetics is a
long-standing unsolved problem because experiments cannot detect the positions
and dynamics of ions as the ribozyme assembles. To solve this problem, we used
molecular simulations to dissect the folding kinetics of the Azoarcus ribozyme
by monitoring the path each molecule takes to reach the folded state. We
establish quantitatively that Mg$^{2+}$ binding to specific sites, coupled with
counter-ion release of monovalent cations, stimulate the formation of secondary
and tertiary structures, leading to diverse pathways that include direct rapid
folding and trapping in a manifold of misfolded structures. Assembly of the
Azoarcus ribozyme begins only after Mg$^{2+}$ ions condense onto RNA,
displacing the monovalent cations in the process. In some molecules, key
tertiary structural elements form when Mg$^{2+}$ ions bind to specific RNA
sites, at the earliest stages of the folding, leading to specific collapse and
rapid formation of the folded structure. In others, the formation of non-native
base pairs, whose rearrangement is needed to reach the folded state, is the
rate-limiting step. Escape from energetic traps, driven by thermal
fluctuations, occurs readily. In contrast, the transition to the native state
from long-lived topologically trapped native-like metastable states is
extremely slow. Specific collapse and formation of energetically or
topologically frustrated states occur early in the assembly process.

					<dc:description>  We measure the polarization fraction of a sample of $6282$ Galactic cold
clumps at $353 \, \mathrm{GHz} $, consisting of $Planck$ Galactic cold clump
(PGCC) catalogue category 1 objects (flux densities measured with
signal-to-noise ratio $(\mathrm{S/N}) &gt; 4$). We find the mean-squared
polarization fraction at $353 \, \mathrm{GHz} $ to be $ \langle \Pi ^ 2 \rangle
= [ 4.79 \pm 0.44 ] \times 10 ^ {-4} $ equating to an $ 11 \, \sigma $
detection of polarization. We test if the polarization fraction depends on the
clumps' physical properties, including flux density, luminosity, Galactic
latitude and physical distance. We see a trend towards increasing polarization
fraction with increasing Galactic latitude, but find no evidence that
polarization depends on the other tested properties. The Simons Observatory,
with an angular resolution of order $1 \, \mathrm{arcmin } $ and noise levels
between $22$ and $54$ $ \mu \mathrm{ K-arcmin } $ at high frequencies, will
substantially enhance our ability to determine the magnetic field structure in
Galactic cold clumps. At $ 280 \, \mathrm{GHz} $ and $ \ge 5 \, \sigma $
significance, we predict the Simons Observatory will detect $6000$ cold clumps
in intensity and $200$ cold clumps in polarization. This number of polarized
detections would represent a two orders of magnitude increase over the current
$Planck$ results.

					<dc:title>Mapping classes fixing an isotropic homology class of minimal genus $0$
  in rational $4$-manifolds</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Lee, Seraphina Eun Bi</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Geometric Topology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  For any $N \geq 1$, let $M_N$ denote the rational $4$-manifold $\mathbb{CP}^2
\# N \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. In this paper we study the stabilizer
$\text{Stab}(w)$ of a primitive, isotropic class $w\in H_2(M_N; \mathbb Z)$ of
minimal genus $0$ under the natural action of the topological mapping class
group $\text{Mod}(M_N)$ on $H_2(M_N; \mathbb Z)$. Although most elements of
$\text{Stab}(w)$ cannot be represented by homeomorphisms that preserve any
Lefschetz fibration $M_N \to \Sigma$, we show that any element of
$\text{Stab}(w)$ can be represented by a diffeomorphism that almost preserves a
holomorphic, genus-$0$ Lefschetz fibration $\text{pr}: M_N \to \mathbb{CP}^1$
whose generic fibers represent the homology class $w$. We also answer the
Nielsen realization problem for a certain maximal torsion-free, abelian
subgroup $\Lambda_w$ of $\text{Mod}(M_N)$ by finding a lift of $\Lambda_w$ to
$\text{Diff}^+(M_N) \leq \text{Homeo}^+(M_N)$ under the quotient map $q:
\text{Homeo}^+(M_N)\to \text{Mod}(M_N)$ which can be made to almost preserve
$\text{pr}: M_N \to \mathbb{CP}^1$. All results of this paper also hold for
every primitive, isotropic class $w \in H_2(M_N; \mathbb Z)$ if $N \leq 8$
because any such class has minimal genus $0$.

					<dc:description>  The anomaly cancellation is a basic property of the Standard Model, crucial
for its consistence. We consider a lattice chiral gauge theory of massless
Wilson fermions interacting with a non-compact massive U(1) field coupled with
left and right handed fermions in four dimensions. We prove in the infinite
volume limit, for weak coupling and inverse lattice step of the order of boson
mass, that the anomaly vanishes up to subleading corrections and under the same
condition as in the continuum. The proof is based on a combination of exact
Renormalization Group, non perturbative decay bounds of correlations and
lattice symmetries.

					<dc:description>  Hadronic interaction models are a core ingredient of simulations of extensive

shower observables. Recently, Pythia~8, a hadronic interaction model popular in
accelerator-based high-energy physics, became usable in air shower simulations
as well. We have integrated Pythia~8 with its new capabilities into the air
shower simulation framework CORSIKA~8. First results show significantly
shallower shower development, which we attribute to higher cross-section
predictions by the new simplified nuclear model of Pythia.

					<dc:description>  Recent advancements in explainable machine learning provide effective and
faithful solutions for interpreting model behaviors. However, many explanation
methods encounter efficiency issues, which largely limit their deployments in
practical scenarios. Real-time explainer (RTX) frameworks have thus been
proposed to accelerate the model explanation process by learning a
one-feed-forward explainer. Existing RTX frameworks typically build the
explainer under the supervised learning paradigm, which requires large amounts
of explanation labels as the ground truth. Considering that accurate
explanation labels are usually hard to obtain due to constrained computational
resources and limited human efforts, effective explainer training is still
challenging in practice. In this work, we propose a COntrastive Real-Time
eXplanation (CoRTX) framework to learn the explanation-oriented representation
and relieve the intensive dependence of explainer training on explanation
labels. Specifically, we design a synthetic strategy to select positive and
negative instances for the learning of explanation. Theoretical analysis show
that our selection strategy can benefit the contrastive learning process on
explanation tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets further
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed CoRTX framework.

					<dc:description>  We present the Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) hypergeometric systems of
the Feynman integrals of the three-loop vacuum diagrams with arbitrary masses,
basing on Mellin-Barnes representations and Miller's transformation. The
codimension of derived GKZ hypergeometric systems equals the number of
independent dimensionless ratios among the virtual masses squared. Through GKZ
hypergeometric systems, the analytical hypergeometric series solutions can be
obtained in neighborhoods of origin including infinity. The linear independent
hypergeometric series solutions whose convergent regions have non-empty
intersection can constitute a fundamental solution system in a proper subset of
the whole parameter space. The analytical expression of the vacuum integral can
be formulated as a linear combination of the corresponding fundamental solution
system in certain convergent region.

					<dc:description>  We explore the maximality of the Hilbert square of maximal real surfaces, and
find that in many cases the Hilbert square is maximal if and only if the
surface has connected real locus. In particular, the Hilbert square of no
maximal K3-surface is maximal. Nevertheless, we exhibit maximal surfaces with
disconnected real locus whose Hilbert square is maximal.

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work, a classification task is realized by the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) approach. A decision situation concerns issuing commodities
in the process of credit sales -- at some point a client's history may be
analyzed by debt department's employee to check if the goods issuing should not
be stopped due to the risk of fraud (bivalent classification). As in the
classical machine learning, the data should be normalized. We describe the
two-step process of data normalization to write each observation as a quantum
state. The VQE approach allows training the parameters of a quantum circuit
(so-called ansatz) to output pattern-states for each class. Observations are
categorized to classes with the use of the SWAP-test. The obtained solution is
compact and requires only logarithmically increasing number of qubits (due to
the exponential capacity of quantum registers) -- we also present alternative
classical solutions which, in fact, are quite complex. All calculations, plots,
and comparisons were implemented and conduced in Python language environment.
Source codes of the simulations for individual examples of quantum
classification can be found in the source code repository. The version of a
simulator directly used in the article is in the Zenodo version of the source
code.

					<dc:description>  This paper investigates the impact of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath
signals on frequency-locked loops (FLLs), which are commonly used to obtain
Doppler shift measurements for velocity estimation in radio navigation. A
salient result is that, in the absence of a direct signal, a single NLOS signal
does not corrupt Doppler observables if the angle-of-arrival (AOA) is known.
Another striking result is that, in a multipath environment involving two
signals, the arctangent discriminator (averaged over the beat frequency) tracks
only the higher amplitude signal. Our investigation has particular significance
for radio navigation in urban environments, either using global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals or ground-based cellular signals.

					<dc:description>  Recent advancement in digital coding metasurfaces incorporating spatial and
temporal modulation has enabled simultaneous control of electromagnetic (EM)
waves in both space and frequency domains by manipulating incident EM waves in
a transmissive or reflective fashion, resulting in time-reversal asymmetry.
Here we show in theory and experiment that a digitally space-time-coded
metamaterial (MTM) antenna with spatiotemporal modulation at its unit cell
level can be regarded as a radiating counterpart of such digital metasurface,
which will enable nonreciprocal EM wave transmission and reception via
surface-to-leaky-wave transformation and harmonic frequency generation.
Operating in the fast wave (radiation) region, the space-time-coded MTM antenna
is tailored in a way such that the propagation constant of each programmable
unit cell embedded with varactor diodes can toggle between positive and
negative phases, which is done through providing digital sequences by using a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Owing to the time-varying coding
sequence, harmonic frequencies are generated with different main beam
directions. Furthermore, the space time modulation of the digitally coded MTM
antenna allows for nonreciprocal transmission and reception of EM waves by
breaking the time-reversal symmetry, which may enable many applications, such
as simultaneous transmit and receive, unidirectional transmission, radar
sensing, and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) beamformer.

					<dc:description>  Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) correction schemes have shown great

allowing partially periodic systems with smaller periodic cell parameters. In
this work a new PBC correction scheme is presented for DFT calculations with
continuum solvation models. This double-cell formalism allows for faster
calculations with a 60 fold speedup for 1D systems. This formalism can be used
with partially periodic systems as well as dielectric continuum solvation
models. As well as this new PBC correction scheme, the library of
auxillary-function countercharge corrections (LIBAFCC) has been coupled with
the Environ library to allow for a wider range of partially periodic systems.

					<dc:description>  In some machine learning applications the availability of labeled instances
for supervised classification is limited while unlabeled instances are
abundant. Semi-supervised learning algorithms deal with these scenarios and
attempt to exploit the information contained in the unlabeled examples. In this
paper, we address the question of how to evolve neural networks for
semi-supervised problems. We introduce neuroevolutionary approaches that
exploit unlabeled instances by using neuron coverage metrics computed on the
neural network architecture encoded by each candidate solution. Neuron coverage
metrics resemble code coverage metrics used to test software, but are oriented
to quantify how the different neural network components are covered by test
instances. In our neuroevolutionary approach, we define fitness functions that
combine classification accuracy computed on labeled examples and neuron
coverage metrics evaluated using unlabeled examples. We assess the impact of
these functions on semi-supervised problems with a varying amount of labeled
instances. Our results show that the use of neuron coverage metrics helps
neuroevolution to become less sensitive to the scarcity of labeled data, and
can lead in some cases to a more robust generalization of the learned
classifiers.

					<dc:description>  We construct a strong PUF with provable security against ML attacks on both
classical and quantum computers. The security is guaranteed by the
cryptographic hardness of learning decryption functions of public-key
cryptosystems, and the hardness of the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem
defined on integer lattices. We call our construction the lattice PUF.
  We construct lattice PUF with a physically obfuscated key and an LWE
decryption function block. To allow deployments in different scenarios, we
demonstrate designs with different latency-area trade-offs. A compact design
uses a highly serialized LFSR and LWE decryption function, while a
latency-optimized design uses an unrolled LFSR and a parallel datapath.
  We prototype lattice PUF designs with $2^{136}$ challenge-response pairs
(CRPs) on a Spartan 6 FPGA. In addition to theoretical security guarantee, we
evaluate empirical resistance to the various leading ML techniques: the
prediction error remains above $49.76\%$ after $1$ million training CRPs. The
resource-efficient design requires only $45$ slices for the PUF logic proper,
and $351$ slices for a fuzzy extractor. The latency-optimized design achieves a
$148X$ reduction in latency, at a $10X$ increase in PUF hardware utilization.
The mean uniformity of PUF responses is $49.98\%$, the mean uniqueness is
$50.00\%$, and the mean reliability is $1.26\%$.

					<dc:title>The characteristics of the meandering effect in a stratified wake</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Huang, Xinyi</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Physics - Fluid Dynamics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The gradual suppression of the vertical motions and the emergence of
large-scale horizontal structures are characteristics of a stratified wake
flow. We isolate the resulting wake meandering from the stationary velocity,
i.e., the velocity without meandering, by utilizing direct numerical
simulations covering Reynolds numbers $Re_B=UD/\nu$ between $[10 000, 50 000]$
and Froude number $Fr_B=U_B/ND$ between $[2, 50]$ ($U_B$ is the freestream
velocity, $D$ is the characteristic length scale, and $N$ is the buoyancy
frequency). The meandering range is growing in the horizontal direction as the
wake width, but decreases in the vertical direction, opposite to the wake
height. The meandering, especially in the horizontal direction, leads to the
dispersion of the instantaneous velocity and layered flow structures. Thus, the
mean velocity profile deviates from the assumption of two-dimensional
self-similarity in the late wake. Due to the distortion of the mean velocity
profile, the superposition of the meandering to the stationary velocity is
non-trivial. The scaling of the width and the height transitions at different
points, and the scaling of the velocity deficit is further more complicated.
Through theoretical analysis, we obtain and verify the momentum flux equation.
We can accurately measure the impact of the meandering on the scaling of the
lengths, and also the scaling of the velocity deficit.

					<dc:description>  A global trend to miniaturization and multiwavelength performance of
nanophotonic devices drives research on novel phenomena, such as bound states
in the continuum and Mietronics, as well as the survey for high-refractive
index and strongly anisotropic materials and metasurfaces. Hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) is one of promising materials for the future nanophotonics owing
to its inherent anisotropy and prospects of high-quality monocrystals growth
with atomically flat surface. Here, we present highly accurate optical
constants of hBN in the broad wavelength range of 250-1700 nm combining the
imaging ellipsometry measurements scanning near-field optical microscopy and
first-principle quantum mechanical computations. hBN's high refractive index,
up to 2.75 in ultraviolet (UV) and visible range, broadband birefringence of
0.7, and negligible optical losses make it an outstanding material for UV and
visible range photonics. Based on our measurement results, we propose and
design novel optical elements: handedness-preserving mirrors and subwavelength
waveguides with dimensions of 40 nm operating in the visible and UV range,
respectively. Remarkably, our results offer unique opportunity to bridge the
size-gap between photonics and electronics.

					<dc:description>  The generation of spectrally pure high-frequency microwave signals is a
critical functionality in fundamental and applied sciences, including metrology
and communications. The development of optical frequency combs has enabled the
powerful technique of optical frequency division (OFD) to produce microwave
oscillations of the highest quality. The approaches for OFD demonstrated to
date demand multiple lasers with space- and energy-consuming optical
stabilization and electronic feedback components, resulting in device
footprints incompatible with integration into a compact and robust photonic
platform. Here, we demonstrate all-optical OFD on a single photonic chip driven
with a single continuous-wave laser. We generate a dual-point frequency
reference using the beat frequency of the signal and idler fields from a
microresonator-based optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which achieves high
phase stability due to the inherently strong signal-idler frequency
correlations. We implement OFD by optically injecting the signal and idler
fields from the OPO to a Kerr-comb microresonator on the same chip. We show
that the two distinct dynamical states of Kerr cavities can be passively
synchronized, allowing broadband frequency locking of the comb state, which
transfers the stability of the OPO frequencies to the repetition rate of the
Kerr comb. A 630-fold phase-noise reduction is observed when the Kerr comb is
synchronized to the OPO, which represents the lowest noise generated on the
silicon-nitride platform. Our work demonstrates a simple, effective approach
for performing OFD and provides a pathway toward chip-scale devices that can
generate microwave frequencies comparable to the purest tones produced in
metrological laboratories. This technology can significantly boost the further
development of data communications and microwave sensing.

					<dc:description>  Noncollinear magnetic structures and multiple magnetic phase transitions in a
sawtooth lattice antiferromagnet consisting of Cr$^{3+}$ are experimentally
identified in this work, thereby proposing the scenario of magnetism-driven
ferroelectricity in a sawtooth lattice. The title compound, BeCr$_2$O$_4$,
displays three magnetic phase transitions at low temperatures, at
$T_{N1}\approx$ 7.5 K, at $T_{N2}\approx$ 25 K and at $T_{N3}\approx$ 26 K,
revealed through magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and neutron diffraction
in this work. These magnetic phase transitions are found to be influenced by
externally applied magnetic fields. Isothermal magnetization curves at low
temperatures below the magnetic transitions indicate the antiferromagnetic
nature of \bco\ with two spin-flop-like transitions occurring at
$H_{c1}\approx$ 29 kOe and $H_{c2} \approx$ 47 kOe. Our high-resolution X-ray
and neutron diffraction studies, performed on single crystal and powder samples
unambiguously determined the crystal structure as orthorhombic $Pbnm$. By
performing the magnetic superspace group analysis of the neutron diffraction
data at low temperatures, the magnetic structure in the temperature range
$T_{N3,N2} &lt; T &lt; T_{N1}$ is determined to be the polar magnetic space group,
$P21nm.1^{\prime}(00g)0s0s$ with a cycloidal magnetic propagation vector
$\textbf{k}_1$ = (0, 0, 0.090(1)). The magnetic structure in the newly
identified phase below $T_{N1}$, is determined as $P21/b.1^{\prime}[b](00g)00s$
with the magnetic propagation vector $\textbf{k}_2$ = (0, 0, 0.908(1)). The
cycloidal spin structure determined in our work is usually associated with
electric polarization, thereby making \bco\ a promising multiferroic belonging
to the sparsely populated family of sawtooth lattice antiferromagnets.

This family is shown to be closed under elementary equivalence and also
coincides with the family of II$_1$ factors with the Brown property introduced
in arXiv:2004.02293. We show that a certain family of existentially closed
factors, the so-called infinitely generic factors, are uniformly super McDuff,
thereby improving a recent result of arXiv:2205.07442. We also show that Popa's
family of strongly McDuff II$_1$ factors are uniformly super McDuff. Lastly, we
investigate when finitely generic II$_1$ factors are uniformly super McDuff.

					<dc:description>  Recent advancements in AI have coincided with ever-increasing efforts in the
research community to investigate, classify and evaluate various methods aimed
at making AI models explainable. However, most of existing attempts present a
method-centric view of eXplainable AI (XAI) which is typically meaningful only
for domain experts. There is an apparent lack of a robust qualitative and
quantitative performance framework that evaluates the suitability of
explanations for different types of users. We survey relevant efforts, and
then, propose a unified, inclusive and user-centred taxonomy for XAI based on
the principles of General System's Theory, which serves us as a basis for
evaluating the appropriateness of XAI approaches for all user types, including
both developers and end users.

					<dc:title>Reproducing some observed galactic rotation curves without dark matter

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Dark matter has been a long-standing and important issue in physics, but
direct evidence of its existence is lacking. This work aims to elucidate the
mystery and show that the dark matter hypothesis is unnecessary. We can nicely
reproduce the observed rotation curves using only conventional Newtonian
dynamics based on experimental surface brightness profiles of several galaxies.
Our success is based on realizing that the mass radial distribution follows a
stretched exponential decay with a small exponent over a few hundred
kiloparsecs. Our quantitative analysis indicates that for these four example
galaxies, there is no need to invoke the hypothetical dark matter presently
unknown to humans or the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm.

					<dc:description>  The spectral decomposition of graph adjacency matrices is an essential
ingredient in the design of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques. When the
adjacency matrix has multi-dimensional eigenspaces, it is desirable to base GSP
constructions on a particular eigenbasis (the `preferred basis'). In this
paper, we provide an explicit and detailed representation-theoretic account for
the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a Cayley graph, which
results in a preferred basis. Our method applies to all (not necessarily
quasi-Abelian) Cayley graphs, and provides descriptions of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors based on the coefficient functions of the representations of the
underlying group. Next, we use such bases to build frames that are suitable for
developing signal processing on Cayley graphs. These are the Frobenius--Schur
frames and Cayley frames, for which we provide a characterization and a
practical recipe for their construction.

					<dc:description>  Community detection in real-world networks is typically addressed through the
use of graph clustering methods that partition the nodes of a network into
disjoint subsets. While the definition of community may vary, it is generally
accepted that elements of a community should be ``well-connected&quot;. We evaluated
clusters generated by the Leiden algorithm and the Iterative K-core (IKC)
clustering algorithm for their susceptibility to become disconnected by the
deletion of a small number of edges. A striking observation is that for Leiden
clustering of real-world networks, except for cases with large resolution
parameter values, the majority of clusters do not meet the relatively mild
condition we enforce for well-connected clusters. We also constructed a modular
pipeline to enable well-connected output clusters that allows a user-specified
criterion for a valid community considering cluster size and minimum edge cut
size and describe the use of this pipeline on real world and synthetic
networks. An interesting trend we observed is that the final clusterings on
real-world networks had small node coverage, suggesting that not all nodes in a
network belong in communities.

					<dc:description>  Adversarial attacks on a convolutional neural network (CNN) -- injecting
human-imperceptible perturbations into an input image -- could fool a
high-performance CNN into making incorrect predictions. The success of
adversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and
prevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical
diagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics
approach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1)
which neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do
these vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,
we introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking
magnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their
vulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat
ears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the
neuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of
a large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the
neurons' roles in the prediction. To this end, a visual analytics system is
designed to incorporate visual reasoning for interpreting adversarial attacks.
We validate the effectiveness of our system through multiple case studies as
well as feedback from domain experts.

					<dc:description>  The multistage robust unit commitment (UC) is of paramount importance for
achieving reliable operations considering the uncertainty of renewable
realizations. The typical affine decision rule method and the robust feasible
region method may achieve uneconomic dispatches as the dispatch decisions just
rely on the current-stage information. Through approximating the future
cost-to-go functions, the dual dynamic programming based methods have been
shown adaptive to the multistage robust optimization problems, while suffering
from high computational complexity. Thus, we propose the robust approximate
dynamic programming (RADP) method to promote the computational speed and the
economic performance for large-scale robust UC problems. RADP initializes the
candidate points for guaranteeing the feasibility of upper bounding the value
functions, solves the linear McCormick relaxation based bilinear programming to
obtain the worst cases, and combines the primal and dual updates for this
hybrid binary and continuous decision-making problem to achieve fast
convergence. We can verify that the RADP method enjoys a finite termination
guarantee for the multistage robust optimization problems with achieving
suboptimal solutions. Numerical tests on 118-bus and 2383-bus transmission
systems have demonstrated that RADP can approach the suboptimal economic
performance at significantly improved computational efficiency.

					<dc:description>  Intervening CIV absorbers are key tracers of metal-enriched gas in galaxy
halos over cosmic time. Previous studies suggest that the CIV cosmic mass
density ($\Omega_{\rm CIV}$) decreases slowly over 1.5 $\lesssim z\lesssim$ 5
before declining rapidly at $z\gtrsim$ 5, but the cause of this downturn is
poorly understood. We characterize the $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$ evolution over 4.3
$\lesssim z\lesssim$ 6.3 using 260 absorbers found in 42 XSHOOTER spectra of
$z\sim$ 6 quasars, of which 30 come from the ESO Large Program XQR-30. The
large sample enables us to robustly constrain the rate and timing of the
downturn. We find that $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$ decreases by a factor of 4.8 $\pm$
2.0 over the ~300 Myr interval between $z\sim$ 4.7 and $z\sim$ 5.8. The slope
of the column density (log N) distribution function does not change, suggesting
that CIV absorption is suppressed approximately uniformly across 13.2 $\leq$
log N/cm$^{-2}$ &lt; 15.0. Assuming that the carbon content of galaxy halos
evolves as the integral of the cosmic star formation rate density (with some
delay due to stellar lifetimes and outflow travel times), we show that chemical
evolution alone could plausibly explain the fast decline in $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$
over 4.3 $\lesssim z\lesssim$ 6.3. However, the CIV/CII ratio decreases at the
highest redshifts, so the accelerated decline in $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$ at
$z\gtrsim$ 5 may be more naturally explained by rapid changes in the gas
ionization state driven by evolution of the UV background towards the end of
hydrogen reionization.

					<dc:description>  Factor models have found widespread applications in economics and finance,
but the heavy-tailed character of macroeconomic and financial data is often
overlooked in the existing literature. To address this issue and achieve
robustness, we propose an approach to estimate factor loadings and scores by
minimizing the Huber loss function, motivated by the equivalence of
conventional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the constrained least
squares method in the factor model. We provide two algorithms based on
different penalty forms. The first minimizes the $\ell_2$-norm-type Huber loss,
performing PCA on the weighted sample covariance matrix and is named Huber PCA.
The second version minimizes the element-wise type Huber loss and can be solved
by an iterative Huber regression algorithm. We investigate the theoretical
minimizer of the element-wise Huber loss function and show that it has the same
convergence rate as conventional PCA under finite second-moment conditions on
idiosyncratic errors. Additionally, we propose a consistent model selection
criterion based on rank minimization to determine the number of factors
robustly. We demonstrate the advantages of Huber PCA using a real financial
portfolio selection example, and an R package called ``HDRFA&quot; is available on
CRAN to conduct robust factor analysis.

					<dc:description>  Living cells are characterized by the micrometric confinement of various
macromolecules at high concentrations. Using droplets containing binary polymer
blends as artificial cells, we previously showed that cell-sized confinement
causes phase separation of the binary polymer solutions because of the
length-dependent wetting of the polymers. Here we demonstrate that the
wetting-induced heterogeneity of polymers also emerges in single-component
polymer solutions. The resulting heterogeneity leads to a slower transport of
small molecules at the center of cell-sized droplets than that in bulk
solutions. This heterogeneous distribution is observed when longer polymers
with lower wettability are localized at the droplet center. Molecular
simulations support this wetting-induced heterogeneous distribution by polymer
length. Our results suggest that cell-sized confinement functions as a
structural regulator for polydisperse polymer solutions that specifically
manipulate the diffusion of molecules, particularly those with sizes close to
the correlation length of the polymer chains.

					<dc:description>  Artificial intelligence (AI) has a history of nearly a century from its
inception to the present day. We have summarized the development trends and
discovered universal rules, including both success and failure. We have
analyzed the reasons from both technical and philosophical perspectives to help
understand the reasons behind the past failures and current successes of AI,
and to provide a basis for thinking and exploring future development.
Specifically, we have found that the development of AI in different fields,
including computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning,
follows a pattern from rules to statistics to data-driven methods. In the face
of past failures and current successes, we need to think systematically about
the reasons behind them. Given the unity of AI between natural and social
sciences, it is necessary to incorporate philosophical thinking to understand
and solve AI problems, and we believe that starting from the dialectical method
of Marx is a feasible path. We have concluded that the sustainable development
direction of AI should be human-machine collaboration and a technology path
centered on computing power. Finally, we have summarized the impact of AI on
society from this trend.

					<dc:description>  Despite increasing popularity in empirical studies, the integration of
machine learning generated variables into regression models for statistical
inference suffers from the measurement error problem, which can bias estimation
and threaten the validity of inferences. In this paper, we develop a novel
approach to alleviate associated estimation biases. Our proposed approach,
EnsembleIV, creates valid and strong instrumental variables from weak learners
in an ensemble model, and uses them to obtain consistent estimates that are
robust against the measurement error problem. Our empirical evaluations, using
both synthetic and real-world datasets, show that EnsembleIV can effectively
reduce estimation biases across several common regression specifications, and
can be combined with modern deep learning techniques when dealing with
unstructured data.

					<dc:description>  The explicit compact expression for the susceptibility tensor of a single
photon wave packet on the photon mass-shell is derived. It is assumed that the
probe photon is hard, the test photon is soft, and their total energy is below
the electron-positron pair creation threshold. It turns out that a single
photon wave packet can be regarded as a birefringent gyrotropic dispersive
medium in the process of light-by-light scattering. The explicit expression for
the inclusive probability to record the probe photon in the process of
light-by-light scattering is obtained in the first nontrivial order of
perturbation theory where the interference effect of the free passed and
scattered parts of the photon wave function dominates. This effect is of order
$\alpha^2$ in contrast to the standard contribution to the light-by-light
scattering cross-section which is of order $\alpha^4$. The possible nontrivial
shapes of the wave functions of probe and test photons are taken into account.
The evolution of the Stokes parameters of a probe photon is described. The
change of the Stokes parameters is rather large for hard probe photons and
sufficiently intense beams of soft test photons.

					<dc:description>  We revisit the calculation of the electron, neutron, and proton electric
dipole moments (EDMs) in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model
(CMSSM). The relatively large mass of the Higgs boson, $m_H \simeq 125$ GeV
coupled with the (as yet) lack of discovery of any supersymmetric particle at
the LHC, has pushed the supersymmetry breaking scale to several TeV or higher.
Though one might expect this decoupling to have relaxed completely any bounds
on the two CP violating phases in the CMSSM ($\theta_\mu$ and $\theta_A$), the
impressive experimental improvements in the limits on the EDMs (particularly
the electron EDM) still allow us to set constraints of order $(0.01 - 0.1)\pi$
on $\theta_A$ and $(0.001 - 0.1)\pi$ on $\theta_\mu$. We also discuss the
impact of future improvements in the experimental limits on supersymmetric
models.

					<dc:description>  Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated torsion-free group. We show that the
statement of $\Gamma$ being virtually abelian is equivalent to the statement
that the $*$-regular closure of the group ring $\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]$ in the
algebra of (unbounded) operators affiliated to the group von Neumann algebra is
a central division algebra. More generally, for any field $k$, it is shown that
$k[\Gamma]$ embeds into a central division algebra in case $\Gamma$ is
virtually abelian. We take advantage of this result in order to develop a
criterion for existence of units in the group ring $k[\Gamma]$. We develop this
criterion in the particular case of $\Gamma$ being the Promislow's group.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we theoretically study the charge order and orbital magnetic
properties of a new type of antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe. Based on first
principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have studied the
electronic structures, Fermi-surface quantum fluctuations, as well as phonon
properties of the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe. We find that charge
density wave emerges in such a system due to a subtle cooperation between
electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions and electron-phonon couplings, which
gives rise to an unusual scenario of interaction-triggered phonon
instabilities, and eventually yields a charge density wave (CDW) state. We
further show that, in the CDW phase, the ground-state current density
distribution exhibits an intriguing star-of-David pattern, leading to flux
density modulation. The orbital fluxes (or current loops) in this system
emerges as a result of the subtle interplay between magnetism, lattice
geometries, charge order, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be described
by a simple, yet universal, tight-binding theory including a Kane-Mele type SOC
term and a magnetic exchange interaction. We further study the origin of the
peculiar step-edge states in FeGe, which shed light on the topological
properties and correlation effects in this new type of kagome antiferromagnetic
material.

					<dc:description>  Algorithms are developed for the quickest detection of a change in
statistically periodic processes. These are processes in which the statistical
properties are nonstationary but repeat after a fixed time interval. It is
assumed that the pre-change law is known to the decision maker but the
post-change law is unknown. In this framework, three families of problems are
studied: robust quickest change detection, joint quickest change detection and
classification, and multislot quickest change detection. In the multislot
problem, the exact slot within a period where a change may occur is unknown.
Algorithms are proposed for each problem, and either exact optimality or
asymptotic optimal in the low false alarm regime is proved for each of them.
The developed algorithms are then used for anomaly detection in traffic data
and arrhythmia detection and identification in electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
The effectiveness of the algorithms is also demonstrated on simulated data.

					<dc:description>  A fully discrete implicit scheme is proposed for the Swift-Hohenberg model,
combining the third-order backward differentiation formula (BDF3) for the time
discretization and the second-order finite difference scheme for the space
discretization. Applying the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the positive
definiteness of the convolution coefficients of BDF3, the presented numerical
algorithm is proved to be uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable,
further, the numerical solution is shown to be bounded in the maximum norm. The
proposed scheme is rigorously proved to be convergent in $L^2$ norm by the
discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernel, which transfer the
four-level-solution form into the three-level-gradient form for the
approximation of the temporal derivative. Consequently, the error estimate for
the numerical solution is established by utilization of the discrete Gronwall
inequality. Numerical examples in 2D and 3D cases are provided to support the
theoretical results.

					<dc:description>  Robust PCA is a standard tool for learning a linear subspace in the presence
of sparse corruption or rare outliers. What about robustly learning manifolds
that are more realistic models for natural data, such as images? There have
been several recent attempts to generalize robust PCA to manifold settings. In
this paper, we propose $\ell_1$- and scaling-invariant $\ell_1/\ell_2$-robust
autoencoders based on a surprisingly compact formulation built on the intuition
that deep autoencoders perform manifold learning. We demonstrate on several
standard image datasets that the proposed formulation significantly outperforms
all previous methods in collectively removing sparse corruption, without clean
images for training. Moreover, we also show that the learned manifold
structures can be generalized to unseen data samples effectively.

approaches. We describe in simple terms, explanations in data management and

found in the area of causality. We elaborate on the importance of logical
reasoning when dealing with counterfactuals, and their use for score
computation.

					<dc:description>  It is imperative to compile quantum circuits for Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices because of the limited connectivity of physical qubits
and the high error rates of gate operations. One of the most critical steps in
quantum circuit compilation is qubit routing, an NP-Hard problem that involves
placing and moving logical qubits to minimize compilation overhead. In this
study, we propose ISing mAchine Assisted Quantum compiler (ISAAQ) to perform
qubit routing with Ising machines, which can efficiently solve Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. ISAAQ accurately estimates
the compilation costs by updating itself using previous compilation results,
and accelerates qubit routing by solving QUBO problems in parallel with
multiple Ising machines. In addition, ISAAQ exploits a cost-reduction method
that implements commutative logical Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates with fewer
physical CNOT gates, which is particularly effective for planar devices when
implementing original gates. Experimental results on both IBM QX5 and IBM QX20
show that ISAAQ outperforms the heuristic methods available in Qiskit and tket,
as well as an existing QUBO method, requiring fewer physical CNOT gates for
most benchmark circuits. ISAAQ performs particularly well on large circuits,
demonstrating its strong scalability with respect to the number of logical CNOT
gates.

					<dc:description>  We demonstrate feedback cooling of all the external degrees of freedom of a
near-spherical neutral nanoparticle. The three translational motions are
optically cooled to near the ground state, with a lowest occupation number of
0.69(18) for one degree. A tight, anisotropic optical confinement allows us to
clearly observe three rotational oscillations and to identify the ratio of two
radii to the longest radius with a precision of 10 ppm, corresponding to 4 pm
in diameter. We develop a thermometry for three rotational oscillations and
realize feedback cooling of them to temperatures of lower than 0.1 K by
electrically controlling the electric dipole moment of the nanoparticle. Our
work not only paves the way to precisely characterize trapped nanoparticles,
but also forms the basis of utilizing them for acceleration sensing and for
exploring quantum mechanical behaviors with both their translational and
rotational degrees of freedom.

					<dc:description>  The harmonic numbers are the sequence 1, 1+1/2, 1+1/2+1/3, ... Their
asymptotic difference from the sequence of the natural logarithm of the
positive integers is Euler's constant gamma. We define a family of natural
generalizations of the harmonic numbers. The jth iterated harmonic numbers are
a sequence of rational numbers that nests the previous sequences and relates in
a similar way to the sequence of the jth iterate of the natural logarithm of
positive integers. The analogues of several well-known properties of the
harmonic numbers also hold for the iterated harmonic numbers, including a
generalization of Euler's constant. We reproduce the proof that only the first
harmonic number is an integer and, providing some numeric evidence for the
cases j = 2 and j = 3, conjecture that the same result holds for all iterated
harmonic numbers. We also review another proposed generalization of harmonic
numbers.

					<dc:description>  Conventional temporal causal discovery (CD) methods suffer from high
dimensionality, fail to identify lagged causal relationships, and often ignore
dynamics in relations. In this study, we present a novel constraint-based CD
approach for autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data (eCDANs)
capable of detecting lagged and contemporaneous causal relationships along with
temporal changes. eCDANs addresses high dimensionality by optimizing the
conditioning sets while conducting conditional independence (CI) tests and
identifies the changes in causal relations by introducing a surrogate variable
to represent time dependency. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show
that eCDANs can identify time influence and outperform the baselines.

					<dc:description>  We present the timing of the first five millisecond pulsars discovered in the
globular cluster Omega Centauri and the discovery of a pulsar with a spin
period of 3.68 ms. With a timing baseline of $\sim$3.5 yr we are able to
measure the derivative of the spin frequency ($\dot{\nu}$) for the first five
pulsars. Upper limits on the pulsar line-of-sight acceleration are estimated
and compared with predictions based on analytical models of the cluster. We
find that PSRs J1326$-$4728B and D show large negative accelerations, which are
in tension with the minimum acceleration predicted by analytical models. We
searched for pulsed $\gamma$-ray signals using 14.3 yr of data from the Fermi
Large Area Telescope. Although we found no evidence for $\gamma$-ray
pulsations, PSRs~J1326$-$4728A, B, C and E are associated with X-ray sources.
This suggests that the observed $\gamma$-ray emission from Omega Centauri is
likely caused by the emission of the ensemble of MSPs. Finally, the linearly
polarised emission from PSR J1326$-$4728A yields a rotation measure of
$-18\pm8$ rad m$^{-2}$.

					<dc:description>  Traffic scene parsing is one of the most important tasks to achieve
intelligent cities. So far, little effort has been spent on constructing
datasets specifically for the task of traffic scene parsing. To fill this gap,
here we introduce the TSP6K dataset, containing 6,000 urban traffic images and
spanning hundreds of street scenes under various weather conditions. In
contrast to most previous traffic scene datasets collected from a driving
platform, the images in our dataset are from the shooting platform high-hanging
on the street. Such traffic images can capture more crowded street scenes with
several times more traffic participants than the driving scenes. Each image in
the TSP6K dataset is provided with high-quality pixel-level and instance-level
annotations. We perform a detailed analysis for the dataset and comprehensively
evaluate the state-of-the-art scene parsing methods. Considering the vast
difference in instance sizes, we propose a detail refining decoder, which
recovers the details of different semantic regions in traffic scenes.
Experiments have shown its effectiveness in parsing high-hanging traffic
scenes. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

					<dc:description>  The rapid development of Artificial IntelligenceGenerated Content (AIGC) has
brought daunting challenges regarding service latency, security, and
trustworthiness. Recently, researchers presented the edge AIGC paradigm,
effectively optimize the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge
devices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to
tampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible
digital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack
of trustworthiness in open networks. In this article, for the first time, we
present a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC
products. Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to
protect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we
design an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions
of the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we
build a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC
producers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable
to handle their services. Through numerical results, the superiority of the
proposed approach is demonstrated. Last but not least, we discuss important
open directions for further research.

					<dc:description>  In ordinary quantum field theory, one can define the algebra of observables
in a given region in spacetime, but in the presence of gravity, it is expected
that this notion ceases to be well-defined. A substitute that appears to make
sense in the presence of gravity and that also is more operationally meaningful
is to consider the algebra of observables along the timelike worldline of an
observer. It is known that such an algebra can be defined in quantum field
theory, and the timelike tube theorem of quantum field theory suggests that
such an algebra is a good substitute for what in the absence of gravity is the
algebra of a region. The static patch in de Sitter space is a concrete example
in which it is useful to think in these terms and to explicitly incorporate an
observer in the description.

					<dc:description>  Contact tracing has been considered as an effective measure to limit the
transmission of infectious disease such as COVID-19. Trajectory-based contact
tracing compares the trajectories of users with the patients, and allows the
tracing of both direct contacts and indirect contacts. Although trajectory data
is widely considered as sensitive and personal data, there is limited research
on how to securely compare trajectories of users and patients to conduct
contact tracing with excellent accuracy, high efficiency, and strong privacy
guarantee. Traditional Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) techniques suffer
from prohibitive running time, which prevents their adoption in large cities
with millions of users. In this work, we propose a technical framework called
ContactGuard to achieve accurate, efficient, and privacy-preserving
trajectory-based contact tracing. It improves the efficiency of the MPC-based
baseline by selecting only a small subset of locations of users to compare
against the locations of the patients, with the assist of
Geo-Indistinguishability, a differential privacy notion for Location-based
services (LBS) systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContactGuard
runs up to 2.6$\times$ faster than the MPC baseline, with no sacrifice in terms
of the accuracy of contact tracing.

					<dc:description>  The phase-shifting digital holography (PSDH) is a widely used approach for
recovering signals by their interference (with reference waves) intensity
measurements. Such measurements are traditionally from multiple shots
(corresponding to multiple reference waves). However, the imaging of dynamic
signals requires a single-shot PSDH approach, namely, such an approach depends
only on the intensity measurements from the interference with a single
reference wave. In this paper, based on the uniform admissibility of plane (or
spherical) reference wave and the interference intensity-based approximation to
quasi-interference intensity, the nonnegative refinable function is applied to
establish the single-shot PSDH in Sobolev space. Our approach is conducted by
the intensity measurements from the interference of the signal with a single
reference wave. The main results imply that the approximation version from such
a single-shot approach converges exponentially to the signal as the level
increases. Moreover, like the transport of intensity equation (TIE), our
results can be interpreted from the perspective of intensity difference.

					<dc:description>  This paper studies model checking for general parametric regression models
with no dimension reduction structure on the high-dimensional vector of
predictors. Using existing test as an initial test, this paper combines the
sample-splitting technique and conditional studentization approach to construct
a COnditionally Studentized Test(COST). Unlike existing tests, whether the
initial test is global or local smoothing-based, and whether the dimension of
the predictor vector and the number of parameters are fixed, or diverge at a
certain rate as the sample size goes to infinity, the proposed test always has
a normal weak limit under the null hypothesis. Further, the test can detect the
local alternatives distinct from the null hypothesis at the fastest possible
rate of convergence in hypothesis testing. We also discuss the optimal sample
splitting in power performance. The numerical studies offer information on its
merits and limitations in finite sample cases. As a generic methodology, it
could be applied to other testing problems.

					<dc:description>  Natural language understanding(NLU) is challenging for finance due to the
lack of annotated data and the specialized language in that domain. As a
result, researchers have proposed to use pre-trained language model and
multi-task learning to learn robust representations. However, aggressive
fine-tuning often causes over-fitting and multi-task learning may favor tasks
with significantly larger amounts data, etc. To address these problems, in this
paper, we investigate model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm(MAML) in
low-resource financial NLU tasks. Our contribution includes: 1. we explore the
performance of MAML method with multiple types of tasks: GLUE datasets, SNLI,
Sci-Tail and Financial PhraseBank; 2. we study the performance of MAML method
with multiple single-type tasks: a real scenario stock price prediction problem
with twitter text data. Our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance
according to the experimental results, which demonstrate that our method can
adapt fast and well to low-resource situations.

					<dc:description>  A spatial data federation is a collection of data owners (e.g., a consortium
of taxi companies), and collectively it could provide better location-based
services (LBS). For example, car-hailing services over a spatial data
federation allow end users to easily pick the best offers. We focus on the
range counting queries, which are primitive operations in spatial databases but
received little attention in related research, especially considering the
privacy requirements from data owners, who are reluctant to disclose their
proprietary data. We propose a grouping-based technical framework named
FedGroup, which groups data owners without compromising privacy, and achieves
superior query accuracy (up to 50% improvement) as compared to directly
applying existing privacy mechanisms achieving Differential Privacy (DP). Our
experimental results also demonstrate that FedGroup runs orders-of-magnitude
faster than traditional Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) based method, and
FedGroup even scales to millions of data owners, which is a common setting in
the era of ubiquitous mobile devices.

					<dc:description>  Augmented Reality (AR) applications are becoming more mainstream, with
successful examples in the mobile environment like Pokemon GO. Current
malicious techniques can exploit these environments' immersive and mixed nature
(physical-virtual) to trick users into providing more personal information,
i.e., dark patterns. Dark patterns are deceiving techniques (e.g., interface
tricks) designed to influence individuals' behavioural decisions. However,
there are few studies regarding dark patterns' potential issues in AR
environments. In this work, using scenario construction to build our
prototypes, we investigate the potential future approaches that dark patterns
can have. We use VR mockups in our user study to analyze the effects of dark
patterns in AR. Our study indicates that dark patterns are effective in
immersive scenarios, and the use of novel techniques such as `haptic grabbing'
to drag participants' attention can influence their movements. Finally, we
discuss the impact of such malicious techniques and what techniques can
mitigate them.

					<dc:description>  Aerodynamic performance evaluation is an important part of the aircraft
aerodynamic design optimization process; however, traditional methods are
costly and time-consuming. Despite the fact that various machine learning
methods can achieve high accuracy, their application in engineering is still
difficult due to their poor generalization performance and &quot;black box&quot; nature.
In this paper, a knowledge-embedded meta learning model, which fully integrates
data with the theoretical knowledge of the lift curve, is developed to obtain
the lift coefficients of an arbitrary supercritical airfoil under various angle
of attacks. In the proposed model, a primary network is responsible for
representing the relationship between the lift and angle of attack, while the
geometry information is encoded into a hyper network to predict the unknown
parameters involved in the primary network. Specifically, three models with
different architectures are trained to provide various interpretations.
Compared to the ordinary neural network, our proposed model can exhibit better
generalization capability with competitive prediction accuracy. Afterward,
interpretable analysis is performed based on the Integrated Gradients and
Saliency methods. Results show that the proposed model can tend to assess the
influence of airfoil geometry to the physical characteristics. Furthermore, the
exceptions and shortcomings caused by the proposed model are analysed and
discussed in detail.

					<dc:description>  Coherence and tunneling play central roles in quantum phenomena. In a
tunneling event, the time that a particle spends inside the barrier has been
fiercely debated. This problem becomes more complex when tunneling repeatedly
occurs back and forth, and when involving many particles. Here we report the
measurement of the coherence time of various charge states tunneling in a
nanowire-based tunable Josephson junction; including single charges, multiple
charges, and Cooper pairs. We studied all the charge tunneling processes using
Landau-Zener-St\&quot;uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry, and observed
high-quality interference patterns. In particular, the coherence time of the
charge states was extracted from the interference fringes in Fourier space. In
addition, our measurements show the break-up of Cooper pairs, from a
macroscopic quantum coherent state to individual particle states. Besides the
fundamental research interest, our results also establish LZSM interferometry
as a powerful technique to explore the coherence time of charges in hybrid
devices.

					<dc:description>  The literature on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been overwhelmed
by deep neural networks, yielding state-of-the-art results for ABSA. However,
these deep models are susceptible to learning spurious correlations between
input features and output labels, which in general suffer from poor robustness
and generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Variational
Information Bottleneck framework (called CVIB) to reduce spurious correlations
for ABSA. The proposed CVIB framework is composed of an original network and a
self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized simultaneously via
contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational Information
Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed network
(self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the superfluous
patterns or spurious correlations between input features and prediction labels.
Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull together
semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs, where the
representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned networks
respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations of two
different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair.
Extensive experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets demonstrate that our CVIB
method achieves better performance than the strong competitors in terms of
overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization.

					<dc:description>  The application of sodium laser guide star is the key difference between
modern adaptive optics system and traditional adaptive optics system.
Especially in system like multi-conjugate adaptive optics, sodium laser guide
star asterism which is formed by several laser guide stars in certain pattern
is required to probe more atmospheric turbulence in different directions. To
achieve this, a sodium laser guide star asterism launching platform is
required. In this paper, we will introduce the sodium laser guide star asterism
launching platform built and tested on the 1.8m telescope of the Gaomeigu
Observatory. The platform has two functions: one is to compare the performance
of sodium laser guide stars generated by different lasers at the same place;
the other is to generate sodium laser guide star asterism with adjustable
shape. The field test results at the beginning of 2021 verify the important
role of the platform, which is also the first time to realize sodium laser
guide star asterism in China.

					<dc:description>  EuTe4 is a newly-discovered van der Waals material exhibiting a novel
charge-density wave (CDW) with a large thermal hysteresis in the resistivity
and CDW gap. In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and
transport properties of EuTe4 using high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetoresistance measurements, and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observe a CDW gap of about 200 meV at
low temperatures that persists up to 400 K, suggesting that the CDW transition
occurs at a much higher temperature. We observe a large thermal hysteretic
behavior of the ARPES intensity near the Fermi level, consistent with the
resistivity measurement. The hysteresis in the resistivity measurement does not
change under a magnetic field up to 7 T, excluding the thermal magnetic
hysteresis mechanism. Instead, the surface topography measured with STM shows
surface domains with different CDW trimerization directions, which may be
important for the thermal hysteretic behavior of EuTe4. Interestingly, we
observe a large negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures that can be
associated with the canting of magnetically ordered Eu spins. Our work shed
light on the understanding of magnetic, transport, and electronic properties of
EuTe4.

					<dc:description>  Beam codebooks are a recent feature to enable high dimension multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) in 5G new radio (NR). Codebooks comprised of
customizable beamforming weights can be used to transmit reference signals and
aid the channel state information (CSI) acquisition process. In this paper, we
characterize the role of each codebook used during the beam management process
and design a neural network to find codebooks that improve overall system
performance. Evaluating a codebook is not purely about maximizing signal power,
but instead, a holistic, system-level view of effective spectral efficiency is
necessary to capture the relationships between codebooks, feedback, and
spectral efficiency. The proposed algorithm is built on translating codebook
and feedback knowledge into a consistent beamspace basis similar to a virtual
channel model to generate initial access codebooks and select the subsequent
refined beam training. This beamspace codebook algorithm is designed to
directly integrate with current 5G beam management standards. Simulation
results show that the neural network codebooks improve over traditional
codebooks in received signal power, even in dispersive sub-6GHz environments.
We further utilize our simulation framework to evaluate type-II CSI feedback
formats with regard to effective multi-user spectral efficiency. Our results
suggest that optimizing codebook performance can provide valuable spectral
efficiency improvements, but 5G feedback quantization resolution limits
multi-user performance in sub-6GHz bands due to the rich scattering
environment.

					<dc:description>  Recommender Systems (RS) aim to provide personalized suggestions of items for
users against consumer over-choice. Although extensive research has been
conducted to address different aspects and challenges of RS, there still exists
a gap between academic research and industrial applications. Specifically, most
of the existing models still work in an offline manner, in which the
recommender is trained on a large static training set and evaluated on a very
restrictive testing set in a one-time process. RS will stay unchanged until the
next batch retrain is performed. We frame such RS as Batch Update Recommender
Systems (BURS). In reality, they have to face the challenges where RS are
expected to be instantly updated with new data streaming in, and generate
updated recommendations for current user activities based on the newly arrived
data. We frame such RS as Incremental Update Recommender Systems (IURS).
  In this article, we offer a systematic survey of incremental update for
neural recommender systems. We begin the survey by introducing key concepts and
formulating the task of IURS. We then illustrate the challenges in IURS
compared with traditional BURS. Afterwards, we detail the introduction of
existing literature and evaluation issues. We conclude the survey by outlining
some prominent open research issues in this area.

					<dc:description>  We construct a model of the quintessence axion based on a gauged chiral
$U(1)$ symmetry and an additional flat fifth dimension. The required high
qualities are guaranteed by the brane separation. The observed cosmological
constant (i.e. the potential energy of the quintessence axion) is determined by
the size of the extra dimension and the axion decay constant $F_a$ is fixed
almost at $F_a\simeq10^{17}\,{\rm GeV}$, which is sufficiently large for the
stability of the axion field near the hilltop of its potential. Furthermore,
the movement of the axion can also easily explain the recently reported
isotropic cosmic birefringence of the cosmic microwave background photon.

					<dc:title>Toward finiteness of central configurations for the planar six-body

					<dc:description>  In this paper we develop symbolic computation algorithms to investigate
finiteness of central configurations for the planar $n$-body problem. Our
approach is based on Albouy-Kaloshin's work on finiteness of central
configurations for the 5-body problems. In their paper, bicolored graphs called
$zw$-diagrams were introduced for possible scenarios when the finiteness
conjecture fails, and proving finiteness amounts to exclusions of central
configurations associated to these diagrams. Following their method, the amount
of computations becomes enormous when there are more than five bodies. Here we
introduce matrix algebra for determination of both diagrams and asymptotic
orders, devise several criteria to reduce computational complexity, and verify
finiteness mostly through automated deductions. For the planar six-body
problem, our first algorithm effectively narrows the proof for finiteness down
to 117 $zw$-diagrams, the second algorithm eliminates 31 of them, the last
algorithm eliminates 62 other diagrams except for masses in some co-dimension 2
variety in the mass space, and leaving 24 cases unsolved.

					<dc:description>  Various optimal gradient-based algorithms have been developed for smooth
nonconvex optimization. However, many nonconvex machine learning problems do
not belong to the class of smooth functions and therefore the existing
algorithms are sub-optimal. Instead, these problems have been shown to satisfy
certain generalized-smooth conditions, which have not been well understood in
the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a notion of
$\alpha$-symmetric generalized-smoothness that substantially extends the
existing notions and covers many important functions such as high-order
polynomials and exponential functions. We study the fundamental properties and
establish descent lemmas for the functions in this class. Then, to solve such a
large class of nonconvex problems, we design a special deterministic normalized
gradient descent algorithm that achieves the optimal iteration complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, and also prove that the popular SPIDER variance
reduction algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our results show that solving generalized-smooth
nonconvex problems is as efficient as solving smooth nonconvex problems.

					<dc:description>  Harvey Friedman gives a comparatively short description of an ``unimaginably
large'' number $n(3)$ , beyond, e.g. the values $$ A(7,184)&lt; A({7198},158386) &lt;
n(3)$$ of Ackermann's function - but finite. We implement Friedman's
combinatorial problem about subwords of words over a 3-letter alphabet on a
family of Turing machines, which, starting on empty tape, run (more than)
$n(3)$ steps, and then halt. Examples include a (44,8) (symbol,state count)
machine as well as a (276,2) and a (2,1840) one. In total, there are at most
37022 non-trivial pairs $(n,m)$ with Busy Beaver values ${\tt BB(n,m)} &lt;
A(7198,158386).$ We give algorithms to map any $(|Q|,|E|)$ TM to another, where
we can choose freely either $|Q'|\geq 2$ or $|E'|\geq 2$ (the case $|Q'|=2$ for
empty initial tape is the tricky one). Given the size of $n(3)$ and the fact
that these TMs are not {\it holdouts}, but assured to stop, Friedman's
combinatorial problem provides a definite upper bound on what might ever be
possible to achieve in the Busy Beaver contest. We also treat $n(4)&gt;
A^{(A(187196))}(1)$.

					<dc:description>  Charged excitations are electronic transitions that involve a change in the
total charge of a molecule or material. Understanding the properties and
reactivity of charged species requires insights from theoretical calculations
that can accurately describe orbital relaxation and electron correlation
effects in open-shell electronic states. In this perspective, we review the
current state of algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory for
simulating charged excitations and its recent developments. We start with a
short overview of ADC formalism for the one-particle Green's function,
including its single- and multireference formulations and extension to periodic
systems. Next, we focus on the capabilities of ADC methods and discuss recent
findings about their accuracy for calculating a wide range of excited-state
properties. We conclude our perspective by outlining possible directions for
future developments of this theoretical approach.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Background subtraction is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous
real-world applications, ranging from object tracking to video surveillance.
Dynamic backgrounds poses a significant challenge here. Supervised deep
learning-based techniques are currently considered state-of-the-art for this
task. However, these methods require pixel-wise ground-truth labels, which can
be time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised
framework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel
ground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence
of images and comprises two networks. The first network is an autoencoder that
generates background images and prepares dynamic background images for training
the second network. The dynamic background images are obtained by thresholding
the background-subtracted images. The second network is a U-Net that uses the
same object-free video for training and the dynamic background images as
pixel-wise ground-truth labels. During the test phase, the input images are
processed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic
background images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove
dynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a
foreground image that is free of dynamic artifacts. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on selected categories of
the CDnet 2014 dataset and the I2R dataset. Our method outperformed all
top-ranked unsupervised methods. We also achieved better results than one of
the two existing weakly supervised methods, and our performance was similar to
the other. Our proposed method is online, real-time, efficient, and requires
minimal frame-level annotation, making it suitable for a wide range of
real-world applications.

					<dc:description>  Tactile sensing is essential for robots to perceive and react to the
environment. However, it remains a challenge to make large-scale and flexible
tactile skins on robots. Industrial machine knitting provides solutions to
manufacture customizable fabrics. Along with functional yarns, it can produce
highly customizable circuits that can be made into tactile skins for robots. In
this work, we present RobotSweater, a machine-knitted pressure-sensitive
tactile skin that can be easily applied on robots. We design and fabricate a
parameterized multi-layer tactile skin using off-the-shelf yarns, and
characterize our sensor on both a flat testbed and a curved surface to show its
robust contact detection, multi-contact localization, and pressure sensing
capabilities. The sensor is fabricated using a well-established textile
manufacturing process with a programmable industrial knitting machine, which
makes it highly customizable and low-cost. The textile nature of the sensor
also makes it easily fit curved surfaces of different robots and have a
friendly appearance. Using our tactile skins, we conduct closed-loop control
with tactile feedback for two applications: (1) human lead-through control of a
robot arm, and (2) human-robot interaction with a mobile robot.

					<dc:description>  The analytic inference, e.g. predictive distribution being in closed form,
may be an appealing benefit for machine learning practitioners when they treat
wide neural networks as Gaussian process in Bayesian setting. The realistic
widths, however, are finite and cause weak deviation from the Gaussianity under
which partial marginalization of random variables in a model is
straightforward. On the basis of multivariate Edgeworth expansion, we propose a
non-Gaussian distribution in differential form to model a finite set of outputs
from a random neural network, and derive the corresponding marginal and
conditional properties. Thus, we are able to derive the non-Gaussian posterior
distribution in Bayesian regression task. In addition, in the bottlenecked deep
neural networks, a weight space representation of deep Gaussian process, the
non-Gaussianity is investigated through the marginal kernel.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks based on layer-stacking architectures have historically
suffered from poor inherent interpretability. Meanwhile, symbolic probabilistic
models function with clear interpretability, but how to combine them with
neural networks to enhance their performance remains to be explored. In this
paper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a
structured language model. We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to
explicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without
requiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language
model learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only
raw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes
it essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification
model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach could achieve good
prediction accuracy in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, the predicted span labels
are consistent with human rationales to a certain degree.

efficiently adapting large language models to multiple downstream tasks.
However, existing methods typically learn soft prompt vectors from scratch, and
it has not been clear how to exploit the rich cross-task knowledge with prompt
vectors in a multitask learning setting. We propose multitask prompt tuning
(MPT), which first learns a single transferable prompt by distilling knowledge
from multiple task-specific source prompts. We then learn multiplicative low
rank updates to this shared prompt to efficiently adapt it to each downstream
target task. Extensive experiments on 23 NLP datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the full
finetuning baseline in some cases, despite only tuning 0.035% as many
task-specific parameters.

					<dc:description>  Event camera shows great potential in 3D hand pose estimation, especially
addressing the challenges of fast motion and high dynamic range in a low-power
way. However, due to the asynchronous differential imaging mechanism, it is
challenging to design event representation to encode hand motion information
especially when the hands are not moving (causing motion ambiguity), and it is
infeasible to fully annotate the temporally dense event stream. In this paper,
we propose EvHandPose with novel hand flow representations in Event-to-Pose
module for accurate hand pose estimation and alleviating the motion ambiguity
issue. To solve the problem under sparse annotation, we design contrast
maximization and edge constraints in Pose-to-IWE (Image with Warped Events)
module and formulate EvHandPose in a self-supervision framework. We further
build EvRealHands, the first large-scale real-world event-based hand pose
dataset on several challenging scenes to bridge the domain gap due to relying
on synthetic data and facilitate future research. Experiments on EvRealHands
demonstrate that EvHandPose outperforms previous event-based method under all
evaluation scenes with 15 $\sim$ 20 mm lower MPJPE and achieves accurate and
stable hand pose estimation in fast motion and strong light scenes compared
with RGB-based methods. Furthermore, EvHandPose demonstrates 3D hand pose
estimation at 120 fps or higher.

					<dc:creator>Ruohonen, Jukka</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  There is an increasing supply and demand for political advertising throughout
the world. At the same time, societal threats, such election interference by
foreign governments and other bad actors, continues to be a pressing concern in
many democracies. Furthermore, manipulation of electoral outcomes, whether by
foreign or domestic forces, continues to be a concern of many citizens who are
also worried about their fundamental rights. To these ends, the European Union
(EU) has launched several initiatives for tackling the issues. A new regulation
was proposed in 2020 also for improving the transparency of political
advertising in the union. This short commentary reviews the regulation and
raises a few points about its limitations and potential impacts.

					<dc:description>  It is well-known that three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from
intersecting D6-branes, where either one or both of the ${\rm U}(2)$ gauge
factors are replaced by a ${\rm USp}(2)$ group, are quite scarce. In order to
construct all such kind of models with generic additional gauge symmetries, we
fix the observable sectors and study all the possible hidden sectors. Thus, we
are able to completely determine all types of such kind of the inequivalent
models on a $\mathbbm{T}^6/(\mathbbm{Z}_2\times \mathbbm{Z}_2)$ orientifold
from IIA string theory. We find the gauge coupling relations to be highly
sensitive to the variations in the hidden sector. One of the models exhibits
the gauge coupling unification for a particular solution at the string scale.

					<dc:description>  Charge order has recently been revealed in infinite-layer nickelates as a
broken symmetry state in addition to superconductivity. Its root and link to
superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we report a resonant x-ray scattering
measurement of the charge order in infinite-layer PrNiO2. By measuring the
scattering intensity versus azimuthal angles, we resolve the intra-unit-cell
symmetry of the charge order and discover that it has predominant d-wave
orbital symmetry, strikingly resembling lightly doped cuprates. Our results
shed new light on the nature of charge order in infinite-layer nickelates and
may assist in establishing a common thread to understanding the role of charge
order in infinite-layer nickelates and cuprates.

					<dc:description>  Light-driven matter can exhibit qualitatively distinct electronic and optical
properties from those observed at equilibrium. We introduce generalized sum
rules for the optical properties of driven systems by both quantum and
classical light. For classical light, it shows that the sum of all Fourier
components, indexed by n, of the time-dependent dipole matrix elements between
dressed states weighted by the corresponding quasienergy difference in the
first Floquet Brillouin zone plus n driving frequency is a constant, determined
by the number of electrons. An analogous sum rule for quantum light-dressing is
also derived. These developments provide guidance for the control of effective
optical properties of matter by light fields.

					<dc:description>  Salient object detection in optical remote sensing image (ORSI-SOD) has
gradually attracted attention thanks to the development of deep learning (DL)
and salient object detection in natural scene image (NSI-SOD). However, NSI and
ORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background,
and large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated
method is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay
sufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the
final saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose
a novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware
Auxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary
Protection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge
position information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level
features. Second, a Dual Feature Feedback Complementary (DFFC) module is
proposed based on BPC module. It aggregates boundary-semantic dual features and
provides effective feedback to coordinate features across different layers.
Finally, a Strong Semantic Feedback Refinement (SSFR) module is proposed to
obtain more complete saliency maps. This module further refines feature
representation and eliminates feature differences through a unique feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that DFA-BASO
outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this paper strongly
demonstrates the true contribution of DFA-BASO to ORSI-SOD by in-depth analysis
of the visualization figure. All codes can be found at
https://github.com/YUHsss/DFA-BASO.

					<dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented achievements of large-scale
pre-trained models, especially the Transformer models. Many products and
services in Tencent Inc., such as WeChat, QQ, and Tencent Advertisement, have
been opted in to gain the power of pre-trained models. In this work, we present
Angel-PTM, a productive deep learning system designed for pre-training and
fine-tuning Transformer models. Angel-PTM can train extremely large-scale
models with hierarchical memory efficiently. The key designs of Angel-PTM are
the fine-grained memory management via the Page abstraction and a unified
scheduling method that coordinate the computations, data movements, and
communications. Furthermore, Angel-PTM supports extreme model scaling with SSD
storage and implements the lock-free updating mechanism to address the SSD I/O
bandwidth bottlenecks. Experimental results demonstrate that Angel-PTM
outperforms existing systems by up to 114.8% in terms of maximum model scale as
well as up to 88.9% in terms of training throughput. Additionally, experiments
on GPT3-175B and T5-MoE-1.2T models utilizing hundreds of GPUs verify the
strong scalability of Angel-PTM.

					<dc:description>  Border security had been a persistent problem in international border
especially when it get to the issue of preventing illegal movement of weapons,
contraband, drugs, and combating issue of illegal or undocumented immigrant
while at the same time ensuring that lawful trade, economic prosperity coupled
with national sovereignty across the border is maintained. In this research
work, we used open source computer vision (Open CV) and adaboost algorithm to
develop a model which can detect a moving object a far off, classify it,
automatically snap full image and face of the individual separately, and then
run a background check on them against worldwide databases while making a
prediction about an individual being a potential threat, intending immigrant,
potential terrorists or extremist and then raise sound alarm. Our model can be
deployed on any camera device and be mounted at any international border. There
are two stages involved, we first developed a model based on open CV computer
vision algorithm, with the ability to detect human movement from afar, it will
automatically snap both the face and the full image of the person separately,
and the second stage is the automatic triggering of background check against
the moving object. This ensures it check the moving object against several
databases worldwide and is able to determine the admissibility of the person
afar off. If the individual is inadmissible, it will automatically alert the
border officials with the image of the person and other details, and if the
bypass the border officials, the system is able to detect and alert the
authority with his images and other details. All these operations will be done
afar off by the AI powered camera before the individual reach the border

					<dc:description>  We develop the BRST-BV approach to construct the general off-shell Lorentz
covariant cubic, quartic, $e$-tic interaction vertices for irreducible higher
spin fields on $d$-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider two different cases
for interacting integer higher spin fields both with massless and with massive
fields. The deformation procedure to find minimal (determined with help of
generalized Hilbert space) BRST-BV action for interacting higher spin fields is
based on the preservation of master equation validity in each power of coupling
constant $g$ starting from the Lagrangian formulation for free gauge theory. As
examples we consider the construction of local cubic vertices for $k$
irreducible massless fields of integer helicities, and $k-1$ massless with one
massive fields of spins $s_1, ,..., s_{k-1}, s_k$. For triple of two massless
scalars and tensor field of integer spin the BRST-BV action with cubic
interaction is explicitly found. Unlike the previous results on cubic vertices
we follow our result for BRST approach [arXiv:2105.12030[hep-th]] for massless
fields, but for the unique BRST-BV action instead of classical action with
reducible gauge transformations. The procedure is based on the complete BRST
operator, including the trace constraints that is used to formulate an
irreducible representation with definite integer spin.

					<dc:description>  Robot manipulation tasks by natural language instructions need common
understanding of the target object between human and the robot. However, the
instructions often have an interpretation ambiguity, because the instruction
lacks important information, or does not express the target object correctly to
complete the task. To solve this ambiguity problem, we hypothesize that
&quot;naming&quot; the target objects in advance will reduce the ambiguity of natural
language instructions. We propose a robot system and method that incorporates
naming with appearance of the objects in advance, so that in the later
manipulation task, instruction can be performed with its unique name to
disambiguate the objects easily. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, we build a system that can memorize the target objects, and show that
naming the objects facilitates detection of the target objects and improves the
success rate of manipulation instructions. With this method, the success rate
of object manipulation task increases by 31% in ambiguous instructions.

					<dc:title>On computing sets of integers with maximum number of pairs summing to

					<dc:description>  We address the problem of finding sets of integers of a given size with
maximum number of pairs summing to powers of $2$. By fixing particular pairs
this problem reduces to finding a labeling of the vertices of a given graph
with pairwise distinct integers such that the endpoint labels for each edge sum
to a power of $2$. We propose an efficient algorithm for this problem, which we
use to determine the maximum size of graphs of order $n$ that admit such a
labeling for all $n\leq 18$. We also identify the minimal forbidden subgraphs
of order $\leq 11$, whose presence prevents graphs from having such a labeling.

					<dc:description>  In this research, we focus on the usage of adversarial sampling to test for
the fairness in the prediction of deep neural network model across different
classes of image in a given dataset. While several framework had been proposed
to ensure robustness of machine learning model against adversarial attack, some
of which includes adversarial training algorithm. There is still the pitfall
that adversarial training algorithm tends to cause disparity in accuracy and
robustness among different group. Our research is aimed at using adversarial
sampling to test for fairness in the prediction of deep neural network model
across different classes or categories of image in a given dataset. We
successfully demonstrated a new method of ensuring fairness across various
group of input in deep neural network classifier. We trained our neural network
model on the original image, and without training our model on the perturbed or
attacked image. When we feed the adversarial samplings to our model, it was
able to predict the original category/ class of the image the adversarial
sample belongs to. We also introduced and used the separation of concern
concept from software engineering whereby there is an additional standalone
filter layer that filters perturbed image by heavily removing the noise or
attack before automatically passing it to the network for classification, we
were able to have accuracy of 93.3%. Cifar-10 dataset have ten categories of
dataset, and so, in order to account for fairness, we applied our hypothesis
across each categories of dataset and were able to get a consistent result and
accuracy.

					<dc:description>  Attaining the equilibrium state of a catalyst-adsorbate system is key to
fundamentally assessing its effective properties, such as adsorption energy.
Machine learning methods with finer supervision strategies have been applied to
boost and guide the relaxation process of an atomic system and better predict
its properties at the equilibrium state. In this paper, we present a novel
graph neural network (GNN) supervision and prediction strategy DR-Label. The
method enhances the supervision signal, reduces the multiplicity of solutions
in edge representation, and encourages the model to provide node predictions
that are graph structural variation robust. DR-Label first Deconstructs
finer-grained equilibrium state information to the model by projecting the
node-level supervision signal to each edge. Reversely, the model Reconstructs a
more robust equilibrium state prediction by transforming edge-level predictions
to node-level with a sphere-fitting algorithm. The DR-Label strategy was
applied to three radically distinct models, each of which displayed consistent
performance enhancements. Based on the DR-Label strategy, we further proposed
DRFormer, which achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the Open
Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset and the Cu-based single-atom-alloyed CO adsorption
(SAA) dataset. We expect that our work will highlight crucial steps for the
development of a more accurate model in equilibrium state property prediction
of a catalysis system.

					<dc:description>  Topological magnetic textures observed in experiments can, in principle, be
predicted by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations. However, such
calculations are, in general, hampered by difficulties in distinguishing
between local and global energy minima. This becomes particularly problematic
for magnetic materials that allow for a multitude of topological charges.
Finding solutions to such problems by means of classical numerical methods can
be challenging because either a good initial guess or a gigantic amount of
random sampling is required. In this study, we demonstrate an efficient way to
identify those metastable configurations by leveraging the power of gradient
descent-based optimization within the framework of a feedforward neural network
combined with a heuristic meta-search, which is driven by a random perturbation
of the neural network's input. We exemplify the power of the method by an
analysis of the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system, an experimentally well characterized
system.

					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work, we investigate the relationship between the geometrical
properties, the photon sphere, the shadow, and the eikonal quasinormal modes of
electrically charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
Quasinormal modes are complex frequency oscillations that are dependent on the
geometry of spacetime and have significant applications in studying black hole
properties and testing alternative theories of gravity. Here, we focus on the
eikonal limit for high frequency quasinormal modes and their connection to the
black holes geometric characteristics. To study the photon sphere, quasinormal
modes, and black hole shadow, we employ various techniques such as the WKB
method in various orders of approximation, the Poschl-Teller potential method,
and Churilova's analytical formulas. Our results indicate that the real part of
the eikonal quasinormal mode frequencies of test fields are linked to the
unstable circular null geodesic and are correlated with the shadow radius for
an Charged Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet 4D black hole. Furthermore, we found that the
real part of quasinormal modes, the photon sphere and shadow radius have a
lower value for charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
compared to black holes without electric charge and those of static black holes
in general relativity. Additionally, we explore various analytical formulas for
the photon spheres and shadows, deducing an Churilova's approximate formula for
the black hole shadow radius of the Charged Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet 4D black
hole, which arises from its connection with the eikonal quasinormal modes.

					<dc:description>  Magnetism is a ubiquitous property of astrophysical plasmas, yet stellar
magnetism still remains far from being completely understood. In this review,
we describe recent observational and modelling efforts and progress to expand
our knowledge of the magnetic properties of high-mass stars. Several mechanisms
(magneto-convection, mass-loss quenching, internal angular momentum transport,
and magnetic braking) have significant implications for stellar evolution,
populations, and end-products. Consequently, it remains an urgent issue to
address and resolve open questions related to magnetism in high-mass stars.

					<dc:description>  With the recent advances in hardware and rendering techniques, 3D models have
emerged everywhere in our life. Yet creating 3D shapes is arduous and requires
significant professional knowledge. Meanwhile, Deep learning has enabled
high-quality 3D shape reconstruction from various sources, making it a viable
approach to acquiring 3D shapes with minimal effort. Importantly, to be used in
common 3D applications, the reconstructed shapes need to be represented as
polygonal meshes, which is a challenge for neural networks due to the
irregularity of mesh tessellations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of mesh reconstruction methods that are powered by machine learning. We
first describe various representations for 3D shapes in the deep learning
context. Then we review the development of 3D mesh reconstruction methods from
voxels, point clouds, single images, and multi-view images. Finally, we
identify several challenges in this field and propose potential future
directions.

					<dc:description>  Through advancement of the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network, road safety,
energy consumption, and traffic efficiency can be significantly improved. An
accurate vehicle trajectory prediction benefits communication traffic
management and network resource allocation for the real-time application of the
V2X network. Recurrent neural networks and their variants have been reported in
recent research to predict vehicle mobility. However, the spatial attribute of
vehicle movement behavior has been overlooked, resulting in incomplete
information utilization. To bridge this gap, we put forward for the first time
a hierarchical trajectory prediction structure using the capsule neural network
(CapsNet) with three sequential components. First, the geographic information
is transformed into a grid map presentation, describing vehicle mobility
distribution spatially and temporally. Second, CapsNet serves as the core model
to embed local temporal and global spatial correlation through hierarchical
capsules. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on actual taxi mobility data
collected in Porto city (Portugal) and Singapore show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

					<dc:description>  How to aggregate spatial information plays an essential role in
learning-based image restoration. Most existing CNN-based networks adopt static
convolutional kernels to encode spatial information, which cannot aggregate
spatial information adaptively. Recent transformer-based architectures achieve
adaptive spatial aggregation. But they lack desirable inductive biases of
convolutions and require heavy computational costs. In this paper, we propose a
kernel basis attention (KBA) module, which introduces learnable kernel bases to
model representative image patterns for spatial information aggregation.
Different kernel bases are trained to model different local structures. At each
spatial location, they are linearly and adaptively fused by predicted
pixel-wise coefficients to obtain aggregation weights. Based on the KBA module,
we further design a multi-axis feature fusion (MFF) block to encode and fuse
channel-wise, spatial-invariant, and pixel-adaptive features for image
restoration. Our model, named kernel basis network (KBNet), achieves
state-of-the-art performances on more than ten benchmarks over image denoising,
deraining, and deblurring tasks while requiring less computational cost than
previous SOTA methods.

					<dc:description>  Phase engineering by strains in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for
a variety of applications. Here, we present a study of strain induced
ferroelectric (FE) transition on bismuth oxyselenide (Bi$_2$O$_2$Se) films, a
high-performance (HP) semiconductor for next-generation electronics.
Bi$_2$O$_2$Se is non-FE at ambient. Upon a loading force $\gtrsim 400$ nN,
piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops on magnitude and
180$^\textrm{o}$ phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors,
these features are attributed to a transition to FE phase. The transition is
further proved by the appearance of a sharp peak on optical second harmonic
generation under an uniaxial strain. Fundamentally, solids with paraelectric at
ambient and FE under strains are scarce. FE transition is discussed with the
help of first-principle calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching
of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts

work endows a new degree of freedom to a HP electronic/optoelectronic

					<dc:description>  We consider finding a counterfactual explanation for a classification or
regression forest, such as a random forest. This requires solving an
optimization problem to find the closest input instance to a given instance for
which the forest outputs a desired value. Finding an exact solution has a cost
that is exponential on the number of leaves in the forest. We propose a simple
but very effective approach: we constrain the optimization to only those input
space regions defined by the forest that are populated by actual data points.
The problem reduces to a form of nearest-neighbor search using a certain
distance on a certain dataset. This has two advantages: first, the solution can
be found very quickly, scaling to large forests and high-dimensional data, and
enabling interactive use. Second, the solution found is more likely to be
realistic in that it is guided towards high-density areas of input space.

					<dc:description>  Machine learning practitioners often end up tunneling on low-level technical
details like model architectures and performance metrics. Could early model
development instead focus on high-level questions of which factors a model
ought to pay attention to? Inspired by the practice of sketching in design,
which distills ideas to their minimal representation, we introduce model
sketching: a technical framework for iteratively and rapidly authoring
functional approximations of a machine learning model's decision-making logic.
Model sketching refocuses practitioner attention on composing high-level,
human-understandable concepts that the model is expected to reason over (e.g.,
profanity, racism, or sarcasm in a content moderation task) using zero-shot
concept instantiation. In an evaluation with 17 ML practitioners, model
sketching reframed thinking from implementation to higher-level exploration,
prompted iteration on a broader range of model designs, and helped identify
gaps in the problem formulation$\unicode{x2014}$all in a fraction of the time
ordinarily required to build a model.

					<dc:title>Improving Transformer-based Image Matching by Cascaded Capturing
  Spatially Informative Keypoints</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Cao, Chenjie</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Learning robust local image feature matching is a fundamental low-level
vision task, which has been widely explored in the past few years. Recently,
detector-free local feature matchers based on transformers have shown promising
results, which largely outperform pure Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
ones. But correlations produced by transformer-based methods are spatially
limited to the center of source views' coarse patches, because of the costly
attention learning. In this work, we rethink this issue and find that such
matching formulation degrades pose estimation, especially for low-resolution
images. So we propose a transformer-based cascade matching model -- Cascade
feature Matching TRansformer (CasMTR), to efficiently learn dense feature
correlations, which allows us to choose more reliable matching pairs for the
relative pose estimation. Instead of re-training a new detector, we use a
simple yet effective Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-process to filter
keypoints through the confidence map, and largely improve the matching
precision. CasMTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor and outdoor
pose estimation as well as visual localization. Moreover, thorough ablations
show the efficacy of the proposed components and techniques.

					<dc:description>  Silicon Carbide (SiC) ceramic matrix composite (CMC) cladding is currently
being pursued as one of the leading candidates for accident-tolerant fuels. To
enable an improved understanding of SiC-SiC composite performance, the
development of non-destructive evaluation techniques to assess critical defects
is needed. Three-dimensional (3D) X-ray imaging, also referred to as X-ray
computed tomography (CT), is a non-destructive, data-rich characterization
technique that can provide surface and subsurface spatial information. This
paper discusses the design and implementation of a fully automatic workflow to
detect and analyze SiC-SiC defects using image processing techniques on 3D
X-ray images. The workflow consists of four processing blocks, including data
preparation, void/crack detection, visualization, and analysis. In this work,
three SiC samples (two irradiated and one unirradiated) provided by General
Atomics are investigated. The irradiated samples were exposed in a way that was
expected to induce cracking, and indeed, the automated workflow developed in
this work was able to successfully identify and characterize the crack
formation in the irradiated samples while detecting no observed cracking in the
unirradiated sample. These results demonstrate the value of automated XCT tools
to better understand the damage and damage propagation in SiC-SiC structures
for nuclear applications.

					<dc:description>  We study multiple testing in the normal means problem with estimated
variances that are shrunk through empirical Bayes methods. The situation is
asymmetric in that a prior is posited for the nuisance parameters (variances)
but not the primary parameters (means). If the prior were known, one could
proceed by computing p-values conditional on sample variances; a strategy
called partially Bayes inference by Sir David Cox. These conditional p-values
satisfy a Tweedie-type formula and are approximated at nearly-parametric rates
when the prior is estimated by nonparametric maximum likelihood. If the
variances are in fact fixed, the approach retains type-I error guarantees.

					<dc:description>  This paper develops optimal beamforming design in a downlink
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system
to maximize the weighted sum-rate of communicating users under the prescribed
transmit covariance constraint for radar performance guarantee. In single-user
case, we show that the transmit covariance constraint implies inherent
orthogonality among beamforming vectors in use. Then leveraging a corollary of
Cauchy's interlace theorem, we derive the globally optimal beamforming solution
in closed form. For multi-user case, we exploit the connection between weighted
sum-rate and weighted minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) to reformulate the
problem, and develop a block-coordinate-descent (BCD) type algorithm with
closed-form solution derived for the subproblem in each step and fast
convergence to a locally optimal beamforming design. Numerical results validate
the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.

					<dc:description>  Whilst the partial differential equations that govern the dynamics of our
world have been studied in great depth for centuries, solving them for complex,
high-dimensional conditions and domains still presents an incredibly large
mathematical and computational challenge. Analytical methods can be cumbersome
to utilise, and numerical methods can lead to errors and inaccuracies. On top
of this, sometimes we lack the information or knowledge to pose the problem
well enough to apply these kinds of methods. Here, we present a new approach to
approximating the solution to physical systems - physics-informed neural
networks. The concept of artificial neural networks is introduced, the
objective function is defined, and optimisation strategies are discussed. The
partial differential equation is then included as a constraint in the loss
function for the optimisation problem, giving the network access to knowledge
of the dynamics of the physical system it is modelling. Some intuitive examples
are displayed, and more complex applications are considered to showcase the
power of physics informed neural networks, such as in seismic imaging. Solution
error is analysed, and suggestions are made to improve convergence and/or
solution precision. Problems and limitations are also touched upon in the
conclusions, as well as some thoughts as to where physics informed neural
networks are most useful, and where they could go next.

					<dc:title>Perspectives on the Social Impacts of Reinforcement Learning with Human
  Feedback</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Is it possible for machines to think like humans? And if it is, how should we
go about teaching them to do so? As early as 1950, Alan Turing stated that we
ought to teach machines in the way of teaching a child. Reinforcement learning
with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong candidate toward allowing
agents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic manner. RLHF is distinct
from traditional reinforcement learning as it provides feedback from a human
teacher in addition to a reward signal. It has been catapulted into public view
by multiple high-profile AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT,
DeepMind's Sparrow, and Anthropic's Claude. These highly capable chatbots are
already overturning our understanding of how AI interacts with humanity. The
wide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate the need to
evaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this paper
considers an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without
negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide
a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and
ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders.
Although text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is
crucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range
of areas to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which
RLHF-based technologies will affect society by positively transforming human
experiences with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to
net positively impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI
access, cross-cultural dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises
concerns that echo those of existing AI technologies, it will be important for
all to be aware and intentional in the adoption of RLHF.

					<dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper aims to construct a valid and efficient confidence interval for
the extrema of parameters under privacy protection. The usual statistical
inference on the extrema of parameters often suffers from the selection bias
issue, and the problem becomes more acute, as in many application scenarios of
extrema parameters, we often need to protect the privacy of the data. In this
paper, we focus on the exponential family of distributions and propose a
privatized parametric bootstrap method to address selection bias in the extrema
of parameters problem under the scheme of differential privacy. While the usual
privatized parametric bootstrap does not address selection bias appropriately,
we prove that with a privatized bias correction term, the proposed parametric
bootstrap method can lead to a valid and efficient confidence interval for the
extrema of parameters. We illustrate the proposed method with the Gaussian case
and regression case and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method via
numerical experiments.

					<dc:description>  Autonomous lander missions on extraterrestrial bodies will need to sample
granular material while coping with domain shift, no matter how well a sampling
strategy is tuned on Earth. This paper proposes an adaptive scooping strategy
that uses deep Gaussian process method trained with meta-learning to learn
on-line from very limited experience on the target terrains. It introduces a
novel meta-training approach, Deep Meta-Learning with Controlled Deployment
Gaps (CoDeGa), that explicitly trains the deep kernel to predict scooping
volume robustly under large domain shifts. Employed in a Bayesian Optimization
sequential decision-making framework, the proposed method allows the robot to
use vision and very little on-line experience to achieve high-quality scooping
actions on out-of-distribution terrains, significantly outperforming
non-adaptive methods proposed in the excavation literature as well as other
state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. Moreover, a dataset of 6,700 executed
scoops collected on a diverse set of materials, terrain topography, and
compositions is made available for future research in granular material
manipulation and meta-learning.

					<dc:description>  We propose a holistic methodology for designing automotivesystems that
consider security a central concern at every design stage.During the concept
design, we model the system architecture and definethe security attributes of
its components. We perform threat analysis onthe system model to identify
structural security issues. From that analysis,we derive attack trees that
define recipes describing steps to successfullyattack the system's assets and
propose threat prevention measures.The attack tree allows us to derive a
verification and validation (V&amp;V)plan, which prioritizes the testing effort. In
particular, we advocate usinglearning for testing approaches for the black-box
components. It consistsof inferring a finite state model of the black-box
component from its executiontraces. This model can then be used to generate new
relevanttests, model check it against requirements, and compare two
differentimplementations of the same protocol. We illustrate the
methodologywith an automotive infotainment system example. Using the advocated
approach, we could also document unexpected and potentially criticalbehavior in
our example systems.

					<dc:description>  We report on a study of the Multiview Observatory for Solar Terrestrial
Science (MOST) mission that will provide comprehensive imagery and time series
data needed to understand the magnetic connection between the solar interior
and the solar atmosphere/inner heliosphere. MOST will build upon the successes
of SOHO and STEREO missions with new views of the Sun and enhanced instrument
capabilities. This article is based on a study conducted at NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center that determined the required instrument refinement, spacecraft
accommodation, launch configuration, and flight dynamics for mission success.
MOST is envisioned as the next generation great observatory positioned to
obtain three-dimensional information of solar wind structures such as coronal
mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and the solar wind. The MOST
mission consists of 2 pairs of spacecraft located in the vicinity of Sun Earth
Lagrange points L4 (MOST1, MOST3) and L5 (MOST2 and MOST4). The spacecraft
stationed at L4 (MOST1) and L5 (MOST2) will each carry seven remote-sensing and
three in-situ instrument suites. MOST will also carry a novel radio package
known as the Faraday Effect Tracker of Coronal and Heliospheric structures
(FETCH). FETCH will have polarized radio transmitters and receivers on all four
spacecraft to measure the magnetic content of solar wind structures propagating
from the Sun to Earth using the Faraday rotation technique. The MOST mission
will be able to sample the magnetized plasma throughout the Sun Earth connected
space during the mission lifetime over a solar cycle.

					<dc:description>  It is an important task to model realized volatilities for high-frequency
data in finance and economics and, as arguably the most popular model, the
heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model has dominated the applications in this
area. However, this model suffers from three drawbacks: (i.) its heterogeneous
volatility components are linear combinations of daily realized volatilities
with fixed weights, which limit its flexibility for different types of assets,
(ii.) it is still unknown what is the high-frequency probabilistic structure
for this model, as well as many other HAR-type models in the literature, and
(iii.) there is no high-dimensional inference tool for HAR modeling although it
is common to encounter many assets in real applications. To overcome these
drawbacks, this paper proposes a multilinear low-rank HAR model by using tensor
techniques, where a data-driven method is adopted to automatically select the
heterogeneous components. In addition, HAR-It\^o models are introduced to
interpret the corresponding high-frequency dynamics, as well as those of other
HAR-type models. Moreover, non-asymptotic properties of the high-dimensional
HAR modeling are established, and a projected gradient descent algorithm with
theoretical justifications is suggested to search for estimates. Theoretical
and computational properties of the proposed method are verified by simulation
studies, and the necessity of using the data-driven method for heterogeneous
components is illustrated in real data analysis.

					<dc:title>Stabilizing the Maximal Entropy Moment Method for Rarefied Gas Dynamics

					<dc:description>  Developing extended hydrodynamics equations valid for both dense and rarefied
gases remains a great challenge. A systematical solution for this challenge is
the moment method describing both dense and rarefied gas behaviors with moments
of gas molecule velocity distributions. Among moment methods, the maximal
entropy moment method (MEM) stands out for its well-posedness and stability,
which utilizes velocity distributions with maximized entropy. However, finding
such distributions requires solving an ill-conditioned and
computation-demanding optimization problem. This problem causes numerical
overflow and breakdown when the numerical precision is insufficient, especially
for flows like high-speed shock waves. It also prevents modern GPUs from
accelerating optimization with their enormous single floating-point precision
computation power. This paper aims to stabilize MEM, making it practical for
simulating very strong normal shock waves on modern GPUs at single precision.
We propose the gauge transformations for MEM, making the optimization less
ill-conditioned. We also tackle numerical overflow and breakdown by adopting
the canonical form of distribution and Newton's modified optimization method.
With these techniques, we achieved a single-precision GPU simulation of a Mach
10 shock wave with 35 moments MEM, surpassing the previous double-precision
results of Mach 4. Moreover, we argued that over-refined spatial mesh degrades
both the accuracy and stability of MEM. Overall, this paper makes the maximal
entropy moment method practical for simulating very strong normal shock waves
on modern GPUs at single-precision, with significant stability improvement
compared to previous methods.

					<dc:description>  A distributed quantum computing system requires a quantum communication
channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting
circuits, such a channel can be realized by using propagating microwave photons
to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver
node. Here we experimentally demonstrate a superconducting circuit that
deterministically transfers the state of a data qubit into a propagating
microwave mode, with a process fidelity of 94.5%. We use a time-varying
parametric drive to shape the temporal profile of the propagating mode to be
time-symmetric and with constant phase, so that reabsorption by the receiving
processor can be implemented as a time-reversed version of the emission. We
demonstrate a self-calibrating routine to correct for time-dependent shifts of
the emitted frequencies due to the modulation of the parametric drive. Our work
provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer
and remote entanglement operations in a distributed quantum computing network.

					<dc:description>  Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the algorithmic estimation of
stochastic entropy production (EP) from the trajectory data via machine
learning. A crucial element of such algorithms is the identification of a loss
function whose minimization guarantees the accurate EP estimation. In this
study, we show that there exists a host of loss functions, namely those
implementing a variational representation of the $\alpha$-divergence, which can
be used for the EP estimation. Among these loss functions, the one
corresponding to $\alpha = -0.5$ exhibits the most robust performance against
strong nonequilibrium driving or slow dynamics, which adversely affects the
existing method based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($\alpha = 0$). To
corroborate our findings, we present an exactly solvable simplification of the
EP estimation problem, whose loss function landscape and stochastic properties
demonstrate the optimality of $\alpha = -0.5$.

					<dc:title>A Topological Distance Measure between Multi-Fields for Classification
  and Analysis of Shapes and Data</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  Distance measures play an important role in shape classification and data
analysis problems. Topological distances based on Reeb graphs and persistence
diagrams have been employed to obtain effective algorithms in shape matching
and scalar data analysis. In the current paper, we propose an improved distance
measure between two multi-fields by computing a multi-dimensional Reeb graph
(MDRG) each of which captures the topology of a multi-field through a hierarchy
of Reeb graphs in different dimensions. A hierarchy of persistence diagrams is
then constructed by computing a persistence diagram corresponding to each Reeb
graph of the MDRG. Based on this representation, we propose a novel distance
measure between two MDRGs by extending the bottleneck distance between two Reeb
graphs. We show that the proposed measure satisfies the pseudo-metric and
stability properties. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed multi-field
topology-based measure on two different applications: (1) shape classification
and (2) detection of topological features in a time-varying multi-field data.
In the shape classification problem, the performance of the proposed measure is
compared with the well-known topology-based measures in shape matching. In the
second application, we consider a time-varying volumetric multi-field data from
the field of computational chemistry where the goal is to detect the site of
stable bond formation between Pt and CO molecules. We demonstrate the ability
of the proposed distance in classifying each of the sites as occurring before
and after the bond stabilization.

					<dc:description>  Integrated quantum photonics (IQP) provides a path to practical, scalable
quantum computation, communications and information processing. Realization of
an IQP platform requires integration of quantum emitters with high quality
photonic circuits. However, the range of materials for monolithic platforms is
limited by the simultaneous need for a high-quality single photon source, high
optical performance and availability of scalable nanofabrication techniques.
Here we demonstrate the fabrication of IQP components from the recently emerged
quantum material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), including tapered waveguides,
microdisks, and 1D and 2D photonic crystal cavities. Resonators with quality
factors greater than 4000 are achieved, and we engineer proof-of-principle
complex, free-standing IQP circuitry fabricated from single crystal hBN. Our
results show the potential of hBN for scalable integrated quantum technologies.

					<dc:description>  Robots that work close to humans need to understand and use social cues to
act in a socially acceptable manner. Social cues are a form of communication
(i.e., information flow) between people. In this paper, a framework is
introduced to detect and analyse social cues and information transfer
directionality using an information-theoretic measure, namely, transfer
entropy. We demonstrate the framework in three settings involving social
interactions between humans: object-handover, group-joining and
person-following. Results show that transfer entropy can identify information
flows between agents, when and where they occur, and their relative strength.
For instance, in a person-following scenario, we find that head orientation of
a predictor is particularly informative, and the different times and locations
that this is used to convey information to a leader influences their behaviour.
Potential applications of the framework include information flow or social cue
analysis for interactive robot design, or socially-aware robot planning.

					<dc:description>  For grasp network algorithms, generating grasp datasets for a large number of
3D objects is a crucial task. However, generating grasp datasets for hundreds
of objects can be very slow and consume a lot of storage resources, which
hinders algorithm iteration and promotion. For point cloud grasp network
algorithms, the network input is essentially the internal point cloud of the
grasp area that intersects with the object in the gripper coordinate system.
Due to the existence of a large number of completely consistent gripper area
point clouds based on the gripper coordinate system in the grasp dataset
generated for hundreds of objects, it is possible to remove the consistent
gripper area point clouds from many objects and assemble them into a single
object to generate the grasp dataset, thus replacing the enormous workload of
generating grasp datasets for hundreds of objects. We propose a new approach to
map the repetitive features of a large number of objects onto a finite set.To
this end, we propose a method for extracting the gripper area point cloud that
intersects with the object from the simulator and design a gripper feature
filter to remove the shape-repeated gripper space area point clouds, and then
assemble them into a single object. The experimental results show that the time
required to generate the new object grasp dataset is greatly reduced compared
to generating the grasp dataset for hundreds of objects, and it performs well
in real machine grasping experiments. We will release the data and tools after
the paper is accepted.

					<dc:description>  Video generation has achieved rapid progress benefiting from high-quality
renderings provided by powerful image generators. We regard the video synthesis
task as generating a sequence of images sharing the same contents but varying
in motions. However, most previous video synthesis frameworks based on
pre-trained image generators treat content and motion generation separately,
leading to unrealistic generated videos. Therefore, we design a novel framework
to build the motion space, aiming to achieve content consistency and fast
convergence for video generation. We present MotionVideoGAN, a novel video
generator synthesizing videos based on the motion space learned by pre-trained
image pair generators. Firstly, we propose an image pair generator named
MotionStyleGAN to generate image pairs sharing the same contents and producing
various motions. Then we manage to acquire motion codes to edit one image in
the generated image pairs and keep the other unchanged. The motion codes help
us edit images within the motion space since the edited image shares the same
contents with the other unchanged one in image pairs. Finally, we introduce a
latent code generator to produce latent code sequences using motion codes for
video generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
most complex video dataset ever used for unconditional video generation
evaluation, UCF101.

					<dc:description>  We study the Hartree equation describing the time evolution of the wave
functions of infinitely many fermions interacting with each other. The Hartree
equation can be formulated in terms of random field. This formulation was
introduced by de Suzzoni in [arXiv:1507.06180]. It has infinitely many steady
states, and [arXiv:1811.03150, arXiv:2007.00472] have studied its asymptotic
stability. However, they required somewhat strong conditions for steady states,
and the stability of Fermi gas at zero temperature, one of the most important
steady states from the physics point of view, was left open. In this paper, we
prove the stability of steady states in a wide class, which includes Fermi gas
at zero temperature in $d$-dimensional space when $d \ge 3$. Moreover, in the
previous studies, the norms of the scattering are strictly weaker than the
norms of the initial data. In this paper, we prove that we can match them if we
assume some strong conditions for potential function.

					<dc:description>  We report the discovery of structural phase transitions and superconductivity
in the full Heusler compounds $X$Pd$_2$Sn ($X$ = Ti, Zr, Hf), by means of
electrical transport, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and x-ray
diffraction measurements. TiPd$_2$Sn, ZrPd$_2$Sn and HfPd$_2$Sn undergo
structural phase transitions from the room-temperature cubic MnCu$_2$Al-type
structure (space group $Fm\bar{3}m$) to a low-temperature tetragonal structure
at around 160 K, 110 K and 90 K, respectively, which are likely related charge
density wave (CDW) instabilities. Low temperature single crystal x-ray
diffraction measurements of ZrPd$_2$Sn demonstrate the emergence of a
superstructure with multiple commensurate modulations below $T_s$. ZrPd$_2$Sn
and HfPd$_2$Sn have bulk superconductivity (SC) with transition temperatures
$T_c$ $\sim$ 1.2 K and 1.3 K, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations reveal evidence for structural and electronic instabilities which
can give rise to CDW formation, suggesting that these $X$Pd$_2$Sn systems are
good candidates for examining the interplay between CDW and SC.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It has been demonstrated that prompt tuning is highly effective in
efficiently eliciting knowledge from language models (LMs). However, the prompt
tuning still lags behind fine-tuning, especially when the LMs are small.
P-tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2021b) makes it comparable with finetuning by adding
continuous prompts for every layer of the pre-trained model. However,
prepending fixed soft prompts for all instances, regardless of their
discrepancy, is doubtful. In particular, the inserted prompt position, length,
and the representations of prompts for diversified instances through different
tasks could all affect the prompt tuning performance. To fill this gap, we
propose dynamic prompting (DP): the position, length, and prompt representation
can all be dynamically optimized with respect to different tasks and instances.
We conduct comprehensive experiments on the SuperGlue benchmark to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate substantial improvements. We also derive a unified
framework for supporting our dynamic prompting strategy. In particular, we use
a simple learning network and Gumble- Softmax for learning instance-dependent
guidance. Experimental results show that simple instance-level position-aware
soft prompts can improve the classification accuracy of up to 6 points on
average on five datasets, reducing its gap with fine-tuning. Besides, we also
prove its universal usefulness under full-data, few-shot, and multitask
regimes. Combining them together can even further unleash the power of DP,
narrowing the distance between finetuning.

					<dc:description>  The solid solution 122 compounds, Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2}$P$_{2}$, show
valence transition between divalent state and intermediate valence states at
Eu, which is firmly correlated to multiple degrees of freedom in the solid such
as the isostructural transition between the collapsed tetragonal (cT) and
uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) structures, $3d$ magnetism, and the formation of
P-P dimers. To gain insights into the correlated behavior, we investigate the
effect of high magnetic fields on the samples of $x = 0.4$ and $0.5$ using
magnetostriction and magnetization measurements up to 60 T. The samples are in
the Eu valence fluctuating regime, where the possible structural transition
from cT to ucT may be induced by the Eu valence change under the magnetic
fields. For both samples, magnetostriction smoothly increases with increasing
magnetic fields. The behavior is in good agreement with the calculated results
using the interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model that describes the
valence change. This indicates that $\Delta L$ represents the change of the Eu
valence state in these compounds. Magnetization curves for both compounds show
good agreement with the ICF model at high magnetic fields. In contrast, in the
low magnetic field region, magnetization curves do not agree with the ICF
model. These results indicate that the Eu valence changes manifest themselves
in the magnetization curves at high magnetic fields and that the magnetism of
the $3d$ electrons manifests itself in the magnetization at low magnetic
fields. Hence, we conclude that the valence change occurs within the Eu valence
fluctuation regime coupled with the cT structure. Thereby, we believe that the
transition to ucT structure which is firmly coupled with the divalent Eu state
does not occur within the magnetic field range of the present study.

next-generation neutrino telescope. In September 2021, the TRIDENT pathfinder
experiment (TRIDENT EXplorer, T-REX for short) completed in-situ measurements
of deep-sea water properties in the South China Sea. The T-REX apparatus
integrates two independent and complementary systems, a photomultiplier tube
(PMT) and a camera system, to measure the optical and radioactive properties of
the deep-sea water. One light emitter module and two light receiver modules
were deployed, which were synchronized by using White Rabbit (WR) technology.
The light emitter module generates nanosecond-width LED pulses, while the light
receiver module hosts three PMTs and a camera to detect photons. The submerged
apparatus and the data acquisition system (DAQ) perform real-time command and
data transmission. We report the design and performance of the readout
electronics for T-REX, including hardware modules, firmware design for digital
signal processing, and host-computer software.

					<dc:description>  In recent years, In-context Learning (ICL) has gained increasing attention
and emerged as the new paradigm for large language model (LLM) evaluation.
Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, ICL instead adapts the pre-trained
models to unseen tasks without any parameter updates. However, the
implementation of ICL is sophisticated due to the diverse retrieval and
inference methods involved, as well as the varying pre-processing requirements
for different models, datasets, and tasks. A unified and flexible framework for
ICL is urgently needed to ease the implementation of the aforementioned
components. To facilitate ICL research, we introduce OpenICL, an open-source
toolkit for ICL and LLM evaluation. OpenICL is research-friendly with a highly
flexible architecture that users can easily combine different components to
suit their needs. It also provides various state-of-the-art retrieval and
inference methods to streamline the process of adapting ICL to cutting-edge
research. The effectiveness of OpenICL has been validated on a wide range of
NLP tasks, including classification, QA, machine translation, and semantic
parsing. As a side-product, we found OpenICL to be an efficient yet robust tool
for LLMs evaluation. OpenICL is released at

					<dc:description>  Nowadays, many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks see the demand for
incorporating knowledge external to the local information to further improve
the performance. However, there is little related work on Named Entity
Recognition (NER), which is one of the foundations of NLP. Specifically, no
studies were conducted on the query generation and re-ranking for retrieving
the related information for the purpose of improving NER. This work
demonstrates the effectiveness of a DNN-based query generation method and a
mention-aware re-ranking architecture based on BERTScore particularly for NER.
In the end, a state-of-the-art performance of 61.56 micro-f1 score on WNUT17
dataset is achieved.

					<dc:description>  Users worldwide access massive amounts of curated data in the form of
rankings on a daily basis. The societal impact of this ease of access has been
studied and work has been done to propose and enforce various notions of
fairness in rankings. Current computational methods for fair item ranking rely
on disclosing user data to a centralized server, which gives rise to privacy
concerns for the users. This work is the first to advance research at the
conjunction of producer (item) fairness and consumer (user) privacy in rankings
by exploring the incorporation of privacy-preserving techniques; specifically,
differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. Our work extends the
equity of amortized attention ranking mechanism to be privacy-preserving, and
we evaluate its effects with respect to privacy, fairness, and ranking quality.
Our results using real-world datasets show that we are able to effectively
preserve the privacy of users and mitigate unfairness of items without making
additional sacrifices to the quality of rankings in comparison to the ranking
mechanism in the clear.

					<dc:description>  The ground state properties of quantum many-body systems are a subject of
interest across chemistry, materials science, and physics. Thus, algorithms for
finding ground states have broad impacts. Variational quantum algorithms are
one class of ground state algorithm that has received significant development
in recent years. These algorithms utilize a hybrid quantum-classical computing
framework to prepare ground states on quantum computers. However, this requires
solving classical optimization problems that can become prohibitively expensive
in high dimensions. We address this challenge through the development of a
feedback-based quantum algorithm for ground state preparation that is inspired
by quantum Lyapunov control and is optimization-free. We apply this approach to
the Fermi-Hubbard model and present a variety of numerical illustrations that
analyze different aspects of the algorithm and its performance.

					<dc:description>  Two main families of node feature augmentation schemes have been explored for
enhancing GNNs: random features and spectral positional encoding. Surprisingly,
however, there is still no clear understanding of the relation between these
two augmentation schemes. Here we propose a novel family of positional encoding
schemes which draws a link between the above two approaches and improves over
both. The new approach, named Random Feature Propagation (RFP), is inspired by
the power iteration method and its generalizations. It concatenates several
intermediate steps of an iterative algorithm for computing the dominant
eigenvectors of a propagation matrix, starting from random node features.
Notably, these propagation steps are based on graph-dependent propagation
operators that can be either predefined or learned. We explore the theoretical
and empirical benefits of RFP. First, we provide theoretical justifications for
using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps, and for using
multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that RFP
significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple node
classification and graph classification benchmarks.

					<dc:description>  Given a field with a set of discrete valuations $V$, we show how the genus of
a division algebra over certain fields is related to the genus of some residue
algebras at various valuations in $V$ and the ramification data. These fields
include complete discrete valued fields and purely transcendental extensions of
number fields. When the division algebra is a quaternion, we show the
triviality of genus over many fields which include higher local fields,
function fields of curves over higher local fields and function fields of
curves over real closed fields. We also consider function fields of curves over
global fields with a rational point and show how the genus problem is related
to the $2$-torsion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of its Jacobian. As a special
case, we show how the methods developed yield better bounds on the size of the
genus over function fields of elliptic curves and demonstrate how they can be
computed directly using arithmetic data of the elliptic curve with a number of
examples.

					<dc:description>  [Context] Artificial intelligence (AI) components used in building software
solutions have substantially increased in recent years. However, many of these
solutions end up focusing on technical aspects and ignore critical
human-centered aspects. [Objective] Including human-centered aspects during
requirements engineering (RE) when building AI-based software can help achieve
more responsible, unbiased, and inclusive AI-based software solutions. [Method]
In this paper, we present a new framework developed based on human-centered AI
guidelines and a user survey to aid in collecting requirements for
human-centered AI-based software. We provide a catalog to elicit these
requirements and a conceptual model to present them visually. [Results] The
framework is applied to a case study to elicit and model requirements for
enhancing the quality of 360 degree~videos intended for virtual reality (VR)
users. [Conclusion] We found that our proposed approach helped the project team
fully understand the needs of the project to deliver. Furthermore, the
framework helped to understand what requirements need to be captured at the
initial stages against later stages in the engineering process of AI-based
software.

					<dc:description>  If $f(z)$ is a modular form of weight $k$, then the differential operator
$\vartheta_k$ defined by $\vartheta_k(f) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \frac{d}{dz}f(z) -
\frac{k}{12} E_2(z) f(z)$ (known as the Ramanujan-Serre derivative map) is a
modular form of weight $k+2$. In this paper, we obtain a simple extension of
this map and use it to get a general method to derive certain convolution sums
of the divisor functions (using the theory of modular forms). Explicit
expressions are given for four types of convolution sums and we provide many
examples for all these types of sums.

					<dc:description>  To achieve fast, robust, and accurate reconstruction of the human cortical
surfaces from 3D magnetic resonance images (MRIs), we develop a novel deep
learning-based framework, referred to as SurfNN, to reconstruct simultaneously
both inner (between white matter and gray matter) and outer (pial) surfaces
from MRIs. Different from existing deep learning-based cortical surface
reconstruction methods that either reconstruct the cortical surfaces separately
or neglect the interdependence between the inner and outer surfaces, SurfNN
reconstructs both the inner and outer cortical surfaces jointly by training a
single network to predict a midthickness surface that lies at the center of the
inner and outer cortical surfaces. The input of SurfNN consists of a 3D MRI and
an initialization of the midthickness surface that is represented both
implicitly as a 3D distance map and explicitly as a triangular mesh with
spherical topology, and its output includes both the inner and outer cortical
surfaces, as well as the midthickness surface. The method has been evaluated on
a large-scale MRI dataset and demonstrated competitive cortical surface
reconstruction performance.

					<dc:description>  Here, we consider periodic homogenization for time-fractional
Hamilton--Jacobi equations. By using the perturbed test function method, we
establish the convergence, and give estimates on a rate of convergence. A main
difficulty is the incompatibility between the function used in the doubling
variable method, and the non-locality of the Caputo derivative. Our approach is
to provide a lemma to prove the rate of convergence without the doubling
variable method with respect to the time variable, which is a key ingredient.

					<dc:description>  GX 3$+$1, an atoll type neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, was observed four
times by Soft X-ray Telescope and The Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters
on-board \textit{AstroSat} between October 5, 2017 and August 9, 2018. The
hardness-intensity-diagram of the source showed it to be in the soft spectral
state during all the four observations. The spectra of the source could be
adequately fit with a model consisting of blackbody ($\mathtt{bbody}$) and
power-law ($\mathtt{powerlaw}$) components. This yielded the blackbody radius
and mass accretion rate to be $\sim$8 km and $\sim$2 $\times$ $10^{-9}$
M$_{\odot}$ y$^{-1}$, respectively. In one of the observations, a Type I X-ray
burst having a rise and e-folding time of 0.6 and 5.6 s, respectively, was
detected. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the burst showed that the source
underwent a photospheric radius expansion. The radius of the emitting blackbody
in GX 3$+$1 and its distance were estimated to be 9.19
$\substack{+0.97\\-0.82}$ km and 10.17 $\substack{+0.07\\-0.18}$ kpc,
respectively. Temporal analysis of the burst yielded upper limits of the
fractional RMS amplitude of 7$\%$, 5$\%$ and 6$\%$ during burst start, burst
maximum and right after the radius expansion phase, respectively.

					<dc:description>  In various fields from quantum physics to biology, open quantum dynamics of a
system consisting of interacting subsystems underscore important fundamental
functionality. The local approach has been widely used for this purpose because
of its robustness against the positivity, while a recent critique argues its
the un-physicalness of obtained the stationary state obtained. As an
alternative, the global approach under the Born--Markov and secular
approximations, has attracted renewed interests. However, the controversy
remains in its violation of positivity in the short-time region and/or limited
parameter region on the Bohr frequencies of the sub-systems. In this study, we
present a formalism leading to the time-convolutionless (time-local) master
equation obtained by extending the global approach beyond the Born--Markov and
secular approximations. We apply it to the excitation energy transfer between
interacting sites in which only the terminal site weakly interacts with a
bosonic environment of finite temperature in a manner beyond the rotating-wave
approximation. We find that the formulation (1) gives the short-time behavior
with preserving positivity, (2) restores the oscillative oscillatory features
obscured by the secular approximation, and (3) leads to a stationary state very
near to the Gibbs state for the total system Hamiltonian. \end{abstract}

					<dc:description>  Systems that support users in the automatic creation of visualizations must
address several subtasks - understand the semantics of data, enumerate relevant
visualization goals and generate visualization specifications. In this work, we
pose visualization generation as a multi-stage generation problem and argue
that well-orchestrated pipelines based on large language models (LLMs) and
image generation models (IGMs) are suitable to addressing these tasks. We
present LIDA, a novel tool for generating grammar-agnostic visualizations and
infographics. LIDA comprises of 4 modules - A SUMMARIZER that converts data
into a rich but compact natural language summary, a GOAL EXPLORER that
enumerates visualization goals given the data, a VISGENERATOR that generates,
refines, executes and filters visualization code and an INFOGRAPHER module that
yields data-faithful stylized graphics using IGMs. LIDA provides a python api,
and a hybrid user interface (direct manipulation and natural language) for
interactive chart, infographics and data story generation.

					<dc:description>  For a Noetherian $R$-algebra $\Lambda$, there is a canonical inclusion
$\mathsf{tors}\Lambda\to\prod_{\mathfrak{p}\in \mathrm{Spec}
R}\mathsf{tors}(\kappa(\mathfrak{p})\Lambda)$, and each element in the image
satisfies a certain compatibility condition. We call $\Lambda$ compatible if
the image coincides with the set of all compatible elements. For example, for a
Dynkin quiver $Q$ and a commutative Noetherian ring $R$ containing a field, the
path algebra $RQ$ is compatible. In this paper, we prove that $RQ$ is
compatible when $Q$ is an extended Dynkin quiver and $R$ contains a field and
is either a Dedekind domain or a Noetherian semilocal normal ring of dimension
two.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the stellar mass - black hole mass
($\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$) relation with type 1 AGN down to
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}=10^7 M_\odot$, corresponding to a $\simeq -21$
absolute magnitude in rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), at $z = 2-2.5$. Exploiting
the deep and large-area spectroscopic survey of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark
Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we identify 66 type 1 AGN with
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{10} M_\odot$ that are
measured with single-epoch virial method using C{\sc iv} emission lines
detected in the HETDEX spectra. $\mathcal{M}_*$ of the host galaxies are
estimated from optical to near-infrared photometric data taken with Spitzer,
WISE, and ground-based 4-8m class telescopes by CIGALE SED fitting. We further
assess the validity of SED fitting in two cases by host-nuclear decomposition
performed through surface brightness profile fitting on spatially-resolved host
galaxies with JWST/NIRCam CEERS data. We obtain the
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation covering the unexplored
low-mass ranges of $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}~\sim~10^7-10^8~M_\odot$, and
conduct forward modelling to fully account for the selection biases and
observational uncertainties. The intrinsic
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation at $z\sim 2$ has a moderate
positive offset of $0.52\pm0.14$~dex from the local relation, suggestive of
more efficient black hole growth at higher redshift even in the low-mass regime
of $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}~\sim~10^7-10^8~M_\odot$. Our
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation is inconsistent with the
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ suppression at the low-$\mathcal{M}_*$ regime
predicted by recent hydrodynamic simulations at a $98\%$ confidence level,
suggesting that feedback in the low-mass systems may be weaker than those
produced in hydrodynamic simulations.

					<dc:description>  To protect privacy and prevent malicious use of deepfake, current studies
propose methods that interfere with the generation process, such as detection
and destruction approaches. However, these methods suffer from sub-optimal
generalization performance to unseen models and add undesirable noise to the
original image. To address these problems, we propose a new problem formulation
for deepfake prevention: generating a ``scapegoat image'' by modifying the
style of the original input in a way that is recognizable as an avatar by the
user, but impossible to reconstruct the real face. Even in the case of
malicious deepfake, the privacy of the users is still protected. To achieve
this, we introduce an optimization-based editing method that utilizes GAN
inversion to discourage deepfake models from generating similar scapegoats. We
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method through quantitative and user
studies.

					<dc:description>  Let $K$ be a number field and $\mathcal{C}$ a full class of finite groups. We
write $K^{\mathcal{C}}/K$ for the maximal pro-$\mathcal{C}$ Galois extension of
$K$, and $G_K^{\mathcal{C}}$ for its Galois group. In this paper, we deal with
the following question: ``For $i=1,2$, let $K_i$ be a number field,
$\mathcal{C}_i$ a nontrivial full class of finite groups, and $\sigma
:G_{K_1}^{\mathcal{C}_1}\overset \sim \rightarrow G_{K_2}^{\mathcal{C}_2}$ an
isomorphism. Is $\sigma$ induced by a unique isomorphism between
$K_2^{\mathcal{C}_2}/K_2$ and $K_1^{\mathcal{C}_1}/K_1$?'' In one of the main
results, we answer this question affirmatively only assuming that the upper
Dirichlet density of the set of prime numbers concerning $\mathcal{C}_i$ is not
zero for at least one $i$. Moreover, we obtain some results which are still
valid even when $\mathcal{C}_1$, $\mathcal{C}_2$ consist of all finite
$p$-groups for a prime number $p$, that is, $G_{K_1}^{\mathcal{C}_1}$,
$G_{K_2}^{\mathcal{C}_2}$ are the maximal pro-$p$ quotients of the absolute
Galois groups.

					<dc:description>  A review is given on the theory of the metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in
doped semiconductors. We focus in particular on the theory of their anomalous
magnetic properties, caused by the interplay of disorder and correlations, and
the possibility of finite temperature delocalization transitions caused by the
correlation induced temperature dependence of the spin scattering rate from
magnetic moments (MMs). This review article is devoted to the memory of
Konstantin B. Efetov.

					<dc:description>  Radio frequency reflectometry techniques enable high bandwidth readout of
semiconductor quantum dots. Careful impedance matching of the resonant circuit
is required to achieve high sensitivity, which however proves challenging at
cryogenic temperatures. Gallium arsenide-based voltage-tunable capacitors,
so-called varactor diodes, can be used for in-situ tuning of the circuit
impedance but deteriorate and fail at temperatures below 10 K and in magnetic
fields. Here, we investigate a varactor based on strontium titanate with
hyperabrupt capacitance-voltage characteristic, that is, a capacitance
tunability similar to the best gallium arsenide-based devices. The varactor
design introduced here is compact, scalable and easy to wirebond with an
accessible capacitance range from 45 pF to 3.2 pF. We tune a resonant
inductor-capacitor circuit to perfect impedance matching and observe robust,
temperature and field independent matching down to 11 mK and up to 2 T in-plane
field. Finally, we perform gate-dispersive charge sensing on a
germanium/silicon core/shell nanowire hole double quantum dot, paving the way
towards gate-based single-shot spin readout. Our results bring small, magnetic
field-resilient, highly tunable varactors to mK temperatures, expanding the
toolbox of cryo-radio frequency applications.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we augment existing techniques for simulating flexible objects
to include models for crack initiation and propagation in three-dimensional
volumes. By analyzing the stress tensors computed over a finite element model,
the simulation determines where cracks should initiate and in what directions
they should propagate. We demonstrate our results with animations of breaking
bowls, cracking walls, and objects that fracture when they collide. By varying
the shape of the objects, the material properties, and the initial conditions
of the simulations, we can create strikingly different effects ranging from a
wall that shatters when it is hit by a wrecking ball to a bowl that breaks in
two when it is dropped on edge. This paper received the SIGGRAPH 99 Impact

					<dc:description>  Human-centric perceptions (e.g., pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian
detection, person re-identification, etc.) play a key role in industrial
applications of visual models. While specific human-centric tasks have their
own relevant semantic aspect to focus on, they also share the same underlying
semantic structure of the human body. However, few works have attempted to
exploit such homogeneity and design a general-propose model for human-centric
tasks. In this work, we revisit a broad range of human-centric tasks and unify
them in a minimalist manner. We propose UniHCP, a Unified Model for
Human-Centric Perceptions, which unifies a wide range of human-centric tasks in
a simplified end-to-end manner with the plain vision transformer architecture.
With large-scale joint training on 33 human-centric datasets, UniHCP can
outperform strong baselines on several in-domain and downstream tasks by direct
evaluation. When adapted to a specific task, UniHCP achieves new SOTAs on a
wide range of human-centric tasks, e.g., 69.8 mIoU on CIHP for human parsing,
86.18 mA on PA-100K for attribute prediction, 90.3 mAP on Market1501 for ReID,
and 85.8 JI on CrowdHuman for pedestrian detection, performing better than
specialized models tailored for each task.

					<dc:title>Shape Transformation Using Variational Implicit Functions</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Traditionally, shape transformation using implicit functions is performed in
two distinct steps: 1) creating two implicit functions, and 2) interpolating
between these two functions. We present a new shape transformation method that
combines these two tasks into a single step. We create a transformation between
two N-dimensional objects by casting this as a scattered data interpolation
problem in N + 1 dimensions. For the case of 2D shapes, we place all of our
data constraints within two planes, one for each shape. These planes are placed
parallel to one another in 3D. Zero-valued constraints specify the locations of
shape boundaries and positive-valued constraints are placed along the normal
direction in towards the center of the shape. We then invoke a variational
interpolation technique (the 3D generalization of thin-plate interpolation),
and this yields a single implicit function in 3D. Intermediate shapes are
simply the zero-valued contours of 2D slices through this 3D function. Shape
transformation between 3D shapes can be performed similarly by solving a 4D
interpolation problem. To our knowledge, ours is the first shape transformation
method to unify the tasks of implicit function creation and interpolation. The
transformations produced by this method appear smooth and natural, even between
objects of differing topologies. If desired, one or more additional shapes may
be introduced that influence the intermediate shapes in a sequence. Our method
can also reconstruct surfaces from multiple slices that are not restricted to
being parallel to one another.

					<dc:description>  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has recently been regarded as a
paradigm-shifting technology beyond 5G, for its flexibility on smartly
adjusting the response to the impinging electromagnetic (EM) waves. Usually,
RIS can be implemented by properly reconfiguring the adjustable parameters of
each RIS unit to align the signal phase on the receiver side. And it is
believed that the phase alignment can be also mechanically achieved by a metal
plate with the same physical size. However, we found in the prototype
experiments that, a well-rotated metal plate can only approximately perform as
well as RIS under limited conditions, although its scattering efficiency is
relatively higher. When it comes to the case of spherical wave impinging, RIS
outperforms the metal plate even beyond the receiving near-field regions. We
analyze this phenomenon with wave optics theory and propose explicit scattering
models for both the metal plate and RIS in general scenarios. Finally, the
models are validated by simulations and field measurements.

					<dc:description>  Neural text to speech (TTS) generally consists of cascaded architecture with
separately optimized acoustic model and vocoder or end-to-end architecture with
continuous mel-spectrograms or self-extracted speech frames as the intermediate
representations to bridge acoustic model and vocoder in joint training, which
suffers from two limitations: 1) the continuous acoustic frames are hard to
predict with phoneme only, acoustic information are also needed like duration
or pitch to solve the one-to-many problem, which is not easy to scale on large
scale and noise dataset; 2) diverse speech output is not straightforward with
continuous speech features and complex VAE or flow based models are often
needed. In this paper, we propose FoundationTTS, a new speech synthesis system
with discrete speech tokens extraction from neural audio codec and large
language modelling based acoustic model for optimizing linguistic and acoustic
tokens simultaneously. Specifically, 1) we propose a hierarchical codec network
based on vector-quantized auto-encoders with adversarial training (VQ-GAN) to
first extract continuous frame-level speech representations with fine-grained
codec, and the coarse-grained codec reconstructs the continuous speech frame
with less quantizers; 2) we jointly optimize speech token, linguistic tokens,
speaker token together with a large language model and autoregressively predict
the discrete speech tokens. Experiments show that FoundationTTS achieves a MOS
gain +0.14 compared to baseline system, and in ASR customization tasks, our
method achieves 7.09\% and 10.35\% WERR respectively over two strong customized
ASR baseline.

					<dc:description>  To deal with the explosive growth of mobile traffic, millimeter-wave (mmWave)
communications with abundant bandwidth resources have been applied to vehicular
networks. As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection
enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and
to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In
this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and
transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the
throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The
first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a
low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint
relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay
contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further
performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different
environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that
both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in
terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact
of threshold selection on achievable performance.

					<dc:description>  Orbital eccentricity is one of the basic planetary properties, whose
distribution may shed light on the history of planet formation and evolution.
Here, in a series of works on Planetary Orbit Eccentricity Trends (dubbed
POET), we study the distribution of planetary eccentricities and their
dependence on stellar/planetary properties. In this paper, the first work of
the POET series, we investigate whether and how the eccentricities of small
planets depend on stellar metallicities (e.g., [Fe/H]). Previous studies on
giant planets have found a significant correlation between planetary
eccentricities and their host metallicities. Nevertheless, whether such a
correlation exists in small planets (e.g. super-Earth and sub-Neptune) remains
unclear. Here, benefiting from the large and homogeneous LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler
sample, we characterize the eccentricity distributions of 244 (286) small
planets in single (multiple) transiting systems with the transit duration ratio
method. We confirm the eccentricity-metallicity trend that eccentricities of
single small planets increase with stellar metallicities. Interestingly, a
similar trend between eccentricity and metallicity is also found in the radial
velocity (RV) sample. We also found that the mutual inclination of multiple
transiting systems increases with metallicity, which predicts a moderate
eccentricity-metallicity rising trend. Our results of the correlation between
eccentricity (inclination) and metallicity for small planet support the core
accretion model for planet formation, and they could be footprints of self
(and/or external) excitation processes during the history of planet formation
and evolution.

					<dc:title>Does the first-serving team have a structural advantage in pickleball?</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>DeFord, Daryl R.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Ethier, Stewart N.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In pickleball doubles with conventional side-out scoring, points are scored
only by the serving team. The serve alternates during a game, with each team
serving until it has faulted twice, except at the beginning of the game, in
which case the first-serving team serves until it has faulted once. A game to
$n$ can be modeled by a Markov chain in a state space with $4n^2+10$ states.
Typically, $n=11$ or $n=15$. The authors, both pickleball players, were
motivated by the question in the title. Surprisingly, the answer to that
question depends on the number of points needed to win. In a game to 11, the
first-serving team has a very slight disadvantage, whereas, in a game to 15,
the first-serving team has a very slight advantage. It should be noted that
these advantages and disadvantages are so small that they cannot be detected by
simulation and are revealed only by an analytical solution. The practical
implication is that a team that is offered the choice of side or serve should
probably choose side.
  We investigate the probability of winning a game to 11, as well as the mean
and standard deviation of the duration (or the number of rallies) of a game to
11. We compare these results with the corresponding ones when modified rally
scoring is used in a game to 21. We also investigate the title question for a
hybrid form of rally scoring that combines modified rally scoring and
traditional doubles server rotation.

					<dc:description>  Domain generalization in semantic segmentation aims to alleviate the
performance degradation on unseen domains through learning domain-invariant
features. Existing methods diversify images in the source domain by adding
complex or even abnormal textures to reduce the sensitivity to domain specific
features. However, these approaches depend heavily on the richness of the
texture bank, and training them can be time-consuming. In contrast to importing
textures arbitrarily or augmenting styles randomly, we focus on the single
source domain itself to achieve generalization. In this paper, we present a
novel adaptive texture filtering mechanism to suppress the influence of texture
without using augmentation, thus eliminating the interference of
domain-specific features. Further, we design a hierarchical guidance
generalization network equipped with structure-guided enhancement modules,
which purpose is to learn the domain-invariant generalized knowledge. Extensive
experiments together with ablation studies on widely-used datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and reveal its
superiority over other state-of-the-art alternatives.

					<dc:description>  Pancreatic duct dilation indicates a high risk of various pancreatic
diseases. Segmentation of dilated pancreatic ducts on computed tomography (CT)
images shows the potential to assist the early diagnosis, surgical planning and
prognosis. Because of the ducts' tiny sizes, slender tubular structures and the
surrounding distractions, most current researches on pancreatic duct
segmentation achieve low accuracy and always have segmentation errors on the
terminal parts of the ducts. To address these problems, we propose a terminal
guidance mechanism called cascaded terminal guidance network (CTG-Net).
Firstly, a terminal attention mechanism is established on the skeletons
extracted from the coarse predictions. Then, to get fine terminal segmentation,
a subnetwork is designed for jointly learning the local intensity from the
original images, feature cues from coarse predictions and global anatomy
information from the pancreas distance transform maps. Finally, a terminal
distraction attention module which explicitly learns the distribution of the
terminal distraction is proposed to reduce the false positive and false
negative predictions. We also propose a new metric called tDice to measure the
terminal segmentation accuracy for targets with tubular structures and two
segmentation metrics for distractions. We collect our dilated pancreatic duct
segmentation dataset with 150 CT scans from patients with 5 types of pancreatic
tumors. Experimental results on our dataset show that our proposed approach
boosts dilated pancreatic duct segmentation accuracy by nearly 20% compared
with the existing results, and achieves more than 9% improvement for the
terminal segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

					<dc:description>  We characterize two-dimensional (2D) microtubule-based active nematics driven
by light-responsive kinesin motor clusters. We assess two constructs of
optogenetic kinesin: opto-K401, a processive motor, and opto-K365, a
non-processive motor. Measurements reveal an order of magnitude improvement in
the contrast of nematic flow speeds between maximally- and
minimally-illuminated states for opto-K365 motors. Focusing on opto-K365
nematics, we characterize both the steady-state flow and defect density as a
function of applied light and examine the transient behavior between
steady-states. The steady-state nematic flow and defect densities are set by
the applied light intensity across centimeter-sized samples, independent of
initial conditions. Although nematic flow reaches steady-state within tens of
seconds, the defect density exhibits transient behavior for 4 to 10 minutes,
showing a separation between small-scale active reorganization and system-scale
structural states. This work establishes an experimental platform to test
theoretical frameworks which exploit spatiotemporally-heterogeneous patterns of
activity to generate targeted dynamical states.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we study the weak decay between two heavy baryons $
\mathcal{B}_i(\frac{1}{2}^+)\to \mathcal{B}_f(\frac{3}{2}^+)$ in the
light-front quark model where three-quark picture is employed for baryon. We
derive general form of transition amplitude of $
\mathcal{B}_i(\frac{1}{2}^+)\to \mathcal{B}_f(\frac{3}{2}^+)$, and analyze two
specific cases of transitions: the weak decays of single heavy baryon
$\Sigma_{b} \to \Sigma_{c}^*$ and the decay of double-charmed baryon
$\Xi_{cc}$. We compute the hadronic form factors for the transitions and apply
them to study the decay widths of the semi-leptonic $\mathcal
B_i(\frac{1}{2}^+)\to\mathcal B_f(\frac{3}{2}^+) l\bar{\nu}_l$ and non-leptonic
$\mathcal B_i(\frac{1}{2}^+)\to\mathcal B_f(\frac{3}{2}^+)M$. Previously we
studied the transition $\Sigma_{b} \to \Sigma_{c}^*$ with the quark-diquark
picture of baryon in the light-front quark model. Here we revisit this
transition with three-quark picture of baryon. At the quark level, the
transition $\Sigma_{b} \to \Sigma_{c}^*$ is induced by the $b\rightarrow c$
transition.The two unchanged light quarks which possesses definite and same
spin in initial and final state can be viewed as the spectator, so the
spectator approximation can be applied directly. For the weak decay of doubly
charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}$, a $c$ quark decays to a light quark $q_1$, so both
the initial state $cc$ and final state $q_1q_2$ ($q_1$ and the original $q_2$
in initial state may be the same flavor quarks) which possess definite spin are
no longer spectators. A rearrangement of quarks for initial and final states is
adopted to isolate the unchanged subsystem $cq_2$ which can be viewed as the
spectator approximately. Future measurements on these channels will constrain
the nonperturbative parameter in the wavefunctions and test the model
predictions.

					<dc:description>  We study slow-roll inflation model controlled by the modular flavor symmetry.
In the model, the modulus field plays a role of inflaton and the introduction
of the stabilizer field coupled to a modular form in the superpotential
produces the inflaton potential. In order to generate the flat direction for
the slow-roll inflation, we consider the K\&quot;{a}hler potential corrected by the
modular form. It is noted that the modulus field perpendicular to the inflaton
direction is stabilized during the inflation. The model is turns out to be
consistent with the current observations and behaves similarly to the
$\alpha$-attractor models in some parameter spaces. The inflaton rolls down to
the CP-symmetric vacuum at the end of inflation.

					<dc:description>  Anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a major intelligent
service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, device-activity
analysis, and security supervision. However, the heterogeneous distribution of
data and resource-constrained end nodes present challenges for existing anomaly
detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and
multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical
heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing,
computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems.
In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated
learning (AFL) framework to enable decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train
a global anomaly detection model. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, a HAPS
operates as a central aerial server, and the local models trained in UAVs are
uploaded to the HAPS for global aggregation due to its wide coverage and strong
storage and computation capabilities. We introduce a UAV selection strategy
into the AFL framework to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large
energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and detection
accuracy of the global model. To ensure the security of transmissions between
UAVs and the HAPS, we add designed noise to local model parameters in UAVs to
achieve differential privacy. Moreover, we propose a compound-action
actor-critic (CA2C)-based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV
trajectory planning algorithm to further enhance the overall federated
execution efficiency and detection model accuracy. Extensive experimental
evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can
achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low
energy consumption.

					<dc:description>  Angle-constrained formation control has attracted much attention from control
community due to the advantage that inter-edge angles are invariant under
uniform translations, rotations, and scalings of the whole formation. However,
almost all the existing angle-constrained formation control methods are limited
to undirected triangulated sensing graphs. In this paper, we propose an
angle-constrained formation control approach under a Leader-First Follower
sensing architecture, where the sensing graph is directed and non-triangulated.
Both shape stabilization and maneuver control are achieved under arbitrary
initial configurations of the formation. During the formation process, the
control input of each agent is based on relative positions from its neighbors
measured in the local reference frame and wireless communications among agents
are not required. We show that the proposed distributed formation controller
ensures global exponential stability of the desired formation for an nagent
system. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that the convergence rate of the
whole formation is solely determined by partial specific angles within the
target formation. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is
illustrated by carrying out experiments both in simulation environments and on
real robotic platforms.

					<dc:description>  This paper considers intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MISO) interference channel (IFC), where multiple transmitters
(Txs) serve their corresponding receivers (Rxs) in a shared spectrum with the
aid of IRSs. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of the Rxs by jointly
optimizing the transmit covariance matrices at the Txs, the phase shifts at the
IRSs, and the resource allocation subject to the individual energy harvesting
(EH) constraints at the Rxs. Towards this goal and based on the well-known
power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receiver structures, we consider
three practical transmission schemes, namely the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS scheme,
the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided
TDMA-D scheme. The latter two schemes differ in whether the Txs employ
deterministic energy signals known to all the Rxs. Despite the non-convexity of
the three optimization problems corresponding to the three transmission
schemes, we develop computationally efficient algorithms to address them
suboptimally, respectively, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating
optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Moreover, we
conceive feasibility checking methods for these problems, based on which the
initial points for the proposed algorithms are constructed. Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed IRS-aided schemes significantly outperform their
counterparts without IRSs in terms of sum rate and maximum EH requirements that
can be satisfied under various setups. In addition, the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS
scheme generally achieves the best sum rate performance among the three
proposed IRS-aided schemes, and if not, increasing the number of IRS elements
can always accomplish it.

					<dc:title>The (Surprising) Rate Optimality of Greedy Procedures for Large-Scale

					<dc:description>  Large-scale ranking and selection (R&amp;S), which aims to select the best
alternative with the largest mean performance from a finite set of
alternatives, has emerged as an important research topic in simulation
optimization. Ideal large-scale R&amp;S procedures should be rate optimal, i.e.,
the total sample size required to deliver an asymptotically non-zero
probability of correct selection (PCS) grows at the minimal rate (linear rate)
in the number of alternatives. Surprisingly, we discover that the na\&quot;ive
greedy procedure that keeps sampling the alternative with the largest running
average performs strikingly well and appears rate optimal. To understand this
discovery, we develop a new boundary-crossing perspective and prove that the
greedy procedure is indeed rate optimal. We further show that the derived PCS
lower bound is asymptotically tight for the slippage configuration of means
with a common variance. Moreover, we propose the explore-first greedy (EFG)
procedure and its enhanced version ($\mbox{EFG}^+$ procedure) by adding an
exploration phase to the na\&quot;ive greedy procedure. Both procedures are proven
to be rate optimal and consistent. Last, we conduct extensive numerical
experiments to empirically understand the performance of our greedy procedures
in solving large-scale R&amp;S problems.

					<dc:description>  TianQin is a planned Chinese space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory
with a frequency band of 10-4 to 1Hz. Optical telescopes are essential for the
delivery of the measurement beam to support a precise distance measurement
between pairs of proof masses. As the design is driven by the interferometric
displacement sensitivity requirements, the stability control of optical path
length (OPL) is extremely important beyond the traditional requirement of
diffraction-limited imaging quality. In a telescope system, the recurring
tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise arises from the OPL variation due to the
wavefront deformation and angular misalignment. The pupil aberrations are
preferred option to understand the OPL specifications and further suppress TTL
coupling noise. To correct the pupil aberrations, we derive primary pupil
aberrations in a series expansion form, and then refine the formulation of
merit function by combining the pupil aberration theory and traditional image
aberration theory. The automatic correction of pupil aberrations is carried out
by using the macro programming in the commercial optical software Zemax,
leading to a high performance telescope design. The design results show that on
one side the pupil aberrations have been corrected, and on the other side, its
optical performance meets the requirements for TianQin project. The RMS
wavefront error over the science field of view (FOV) is less than {\lambda}/200
and the maximum TTL coupling noise over the entire 300 urad FOV is
0.0034nm/urad. We believe that our design approach can be a good guide for the
space telescope design in any other space-based GW detection project, as well
as other similar optical systems.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the relevance of quantum gravity during inflation to address
the Hubble tension that arises from Planck 2018 and SH0ES data sets. We show
that the effect of quantum gravity during inflation can increase the rate of
change of $H_0$, thereby accounting for a wide range of observed $H_0$.
Further, we show that due to the quantum gravity effect on inflation, the
temperature at the onset of reheating can be lower than the standard case,
causing delays in the reheating process. The role of quantum gravity is
inevitable in settling the Hubble tension. The results of the present study may
find use in resolving the Hubble tension, in validating inflationary model and
quantum gravity.

					<dc:description>  Rehearsal, retraining on a stored small data subset of old tasks, has been
proven effective in solving catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.
However, due to the sampled data may have a large bias towards the original
dataset, retraining them is susceptible to driving continual domain drift of
old tasks in feature space, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we focus on
tackling the continual domain drift problem with centroid distance
distillation. First, we propose a centroid caching mechanism for sampling data
points based on constructed centroids to reduce the sample bias in rehearsal.
Then, we present a centroid distance distillation that only stores the centroid
distance to reduce the continual domain drift. The experiments on four
continual learning datasets show the superiority of the proposed method, and
the continual domain drift can be reduced.

					<dc:description>  Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected the neutrino event
IceCube-170922A from the radio-emitting tidal disruption event (TDE) named
AT2019dsg, indicating to be one of the most likely sources of high-energy
cosmic rays. So far, the photo-hadronic interaction is considered in the
literature to interpret neutrino emission from AT2019dsg. Here, we examine
whether the IceCube-170922A along with the broadband electromagnetic emission
from the source can also be described by a pure hadronic emission employing the
proton blazar inspired (PBI) model, which takes into account the
non-relativistic protons that emerge under the charge neutrality situation of
the blazar jet and thus offers sufficient target matter for pp interactions
with shock-accelerated protons. Our findings show that the PBI model is able to
consistently describe the IceCube observations on AT2019dsg and the broadband
spectrum of the source without exceeding the observed X-ray and gamma-ray flux
upper limits imposed by the XMM-Newton and Fermi-LAT telescopes.

					<dc:description>  The latest version of MPI introduces new functionalities like the Session
model, but it still lacks fault management mechanisms. Past efforts produced
tools and MPI standard extensions to manage fault presence, including ULFM.
These measures are effective against faults but do not fully support the new
additions to the standard. In this paper, we combine the fault management
possibilities of ULFM with the new Session model functionality introduced in
version 4.0 of the standard. We focus on the communicator creation procedure,
highlighting criticalities and proposing a method to circumvent them. The
experimental campaign shows that the proposed solution does not significantly
affect applications' execution time and scalability while better managing the
insurgence of faults.

					<dc:description>  The entropic fictitious play (EFP) is a recently proposed algorithm that
minimizes the sum of a convex functional and entropy in the space of measures
-- such an objective naturally arises in the optimization of a two-layer neural
network in the mean-field regime. In this work, we provide a concise
primal-dual analysis of EFP in the setting where the learning problem exhibits
a finite-sum structure. We establish quantitative global convergence guarantees
for both the continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics based on properties of
a proximal Gibbs measure introduced in Nitanda et al. (2022). Furthermore, our
primal-dual framework entails a memory-efficient particle-based implementation
of the EFP update, and also suggests a connection to gradient boosting methods.
We illustrate the efficiency of our novel implementation in experiments
including neural network optimization and image synthesis.

					<dc:description>  Increasing the number of electrons in electrostatically confined quantum dots
can enable faster qubit gates. Although this has been experimentally
demonstrated, a detailed quantitative understanding has been missing. Here we
study one- and three-electron quantum dots in silicon/silicon-germanium
heterostructures within the context of electrically-driven spin resonance
(EDSR) using full configuration interaction and tight binding approaches. Our
calculations show that anharmonicity of the confinement potential plays an
important role: while the EDSR Rabi frequency of electrons in a harmonic
potential is indifferent to the electron number, soft anharmonic confinements
lead to larger and hard anharmonic confinements lead to smaller Rabi
frequencies. We also confirm that double dots allow fast Rabi oscillations, and
further suggest that purposefully engineered confinements can also yield
similarly fast Rabi oscillations in a single dot. Finally, we discuss the role
of interface steps. These findings have important implications for the design
of multielectron Si/SiGe quantum dot qubits.

					<dc:description>  Using more reference frames can significantly improve the compression
efficiency in neural video compression. However, in low-latency scenarios, most
existing neural video compression frameworks usually use the previous one frame
as reference. Or a few frameworks which use the previous multiple frames as
reference only adopt a simple multi-reference frames propagation mechanism. In
this paper, we present a more reasonable multi-reference frames propagation
mechanism for neural video compression, called butterfly multi-reference frame
propagation mechanism (Butterfly), which allows a more effective feature fusion
of multi-reference frames. By this, we can generate more accurate temporal
context conditional prior for Contextual Coding Module. Besides, when the
number of decoded frames does not meet the required number of reference frames,
we duplicate the nearest reference frame to achieve the requirement, which is
better than duplicating the furthest one. Experiment results show that our
method can significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA), and
our neural codec can achieve -7.6% bitrate save on HEVC Class D dataset when
compares with our base single-reference frame model with the same compression
configuration.

					<dc:description>  Correlation exploitation is essential for efficient multi-user channel
estimation (MUCE) in massive MIMO systems. However, the existing works either
rely on presumed strong correlation or learn the correlation through large
amount of labeled data, which are difficult to acquire in a real system. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive MUCE algorithm based on contrastive feature
learning. The contrastive learning (CL) is used to automatically learn the
similarity within channels by extracting the channel state information (CSI)
features based on location information. The similar features will be fed into
the downstream network to explore the strong correlations among CSI features to
improve the MUCE performance with a small number of labeled data. Simulation
results show that the contrastive feature learning can enhance the overall MUCE
performance with high training efficiency.

					<dc:title>Models See Hallucinations: Evaluating the Factuality in Video Captioning</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Liu, Hui</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Video captioning aims to describe events in a video with natural language. In
recent years, many works have focused on improving captioning models'
performance. However, like other text generation tasks, it risks introducing
factual errors not supported by the input video. These factual errors can
seriously affect the quality of the generated text, sometimes making it
completely unusable. Although factual consistency has received much research
attention in text-to-text tasks (e.g., summarization), it is less studied in
the context of vision-based text generation. In this work, we conduct a
detailed human evaluation of the factuality in video captioning and collect two
annotated factuality datasets. We find that 57.0% of the model-generated
sentences have factual errors, indicating it is a severe problem in this field.
However, existing evaluation metrics are mainly based on n-gram matching and
show little correlation with human factuality annotation. We further propose a
weakly-supervised, model-based factuality metric FactVC, which outperforms
previous metrics on factuality evaluation of video captioning. The datasets and
metrics will be released to promote future research for video captioning.

					<dc:description>  Digital documentation of large interiors of historical buildings is an
exhausting task since most of the areas of interest are beyond typical human
reach. We advocate the use of autonomous teams of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) to speed up the documentation process by several orders of
magnitude while allowing for a repeatable, accurate, and condition-independent
solution capable of precise collision-free operation at great heights. The
proposed multi-robot approach allows for performing tasks requiring dynamic
scene illumination in large-scale real-world scenarios, a process previously
applicable only in small-scale laboratory-like conditions. Extensive
experimental analyses range from single-UAV imaging to specialized lighting
techniques requiring accurate coordination of multiple UAVs. The system's
robustness is demonstrated in more than two hundred autonomous flights in
fifteen historical monuments requiring superior safety while lacking access to
external localization. This unique experimental campaign, cooperated with
restorers and conservators, brought numerous lessons transferable to other
safety-critical robotic missions in documentation and inspection tasks.

					<dc:description>  Time reflection and refraction are temporal analogies of the spatial boundary
effects derived from Fermat's principle. They occur when classical waves strike
a time boundary where an abrupt change in the properties of the medium is
introduced. The main features of time-reflected and refracted waves are the
shift of frequency and conservation of momentum, which offer a new degree of
freedom for steering extreme waves and controlling phases of matter. The
concept was originally proposed for manipulating optical waves more than five
decades ago. However, due to the extreme challenges in the ultrafast
engineering of the optical materials, the experimental realization of the time
boundary effects remains elusive. Here, we introduce a time boundary into a
momentum lattice of ultracold atoms and simultaneously demonstrate the time
reflection and refraction experimentally. Through launching a
Gaussian-superposed state into the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) atomic chain, we
observe the time-reflected and refracted waves when the input state strikes a
time boundary. Furthermore, we detect a transition from time
reflection/refraction to localization with increasing strength of disorder and
show that the time boundary effects are robust against considerable disorder.
Our work opens a new avenue for future exploration of time boundaries and
spatiotemporal lattices, and their interplay with non-Hermiticity and many-body
interactions.

					<dc:description>  We consider the problem of detecting whether a power-law inhomogeneous random
graph contains a geometric community, and we frame this as an hypothesis
testing problem. More precisely, we assume that we are given a sample from an
unknown distribution on the space of graphs on n vertices. Under the null
hypothesis, the sample originates from the inhomogeneous random graph with a
heavy-tailed degree sequence. Under the alternative hypothesis, $k = o(n)$
vertices are given spatial locations and connect between each other following
the geometric inhomogeneous random graph connection rule. The remaining $n-k$
vertices follow the inhomogeneous random graph connection rule. We propose a
simple and efficient test, which is based on counting normalized triangles, to
differentiate between the two hypotheses. We prove that our test correctly
detects the presence of the community with high probability as $n \to \infty$,
and identifies large-degree vertices of the community with high probability.

					<dc:description>  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for safely deploying
machine learning models in the wild. One of the key challenges is that models
lack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce
overconfident predictions on OOD data. Recent work on outlier synthesis modeled
the feature space as parametric Gaussian distribution, a strong and restrictive
assumption that might not hold in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Non-Parametric Outlier Synthesis (NPOS), which generates artificial
OOD training data and facilitates learning a reliable decision boundary between
ID and OOD data. Importantly, our proposed synthesis approach does not make any
distributional assumption on the ID embeddings, thereby offering strong
flexibility and generality. We show that our synthesis approach can be
mathematically interpreted as a rejection sampling framework. Extensive
experiments show that NPOS can achieve superior OOD detection performance,
outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin. Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/npos.

					<dc:description>  Peripancreatic vessel segmentation and anatomical labeling play extremely
important roles to assist the early diagnosis, surgery planning and prognosis
for patients with pancreatic tumors. However, most current techniques cannot
achieve satisfactory segmentation performance for peripancreatic veins and
usually make predictions with poor integrity and connectivity. Besides,
unsupervised labeling algorithms cannot deal with complex anatomical variation
while fully supervised methods require a large number of voxel-wise annotations
for training, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address
these problems, we propose our Automated Peripancreatic vEssel Segmentation and
lAbeling (APESA) framework, to not only highly improve the segmentation
performance for peripancreatic veins, but also efficiently identify the
peripancreatic artery branches. There are two core modules in our proposed
APESA framework: iterative trunk growth module (ITGM) for vein segmentation and
weakly supervised labeling mechanism (WSLM) for artery branch identification.
Our proposed ITGM is composed of a series of trunk growth modules, each of
which chooses the most reliable trunk of a basic vessel prediction by the
largest connected constraint, and seeks for the possible growth branches by
branch proposal network. Our designed iterative process guides the raw trunk to
be more complete and fully connected. Our proposed WSLM consists of an
unsupervised rule-based preprocessing for generating pseudo branch annotations,
and an anatomical labeling network to learn the branch distribution voxel by
voxel. We achieve Dice of 94.01% for vein segmentation on our collected
dataset, which boosts the accuracy by nearly 10% compared with the
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we also achieve Dice of 97.01% on
segmentation and competitive performance on anatomical labeling for
peripancreatic arteries.

					<dc:title>DwinFormer: Dual Window Transformers for End-to-End Monocular Depth
  Estimation</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Depth estimation from a single image is of paramount importance in the realm
of computer vision, with a multitude of applications. Conventional methods
suffer from the trade-off between consistency and fine-grained details due to
the local-receptive field limiting their practicality. This lack of long-range
dependency inherently comes from the convolutional neural network part of the
architecture. In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely
DwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for
end-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window
self-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,
respectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware
features while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of
local and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and
long-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally
expensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,
Dwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such
as translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.
Furthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which
may result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing
encoder and decoder features. In contrast, the Dwin-CAT employs both local and
global window cross-attention to seamlessly fuse encoder and decoder features
with both fine-grained local and contextually aware global information,
effectively amending semantic gap. Empirical evidence obtained through
extensive experimentation on the NYU-Depth-V2 and KITTI datasets demonstrates
the superiority of the proposed method, consistently outperforming existing
approaches across both indoor and outdoor environments.

					<dc:title>Optimal Periodic Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Fourier
  Integral Pseudospectral and Edge-Detection Methods</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Elgindy, Kareem T.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This study describes the development of a novel numerical optimization
framework to maximize the endurance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We
address the problem of numerically determining the optimal thrust and cruise
angle of attack in a two-dimensional space for a UAV under certain initial,
periodic, and bound constraints. The time horizon of the free final time
optimal control problem (OCP) is first normalized, and the normalized OCP in
integral form is discretized in physical space into a nonlinear programming
problem (NLP) using Fourier collocation and quadrature based on equispaced
points. Great attention in this work is placed on the accurate detection of
jump discontinuities and resolving the thrust history effectively directly from
the Fourier pseudospectral (FPS) data through a novel edge-detection method
without any smoothing techniques. The numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed method is simple, stable, and easy to implement.

					<dc:description>  Reliable confidence estimation for the predictions is important in many
safety-critical applications. However, modern deep neural networks are often
overconfident for their incorrect predictions. Recently, many calibration
methods have been proposed to alleviate the overconfidence problem. With
calibrated confidence, a primary and practical purpose is to detect
misclassification errors by filtering out low-confidence predictions (known as
failure prediction). In this paper, we find a general, widely-existed but
actually-neglected phenomenon that most confidence calibration methods are
useless or harmful for failure prediction. We investigate this problem and
reveal that popular confidence calibration methods often lead to worse
confidence separation between correct and incorrect samples, making it more
difficult to decide whether to trust a prediction or not. Finally, inspired by
the natural connection between flat minima and confidence separation, we
propose a simple hypothesis: flat minima is beneficial for failure prediction.
We verify this hypothesis via extensive experiments and further boost the
performance by combining two different flat minima techniques. Our code is

					<dc:description>  A two-dimensional (2D) Weyl semimetal featuring a spin-polarized linear band
dispersion and a nodal Fermi surface is a new topological phase of matter. It
is a solid-state realization of Weyl fermions in an intrinsic 2D system. The
nontrivial topology of 2D Weyl cones guarantees the existence of a new form of
topologically protected boundary states, Fermi string edge states. In this
work, we report the realization of a 2D Weyl semimetal in monolayer-thick
epitaxial bismuthene grown on SnS(Se) substrate. The intrinsic band gap of
bismuthene is eliminated by the space-inversion-symmetry-breaking substrate
perturbations, resulting in a gapless spin-polarized Weyl band dispersion. The
linear dispersion and spin polarization of the Weyl fermion states are observed
in our spin and angle-resolved photoemission measurements. In addition, the
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy reveals a pronounced local density
of states at the edge, suggesting the existence of Fermi string edge states.
These results open the door for the experimental exploration of the exotic
properties of Weyl fermion states in reduced dimensions.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents a self-contained system for the robust utilization of
aerial robots in the autonomous exploration of cave environments to help human
explorers, first responders, and speleologists. The proposed system is
generally applicable to an arbitrary exploration task within an unknown and
unstructured subterranean environment and interconnects crucial robotic
subsystems to provide full autonomy of the robots. Such subsystems primarily
include mapping, path and trajectory planning, localization, control, and
decision making. Due to the diversity, complexity, and structural uncertainty
of natural cave environments, the proposed system allows for the possible use
of any arbitrary exploration strategy for a single robot, as well as for a
cooperating team. A multi-robot cooperation strategy that maximizes the limited
flight time of each aerial robot is proposed for exploration and search &amp;
rescue scenarios where the homing of all deployed robots back to an initial
location is not required The entire system is validated in a comprehensive
experimental analysis comprising of hours of flight time in a real-world cave
environment, as well as by hundreds of hours within a state-of-the-art virtual
testbed that was developed for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge robotic
competition. Among others, experimental results include multiple real-world
exploration flights traveling over 470 meters on a single battery in a
demanding unknown cave environment.

					<dc:description>  Spin and mass properties provide essential clues in distinguishing the
formation channels for coalescing binary black holes (BBHs). With a dedicated
non-parametric population model for the joint distributions of mass, spin
magnitude, and spin orientation of the black holes (BHs) in the coalescing
binaries, we find two distinct categories of BHs among the GWTC-3 events with
considerably different spin and mass distributions. One category, with a mass
ranging from $\sim 25M_\odot$ to $\sim 80M_\odot$, is distinguished by the high
spin-magnitudes and consistent with the (hierarchical) merger origin. The other
category, characterized by low spins, has a sharp mass cutoff at $\sim
40M_\odot$ ($&lt;56.8M_{\odot}$ at 90\% credible level), which is natural for the
stellar-collapse origin. In particular, such a mass cutoff is expected for the
pair-instability explosion of massive stars. The stellar-collapse category is
estimated to consist of $\sim 70\%$ filed binaries and $\sim 30\%$ dynamical
assembly from star clusters (mostly globular clusters); while the merger-origin
category may contain comparable amounts of events from the Active Galactic
Nuclei disks and star clusters.

					<dc:description>  There are various automotive applications that rely on correctly interpreting
point cloud data recorded with radar sensors. We present a deep learning
approach for histogram-based processing of such point clouds. Compared to
existing methods, the design of our approach is extremely simple: it boils down
to computing a point cloud histogram and passing it through a multi-layer
perceptron. Our approach matches and surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on
the task of automotive radar object type classification. It is also robust to
noise that often corrupts radar measurements, and can deal with missing
features of single radar reflections. Finally, the design of our approach makes
it more interpretable than existing methods, allowing insightful analysis of
its decisions.

					<dc:description>  This letter presents a self-contained system for robust deployment of
autonomous aerial vehicles in environments without access to global navigation
systems and with limited lighting conditions. The proposed system,
application-tailored for documentation in dark areas of large historical
monuments, uses a unique and reliable aerial platform with a multi-modal
lightweight sensory setup to acquire data in human-restricted areas with
adverse lighting conditions, especially in areas that are high above the
ground. The introduced localization method relies on an easy-to-obtain 3-D
point cloud of a historical building, while it copes with a lack of visible
light by fusing active laser-based sensors. The approach does not rely on any
external localization, or on a preset motion-capture system. This enables fast
deployment in the interiors of investigated structures while being
computationally undemanding enough to process data online, onboard an MAV
equipped with ordinary processing resources.
  The reliability of the system is analyzed, is quantitatively evaluated on a
set of aerial trajectories performed inside a real-world church, and is
deployed onto the aerial platform in the position control feedback loop to
demonstrate the reliability of the system in the safety-critical application of
historical monuments documentation.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this work we consider moments of exponential functionals of L\'{e}vy
processes on deterministic horizon. We derive two convolutional identities
regarding those moments. The first one relates the complex moments of general
exponential functional of L\'{e}vy process up to a deterministic time to those
of the dual one. The second convolutional identity links the complex moments of
the exponential functional of a general L\'{e}vy process to those of the
exponential functionals of its ascending/descending ladder heights taken on a
random horizon determined by the respective local times. As a consequence of
both we deduce a universal expression for the one half negative moment of the
exponential functional of symmetric L\'{e}vy process which is reminiscent of
the universality for the passage time of symmetric random walk. In this work,
under extremely mild conditions, we also obtain series expansion for the
complex moments (including those with negative real part) of the exponential
functionals of subordinators. This extends substantially previous results and
offers neat expressions for the negative real moments. In a special case, it
turns out that the Riemann zeta function is the minus first moment of the
exponential functional of Gamma subordinator indexed in time.

					<dc:description>  The assessment of sewer pipe systems is a highly important, but at the same
time cumbersome and error-prone task. We introduce an innovative system based
on single-shot structured light modules that facilitates the detection and
classification of spatial defects like jutting intrusions, spallings, or
misaligned joints. This system creates highly accurate 3D measurements with
sub-millimeter resolution of pipe surfaces and fuses them into a holistic 3D
model. The benefit of such a holistic 3D model is twofold: on the one hand, it
facilitates the accurate manual sewer pipe assessment, on the other, it
simplifies the detection of defects in downstream automatic systems as it
endows the input with highly accurate depth information. In this work, we
provide an extensive overview of the system and give valuable insights into our
design choices.

					<dc:description>  Channelling single-photon emission in multiple well-defined directions and
simultaneously controlling its polarization characteristics is highly desirable
for numerous quantum technology applications. We show that this can be achieved
by using quantum emitters (QEs) nonradiatively coupled to surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs), which are scattered into outgoing free-propagating waves by
appropriately designed metasurfaces. The QE-coupled metasurface design is based
on the scattering holography approach with radially diverging SPPs as reference
waves. Using holographic metasurfaces fabricated around nanodiamonds with
single Ge vacancy centers, we experimentally demonstrate on-chip integrated
efficient generation of two well-collimated single-photon beams propagating
along different 15-degree off-normal directions with orthogonal linear
polarizations.

					<dc:description>  Uplift modeling aims to estimate the treatment effect on individuals, widely
applied in the e-commerce platform to target persuadable customers and maximize
the return of marketing activities. Among the existing uplift modeling methods,
tree-based methods are adept at fitting increment and generalization, while
neural-network-based models excel at predicting absolute value and precision,
and these advantages have not been fully explored and combined. Also, the lack
of counterfactual sample pairs is the root challenge in uplift modeling. In
this paper, we proposed an uplift modeling framework based on Knowledge
Distillation and Sample Matching (KDSM). The teacher model is the uplift
decision tree (UpliftDT), whose structure is exploited to construct
counterfactual sample pairs, and the pairwise incremental prediction is treated
as another objective for the student model. Under the idea of multitask
learning, the student model can achieve better performance on generalization
and even surpass the teacher. Extensive offline experiments validate the
universality of different combinations of teachers and student models and the
superiority of KDSM measured against the baselines. In online A/B testing, the
cost of each incremental room night is reduced by 6.5\%.

					<dc:description>  We consider a population organised hierarchically with respect to size in
such a way that the growth rate of each individual depends only on the presence
of larger individuals. As a concrete example one might think of a forest, in
which the incidence of light on a tree (and hence how fast it grows) is
affected by shading of taller trees. The model is formulated as a delay
equation, more specifically a scalar renewal equation, for the population birth
rate. After discussing the well-posedness of the model, we analyse how many
stationary birth rates the equation can have in terms of the functional
parameters of the model. In particular we show that, under reasonable and
rather general assumptions, only one stationary birth rate can exist besides
the trivial one (associated to the state in which there are no individuals and
the population birth rate is zero). We give conditions for this non-trivial
stationary birth rate to exist and we analyse its stability using the principle
of linearised stability for delay equations. Finally we relate the results to
an alternative formulation of the model taking the form of a quasilinear
partial differential equation for the population size-density.

					<dc:description>  Learning from large-scale contrastive language-image pre-training like CLIP
has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but
it is still under-explored on the challenging few-shot action recognition
(FSAR) task. In this work, we aim to transfer the powerful multimodal knowledge
of CLIP to alleviate the inaccurate prototype estimation issue due to data
scarcity, which is a critical problem in low-shot regimes. To this end, we
present a CLIP-guided prototype modulating framework called CLIP-FSAR, which
consists of two key components: a video-text contrastive objective and a
prototype modulation. Specifically, the former bridges the task discrepancy
between CLIP and the few-shot video task by contrasting videos and
corresponding class text descriptions. The latter leverages the transferable
textual concepts from CLIP to adaptively refine visual prototypes with a
temporal Transformer. By this means, CLIP-FSAR can take full advantage of the
rich semantic priors in CLIP to obtain reliable prototypes and achieve accurate
few-shot classification. Extensive experiments on five commonly used benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and CLIP-FSAR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under various
settings. The source code and models will be publicly available at
https://github.com/alibaba-mmai-research/CLIP-FSAR.

					<dc:description>  Ecosystems are commonly organized into trophic levels -- organisms that
occupy the same level in a food chain (e.g., plants, herbivores, carnivores). A
fundamental question in theoretical ecology is how the interplay between
trophic structure, diversity, and competition shapes the properties of
ecosystems. To address this problem, we analyze a generalized Consumer Resource
Model with three trophic levels using the zero-temperature cavity method and
numerical simulations. We find that intra-trophic diversity gives rise to
``emergent competition'' between species within a trophic level due to
feedbacks mediated by other trophic levels. This emergent competition gives
rise to a crossover from a regime of top-down control (populations are limited
by predators) to a regime of bottom-up control (populations are limited by
primary producers) and is captured by a simple order parameter related to the
ratio of surviving species in different trophic levels. We show that our
theoretical results agree with empirical observations, suggesting that the
theoretical approach outlined here can be used to understand complex ecosystems
with multiple trophic levels.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks can learn powerful prior probability models for images,
as evidenced by the high-quality generations obtained with recent score-based
diffusion methods. But the means by which these networks capture complex global
statistical structure, apparently without suffering from the curse of
dimensionality, remain a mystery. To study this, we incorporate diffusion
methods into a multi-scale decomposition, reducing dimensionality by assuming a
stationary local Markov model for wavelet coefficients conditioned on
coarser-scale coefficients. We instantiate this model using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields, which enforce both the
stationarity and Markov properties. Global structures are captured using a CNN
with receptive fields covering the entire (but small) low-pass image. We test
this model on a dataset of face images, which are highly non-stationary and
contain large-scale geometric structures. Remarkably, denoising,
super-resolution, and image synthesis results all demonstrate that these
structures can be captured with significantly smaller conditioning
neighborhoods than required by a Markov model implemented in the pixel domain.
Our results show that score estimation for large complex images can be reduced
to low-dimensional Markov conditional models across scales, alleviating the
curse of dimensionality.

					<dc:description>  The description of deuteron-induced inclusive reactions has been an important
subject in direct nuclear reaction studies and nuclear data science. For
proton-induced inclusive processes, the semiclassical distorted wave model
(SCDW) is one of the most successful models based on quantum mechanics. We
improve SCDW for deuteron-induced inclusive processes and clarify the
importance of the proper treatment of the kinematics of the deuteron inside a
nucleus. The double differential cross section (DDX) of the inclusive
deuteron-emission process $(d,d^{\prime}x)$ is described by one-step SCDW. The
calculated DDXs of $(d,d^{\prime}x)$ reproduce experimental data by taking into
account the changes in the kinematics of the deuteron due to the distorting
potential, in the small energy-transfer region and at forward angles. It is
confirmed that the proper treatment of the changes in the kinematics of the
deuteron inside a nucleus is necessary to reproduce experimental data. The
effect of the changes on the DDX of $(d,d^{\prime}x)$ is significant compared
to the proton-induced inclusive process $(p,p^{\prime}x)$ because of the
stronger distortion effect on the deuteron.

					<dc:title>Non-intrusive data-driven reduced-order modeling for time-dependent

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Reduced-order models are indispensable for multi-query or real-time problems.
However, there are still many challenges to constructing efficient ROMs for
time-dependent parametrized problems. Using a linear reduced space is
inefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for
transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed
by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on
the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and
studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent
parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into
offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional
autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform
dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution
snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space.
The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent
space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode
decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space
for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first
utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation
techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter
value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical
tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen
full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately,
including transport-dominated problems.

					<dc:description>  The integration of large shares of wind and solar power into the power system
benefits from transmission network expansion. However, the construction of new
power lines requires long planning phases and is often delayed by citizen
protests. As a non-invasive alternative, Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) offers the
potential to leverage the existing grid by dynamically adjusting the
transmission line capacities to the prevailing weather conditions. In this
study, we present the first investment model that includes DLR in a large-scale
power system with real-world network data and a high temporal resolution. Using
Germany as an example, we show that a system-wide integration of DLR improves
the integration of existing and additional renewables while reducing grid
congestion. The evolving synergies between DLR and increased wind generation
result in total cost savings of about 3% of all system costs for a scenario
with 80% renewable power production, mainly due to reduced storage and solar
capacity needs. If considering a fully decarbonized electricity system, the
cost savings from DLR amount to up to 5.5% of the system costs, i.e. 4 billion
Euro per year. Our results underscore the importance of a rapid implementation
of DLR in power systems to support the energy transition and relieve grid
congestion.

					<dc:description>  Aim: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 raised problems of heart
murmur detection and related abnormal cardiac function identification from
phonocardiograms (PCGs). This work describes the novel approaches developed by
our team, Revenger, to solve these problems.
  Methods: PCGs were resampled to 1000 Hz, then filtered with a Butterworth
band-pass filter of order 3, cutoff frequencies 25 - 400 Hz, and z-score
normalized. We used the multi-task learning (MTL) method via hard parameter
sharing to train one neural network (NN) model for all the Challenge tasks. We
performed neural architecture searching among a set of network backbones,
including multi-branch convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SE-ResNets,
TResNets, simplified wav2vec2, etc.
  Based on a stratified splitting of the subjects, 20% of the public data was
left out as a validation set for model selection. The AdamW optimizer was
adopted, along with the OneCycle scheduler, to optimize the model weights.
  Results: Our murmur detection classifier received a weighted accuracy score
of 0.736 (ranked 14th out of 40 teams) and a Challenge cost score of 12944
(ranked 19th out of 39 teams) on the hidden validation set.
  Conclusion: We provided a practical solution to the problems of detecting
heart murmurs and providing clinical diagnosis suggestions from PCGs.

					<dc:description>  This article presents a unique framework for deploying decentralized and
infrastructure-independent swarms of homogeneous aerial vehicles in the real
world without explicit communication. This is a requirement in swarm research,
which anticipates that global knowledge and communication will not scale well
with the number of robots. The system architecture proposed in this article
employs the UVDAR technique to directly perceive the local neighborhood for
direct mutual localization of swarm members. The technique allows for
decentralization and high scalability of swarm systems, such as can be observed
in fish schools, bird flocks, or cattle herds. The bio-inspired swarming model
that has been developed is suited for real-world deployment of large particle
groups in outdoor and indoor environments with obstacles. The collective
behavior of the model emerges from a set of local rules based on direct
observation of the neighborhood using onboard sensors only. The model is
scalable, requires only local perception of agents and the environment, and
requires no communication among the agents. Apart from simulated scenarios, the
performance and usability of the entire framework is analyzed in several
real-world experiments with a fully-decentralized swarm of UAVs deployed in
outdoor conditions. To the best of our knowledge, these experiments are the
first deployment of decentralized bio-inspired compact swarms of UAVs without
the use of a communication network or shared absolute localization. The entire
system is available as open-source at https://github.com/ctu-mrs.

					<dc:description>  We consider a spinor domain wall embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime
with a nondiagonal metric. The corresponding plane symmetric solutions for
linear and nonlinear spinor fields with different parameters are obtained. It
is shown that in the general case the metric functions and spinor fields do not
possess $Z_2$ symmetry with respect to the domain wall. We study the angular
momentum density of the domain wall arising because of the presence of the
spinor field creating the wall. The properties of test fermions located on an
arbitrary domain wall are considered. The concepts of the ``second spin''
(arising due to the properties of the Lorentz group generators in a
five-dimensional spacetime) and of the ``second magnetic field'' (representing
the components $F_{i 5}$ of the electromagnetic field five-tensor) are
introduced. We find eigenspinors of the ``second spin'' and show that some of
them represent the Bell states. In the nonrelativistic limit we derive the
Pauli equation for the test fermions on the domain wall which contains an extra
term describing the interaction of a spin-$1/2$ particle with the ``second
magnetic field''; this allows the possibility of an experimental verification
of the existence of extra dimensions.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new approach to the theory of normal forms for Hamiltonian
systems near a non-resonant elliptic singular point. We consider the space of
all Hamiltonian functions with such an equilibrium position at the origin and
construct a differential equation in this space. Solutions of this equation
move Hamiltonian functions towards their normal forms. Shifts along the flow of
this equation correspond to canonical coordinate changes. So, we have a
continuous normalization procedure. The formal aspect of the theory presents no
difficulties. The analytic aspect and the problems of convergence of series are
as usual non-trivial.

					<dc:title>Modified Green-hyperbolic operators</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Fewster, Christopher J.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Green-hyperbolic operators - partial differential operators on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes that (together with their formal duals) possess advanced
and retarded Green operators - play an important role in many areas of
mathematical physics. Here, we study modifications of Green-hyperbolic
operators by the addition of a possibly nonlocal operator acting within a
compact subset $K$ of spacetime, and seek corresponding '$K$-nonlocal'
generalised Green operators. Assuming the modification depends holomorphically
on a parameter, conditions are given under which $K$-nonlocal Green operators
exist for all parameter values, with the possible exception of a discrete set.
The exceptional points occur precisely where the modified operator admits
nontrivial smooth homogeneous solutions that have past- or future-compact
support. Fredholm theory is used to relate the dimensions of these spaces to
those corresponding to the formal dual operator, switching the roles of future
and past. The $K$-nonlocal Green operators are shown to depend holomorphically
on the parameter in the topology of bounded convergence on maps between
suitable Sobolev spaces, or between suitable spaces of smooth functions. An
application to the LU factorisation of systems of equations is described.

					<dc:description>  Action Unit (AU) detection aims at automatically caracterizing facial
expressions with the muscular activations they involve. Its main interest is to
provide a low-level face representation that can be used to assist higher level
affective computing tasks learning. Yet, it is a challenging task. Indeed, the
available databases display limited face variability and are imbalanced toward
neutral expressions. Furthermore, as AU involve subtle face movements they are
difficult to annotate so that some of the few provided datapoints may be
mislabeled. In this work, we aim at exploiting label smoothing ability to
mitigate noisy examples impact by reducing confidence [1]. However, applying
label smoothing as it is may aggravate imbalance-based pre-existing
under-confidence issue and degrade performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose Robin Hood Label Smoothing (RHLS). RHLS principle is to restrain label
smoothing confidence reduction to the majority class. In that extent, it
alleviates both the imbalance-based over-confidence issue and the negative
impact of noisy majority class examples. From an experimental standpoint, we
show that RHLS provides a free performance improvement in AU detection. In
particular, by applying it on top of a modern multi-task baseline we get
promising results on BP4D and outperform state-of-the-art methods on DISFA.

					<dc:description>  The success of large-scale contrastive vision-language pretraining (CLIP) has
benefited both visual recognition and multimodal content understanding. The
concise design brings CLIP the advantage in inference efficiency against other
vision-language models with heavier cross-attention fusion layers, making it a
popular choice for a wide spectrum of downstream tasks. However, CLIP does not
explicitly capture the hierarchical nature of high-level and fine-grained
semantics conveyed in images and texts, which is arguably critical to
vision-language understanding and reasoning. To this end, we equip both the
visual and language branches in CLIP with hierarchy-aware attentions, namely
Hierarchy-aware CLIP (HiCLIP), to progressively discover semantic hierarchies
layer-by-layer from both images and texts in an unsupervised manner. As a
result, such hierarchical aggregation significantly improves the cross-modal
alignment. To demonstrate the advantages of HiCLIP, we conduct qualitative
analysis on its unsupervised hierarchy induction during inference, as well as
extensive quantitative experiments on both visual recognition and
vision-language downstream tasks.

					<dc:description>  We study, in the context of the three-dimensional ${\cal N}=6$
Chern-Simons-matter (ABJM) theory, the infrared-finite functions that result
from performing $L-1$ loop integrations over the $L$-loop integrand of the
logarithm of the four-particle scattering amplitude. Our starting point are the
integrands obtained from the recently proposed all-loop projected amplituhedron
for the ABJM theory. Organizing them in terms of negative geometries ensures
that no divergences occur upon integration if at least one loop variable is
left unintegrated. We explicitly perform the integrations up to $L=3$, finding
both parity-even and -odd terms. Moreover, we discuss a prescription to compute
the cusp anomalous dimension $\Gamma_{\rm cusp}$ of ABJM in terms of the
integrated negative geometries, and we use it to reproduce the first
non-trivial order of $\Gamma_{\rm cusp}$. Finally, we show that the leading
singularities that characterize the integrated results are conformally
invariant.

					<dc:description>  A geometric $t$-spanner for a set $S$ of $n$ point sites is an edge-weighted
graph for which the (weighted) distance between any two sites $p,q \in S$ is at
most $t$ times the original distance between $p$ and $q$. We study geometric
$t$-spanners for point sets in a constrained two-dimensional environment $P$.
In such cases, the edges of the spanner may have non-constant complexity.
Hence, we introduce a novel spanner property: the spanner complexity, that is,
the total complexity of all edges in the spanner. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ point
sites in a simple polygon $P$ with $m$ vertices. We present an algorithm to
construct, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and fixed integer $k \geq 1$, a
$(2k + \varepsilon)$-spanner with complexity $O(mn^{1/k} + n\log^2 n)$ in
$O(n\log^2n + m\log n + K)$ time, where $K$ denotes the output complexity. When
we consider sites in a polygonal domain $P$ with holes, we can construct such a
$(2k+\varepsilon)$-spanner of similar complexity in $O(n^2 \log m + nm\log m +
K)$ time. Additionally, for any constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ and integer
constant $t \geq 2$, we show a lower bound for the complexity of any
$(t-\varepsilon)$-spanner of $\Omega(mn^{1/(t-1)} + n)$.

					<dc:description>  Pseudo-Labeling has emerged as a simple yet effective technique for
semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, the inevitable noise problem
in pseudo-labels significantly degrades the performance of SSOD methods. Recent
advances effectively alleviate the classification noise in SSOD, while the
localization noise which is a non-negligible part of SSOD is not
well-addressed. In this paper, we analyse the localization noise from the
generation and learning phases, and propose two strategies, namely pseudo-label
correction and noise-unaware learning. For pseudo-label correction, we
introduce a multi-round refining method and a multi-vote weighting method. The
former iteratively refines the pseudo boxes to improve the stability of
predictions, while the latter smoothly self-corrects pseudo boxes by weighing
the scores of surrounding jittered boxes. For noise-unaware learning, we
introduce a loss weight function that is negatively correlated with the
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the regression task, which pulls the predicted
boxes closer to the object and improves localization accuracy. Our proposed
method, Pseudo-label Correction and Learning (PCL), is extensively evaluated on
the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks. On MS COCO, PCL outperforms the
supervised baseline by 12.16, 12.11, and 9.57 mAP and the recent SOTA
(SoftTeacher) by 3.90, 2.54, and 2.43 mAP under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeling
ratios, respectively. On PASCAL VOC, PCL improves the supervised baseline by
5.64 mAP and the recent SOTA (Unbiased Teacherv2) by 1.04 mAP on AP$^{50}$.

					<dc:description>  We construct examples of smooth periodic solutions to the Magnetohydrodynamic

to be impossible in the ideal case (resistivity = 0). In the resistive case the

implications, being responsible for many dynamic phenomena in astrophysics. The
construction is a simplified proof of [3] and in addition we consider the case
of the forced system.

					<dc:description>  Graph neural networks trained on large crystal structure databases are
extremely effective in replacing ab initio calculations in the discovery and
characterization of materials. However, crystal structure datasets comprising
millions of materials exist only for the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
functional. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
to extend these models to other density functionals. We show that pre-training
significantly reduces the size of the dataset required to achieve chemical
accuracy and beyond. We also analyze in detail the relationship between the
transfer-learning performance and the size of the datasets used for the initial
training of the model and transfer learning. We confirm a linear dependence of
the error on the size of the datasets on a log-log scale, with a similar slope
for both training and the pre-training datasets. This shows that further
increasing the size of the pre-training dataset, i.e. performing additional
calculations with a low-cost functional, is also effective, through transfer

					<dc:description>  When wireless communication signals impinge on a moving human they are
affected by micro-Doppler. A passive receiver of the resulting signals can
calculate the spectrogram that produces different signatures depending on the
human activity. This constitutes a significant privacy breach when the human is
unaware of it. This paper presents a methodology for preventing this when we
want to do so by injecting into the transmitted signal frequency variations
that obfuscate the micro-Doppler signature. We assume a system that uses
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and a passive receiver that
estimates the spectrogram based on the instantaneous channel state information
(CSI). We analyze the impact of our approach on the received signal and we
propose two strategies that do not affect the demodulation of the digital
communication signal at the intended receiver. To evaluate the performance of
our approach we use an IEEE 802.11-based OFDM system and realistic human signal
reflection models.

					<dc:description>  The nonholonomic dynamics can be described by the so-called nonholonomic
bracket in the constrained submanifold, which is a non-integrable modification
of the Poisson bracket of the ambient space, in this case, of the canonical
bracket in the cotangent bundle of the configuration manifold. This bracket was
defined by Cantrijn et al. and Ibort et al., although there was already some
particular and less direct definition. On the other hand, another bracket, also
called noholonomic, was defined using the description of the problem in terms
of almost Lie algebroids. Recently, reviewing two older papers by R. J. Eden,
we have defined a new bracket which we call Eden bracket. In the present paper,
we prove that these three brackets coincide. Moreover, the description of the
nonholonomic bracket \`a la Eden has allowed us to make important advances in
the study of Hamilton-Jacobi theory and the quantization of nonholonomic
systems.

					<dc:description>  Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods for large-scale scene modeling
require days of training using multiple GPUs, hindering their applications in
scenarios with limited computing resources. Despite fast optimization NeRF
variants have been proposed based on the explicit dense or hash grid features,
their effectivenesses are mainly demonstrated in object-scale scene
representation. In this paper, we point out that the low feature resolution in
explicit representation is the bottleneck for large-scale unbounded scene
representation. To address this problem, we introduce a new and efficient
hybrid feature representation for NeRF that fuses the 3D hash-grids and
high-resolution 2D dense plane features. Compared with the dense-grid
representation, the resolution of a dense 2D plane can be scaled up more
efficiently. Based on this hybrid representation, we propose a fast
optimization NeRF variant, called GP-NeRF, that achieves better rendering
results while maintaining a compact model size. Extensive experiments on
multiple large-scale unbounded scene datasets show that our model can converge
in 1.5 hours using a single GPU while achieving results comparable to or even
better than the existing method that requires about one day's training with 8
GPUs.

					<dc:description>  The ability to solve problems is a hallmark of intelligence and has been an
enduring goal in AI. AI systems that can create programs as solutions to
problems or assist developers in writing programs can increase productivity and
make programming more accessible. Recently, pre-trained large language models
have shown impressive abilities in generating new codes from natural language
descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and
retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has
often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a
few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level and in many
cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases
the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical
overlap rather than actual execution whereas semantic similarity (or
equivalence) of two code segments depends only on their ``execution
similarity'', i.e., being able to get the same output for a given input.

					<dc:description>  Recently, several very effective neural approaches for single-channel speech
separation have been presented in the literature. However, due to the size and
complexity of these models, their use on low-resource devices, e.g. for hearing
aids, and earphones, is still a challenge and established solutions are not
available yet. Although approaches based on either pruning or compressing
neural models have been proposed, the design of a model architecture suitable
for a certain application domain often requires heuristic procedures not easily
portable to different low-resource platforms. Given the modular nature of the
well-known Conv-Tasnet speech separation architecture, in this paper we
consider three parameters that directly control the overall size of the model,
namely: the number of residual blocks, the number of repetitions of the
separation blocks and the number of channels in the depth-wise convolutions,
and experimentally evaluate how they affect the speech separation performance.
In particular, experiments carried out on the Libri2Mix show that the number of
dilated 1D-Conv blocks is the most critical parameter and that the usage of
extra-dilation in the residual blocks allows reducing the performance drop.

					<dc:description>  To meet carbon emission reduction goals in line with the Paris agreement,
planning resilient and sustainable energy systems has never been more
important. In the building sector, particularly, strategic urban energy
planning engenders large optimization problems across multiple spatiotemporal
scales leading to necessary system scope simplifications. This has resulted in
disconnected system scales, namely, building occupants and smart-city energy
networks. This paper intends on bridging these disjointed scales to secure both
resilient and more energy-efficient urban planning thanks to a holistic
approach. The intent is to assess the aggregated impact of user behavior
stochasticities on optimal urban energy planning. To this end, a stochastic
energy community sizing and operation problem is designed, encompassing
multi-level utilities founded on energy hub concepts for improved energy and
carbon emission efficiencies. To secure the scalability of our approach, an
organic spatial problem distribution suitable for field deployment is put
forth, validated by a proof of concept. Uncertainty factors affecting urban
energy planning are particularly examined through a local sensitivity analysis,
namely, economic, climate, and occupant-behavior uncertainties. Founded on
historical measurements a typical Dutch energy community composed of 41
residential buildings is designed. Results disclose a fast-converging
distributed stochastic problem, where boilers are showcased as the preferred
heating utility, and distributed renewable energy and storage systems were
identified as unprofitable for the community. Occupant behavior was
particularly exposed as the leading uncertainty factor impacting energy
community planning. This demonstrates the relevance and value of our approach
in connecting occupants to cities for improved, and more resilient, urban
energy planning strategies.

					<dc:description>  We present predictions for the rapidity-differential cross sections of
exclusive $\Upsilon$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of
lead ions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We work in the framework of
collinear factorization at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD,
modeling the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the Shuvaev
transform of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). While the effects
due to the GPD modeling turn out to be small, the direct NLO predictions still
carry significant nPDF-originating uncertainties and depend strongly on the
choices of the factorization and renormalization scales. To tame the scale
dependence and to account for the fact that the NLO calculations generally
underpredict the photoproduction measurements on protons, we also present
alternative, data-driven predictions. In this approach the underlying
photoproduction cross sections on lead are found by combining their nuclear
modifications calculated at NLO with the measured photoproduction cross
sections on protons. The data-driven strategy reduces the uncertainties
associated with the scale choices, and essentially eliminates the effects of
GPD modeling thereby leaving the cross sections sensitive mainly to the input
nPDFs. Our estimates indicate that the process is measurable in ${\rm Pb}+{\rm
Pb}$ collisions at the LHC.

					<dc:description>  Plastic scintillators have become increasingly important in particle physics
for time-of-flight and calorimetry measurements. Their light yield and the
possibility of customizing their geometry make them also attractive for the
construction of active vetoes in rare event physics experiments. For this
purpose, some commercial plastic scintillators (purchased from Eljen
Technology) were tested in cryogenic environments (liquid nitrogen and liquid
helium). Their relative light yield was estimated by comparing the data
acquired at room temperature with those acquired at cryogenic temperatures.
Finally, estimates of the variation of the light yield at cryogenic
temperatures were obtained.

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We introduce a widely applicable tensor network-based framework for
developing reduced order models describing wall-bounded fluid flows. As a
paradigmatic example, we consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
and the lid-driven cavity in two spatial dimensions. We benchmark our solution
against published reference data for low Reynolds numbers and find excellent
agreement. In addition, we investigate the short-time dynamics of the flow at
high Reynolds numbers. The tensor network algorithm requires at most 3.4\% of
the number of variables parametrising the solution obtained by direct numerical
simulation, and achieves a five-fold speedup compared to direct numerical
simulation on similar hardware. We represent the velocity components by matrix
product states and find that the bond dimension is approximately independent of
the grid size. This behaviour is akin to area laws in quantum physics and shows
that the numerical complexity of our algorithm scales logarithmically with the
number of grid points. Our approach is readily transferable to other flows, and
paves the way towards quantum computational fluid dynamics in complex
geometries.

					<dc:creator>Wu, D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Zhang, J.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Plasma Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In the double-cone ignition (DCI) inertial confinement fusion scheme, head-on
collision of high density plasma jets is one of the most distinguished feature
when compared with other schemes. However, the application of traditional
hydrodynamic simulation methods become limited. To overcome such limitations,
we propose a new simulation method for large-scale high density plasmas. This
method takes advantages of modern particle-in-cell simulation techniques and
binary Monte Carlo collisions, including both long-range collective
electromagnetic fields and short-range particle-particle interactions.
Especially, in this method, the restrictions of simulation grid size and time
step, which usually appear in a fully kinetic description, are eliminated. In
addition, collisional coupling and state-dependent coefficients are also
removed in this method. The correctness and robustness of the new simulation
method are verified, by comparing with fully kinetic simulations at small
scales and purely hydrodynamic simulations at large scale. Following the
conceptual design of the DCI scheme, the colliding process of two plasma jets
with initial density of 100 g/cc, initial thermal temperature of 70 eV, and
counter-propagating velocity at 300 km/s is investigated using this new method.
Quantitative values, including density increment, increased plasma temperature,
confinement time at stagnation and conversion efficiency from the colliding
kinetic energy to thermal energy, are obtained. These values agree with the
recent experimental measurements at a reasonable range.

					<dc:description>  Recent progress in large language code models (LLCMs) has led to a dramatic
surge in the use of software development. Nevertheless, it is widely known that
training a well-performed LLCM requires a plethora of workforce for collecting
the data and high quality annotation. Additionally, the training dataset may be
proprietary (or partially open source to the public), and the training process
is often conducted on a large-scale cluster of GPUs with high costs. Inspired
by the recent success of imitation attacks in stealing computer vision and
natural language models, this work launches the first imitation attack on
LLCMs: by querying a target LLCM with carefully-designed queries and collecting
the outputs, the adversary can train an imitation model that manifests close
behavior with the target LLCM. We systematically investigate the effectiveness
of launching imitation attacks under different query schemes and different LLCM
tasks. We also design novel methods to polish the LLCM outputs, resulting in an
effective imitation training process. We summarize our findings and provide
lessons harvested in this study that can help better depict the attack surface
of LLCMs. Our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on
imitation attacks and defenses in deep neural models, particularly in the
domain of code related tasks.

					<dc:description>  We describe the families of minimal rational curves on any complete symmetric
variety, and the corresponding varieties of minimal rational tangents (VMRT).
In particular, we prove that these varieties are homogeneous and that for
non-exceptional irreducible wonderful varieties, there is a unique family of
minimal rational curves, and hence a unique VMRT. We relate these results to
the restricted root system of the associated symmetric space. In particular we
answer by the negative a question of Hwang: for certain Fano wonderful
symmetric varieties, the VMRT has two connected components.

assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We describe an
iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent to minimize the IL cost
function. A reformulation of the problem provides a geometric interpretation
and shows interesting connections with envelope precoding and phase-only
zero-forcing beamforming problems. As a result of this analysis, we derive a
set of necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for a phase-optimized RIS to
be able to perfectly cancel the interference on the $K$-user MIMO IC.

					<dc:title>Using Spoofax to Support Online Code Navigation</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Mosses, Peter D.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Spoofax is a language workbench. A Spoofax language specification generally
includes name resolution: the analysis of bindings between definitions and
references. When browsing code in the specified language using Spoofax, the
bindings appear as hyperlinks, supporting precise name-based code navigation.
However, Spoofax cannot be used for browsing code in online repositories.
  This paper is about a toolchain that uses Spoofax to generate hyperlinked
twins of code repositories. These generated artefacts support the same precise
code navigation as Spoofax, and can be browsed online. The technique has been
prototyped on the CBS (Component-Based Semantics) specification language
developed by the PLanCompS project, but could be used on any language after
specifying its name resolution in Spoofax.

					<dc:title>The calculation of the probability density of a strictly stable law at

					<dc:subject>60E07</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The article is devoted to the problem of calculating the probability density
of a strictly stable law at $x\to\infty$. To solve this problem, it was
proposed to use the expansion of the probability density in a power series. A
representation of the probability density in the form of a power series and an
estimate for the remainder term was obtained. This power series is convergent
in the case $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and asymptotic at $x\to\infty$ in the case
$1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. The case $\alpha=1$ was considered separately. It was shown that
in the case $\alpha=1$ the obtained power series was convergent for any $|x|&gt;1$
at $N\to\infty$. It was also shown that in this case it was convergent to the
density of $g(x,1,\theta)$. An estimate of the threshold coordinate
$x_\varepsilon^N$, was obtained which determines the range of applicability of
the resulting expansion of the probability density in a power series. It was
shown that in the domain $|x|\geqslant x_\varepsilon^N$ this power series could
be used to calculate the probability density.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we present a variational inference algorithm that decomposes a
signal into multiple groups of related spectral lines. The spectral lines in
each group are associated with a group parameter common to all spectral lines
within the group. The proposed algorithm jointly estimates the group
parameters, the number of spetral lines within a group, and the number of
groups exploiting a Bernoulli-Gamma-Gaussian hierarchical prior model which
promotes sparse solutions. Aiming to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO),
variational inference provides analytic approximations of the posterior
probability density functions (PDFs) and also gives estimates of the additional
model parameters such as the measurement noise variance. While the activation
variables of the groups and the associated group parameters (such as
fundamental frequencies and the corresponding higher order harmonics) are
estimated as point estimates, the remaining parameters such as the complex
amplitudes of the spectral lines and their precision parameters are estimated
as approximate posterior PDFs. We demonstrate the versatility and performance
of the proposed algorithm on three different inference problems. In particular,
the proposed algorithm is applied to the multi-pitch estimation problem, the
radar signal-based extended object estimation problem, and variational mode
decomposition (VMD) using synthetic measurements and to real multi-pitch
estimation problem using the Bach-10 dataset. The results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and pre-trained
algorithms on all three inference problems.

					<dc:description>  Steering torque is a very important quantity for the driver feeling. In fact,
it gives the driver an idea of the road adherence condition during driving.
Several models have been developed to simulate shear forces at the contact
patch, most of them are based on semi-empirical tire models that account for
slip and slip angles. They have good reliability when speed is high enough. At
very low speed, like in parking, these models suffer from both reliability and
numerical issues. This paper presents a model to compute the steering moment
due to contact-patch friction at any longitudinal speed including pivot
steering condition. In particular, it supplements the pivot steering model with
a novel exponential decay of moment model to simulate for various rolling
speeds of the wheel. The decay rate found to be dependent upon contact-patch
geometry and rolling speed.

					<dc:description>  The proliferation of deep neural networks in various domains has seen an
increased need for the interpretability of these models, especially in
scenarios where fairness and trust are as important as model performance. A lot
of independent work is being carried out to: i) analyze what linguistic and
non-linguistic knowledge is learned within these models, and ii) highlight the
salient parts of the input. We present NxPlain, a web application that provides
an explanation of a model's prediction using latent concepts. NxPlain discovers
latent concepts learned in a deep NLP model, provides an interpretation of the
knowledge learned in the model, and explains its predictions based on the used
concepts. The application allows users to browse through the latent concepts in
an intuitive order, letting them efficiently scan through the most salient
concepts with a global corpus level view and a local sentence-level view. Our
tool is useful for debugging, unraveling model bias, and for highlighting
spurious correlations in a model. A hosted demo is available here:

					<dc:creator>Banik, Prabir</dc:creator>

					<dc:description>  Recent ultrahigh energy gamma-ray observations by the HAWC up to 100 TeV and
LHAASO observatories up to 1.4 PeV energies from the direction of Fermi-LAT
4FGL source 4FGL J2028.6+4110e (Cygnus Cocoon), are indicative of a hadronic
origin over a leptonic process for their creation. The IceCube Neutrino
Observatory has reported IceCube-201120A, a neutrino event coming from the same
direction, suggesting that the Cygnus Cocoon may correspond to one of the most
plausible sources of high-energy cosmic rays. The apparent relationship of the
neutrino event with the observed ultra high energy gamma-rays from Cygnus
Cocoon is investigated in this work to study if it can be explained
consistently in hadronic interactions of accelerated cosmic rays with ambient
matter. Our findings reveal that leptonic mechanisms, together with pure
hadronic mechanisms, make a considerable contribution to the understanding of
the total electromagnetic spectrum as well as the observed neutrino event. The
estimate of expected muon neutrino events from the Cygnus cocoon agrees with
the one muon neutrino event detected so far in IceCube multi-year observations.
Thus, our results are indicative of the potential of the Cygnus Cocoon to be a
galactic cosmic ray source capable of accelerating at least up to PeV energies.

					<dc:description>  An energy-based model (EBM) is a popular generative framework that offers
both explicit density and architectural flexibility, but training them is
difficult since it is often unstable and time-consuming. In recent years,
various training techniques have been developed, e.g., better divergence
measures or stabilization in MCMC sampling, but there often exists a large gap
between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs in terms of generation
quality. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework for
improving EBMs via contrastive representation learning (CRL). To be specific,
we consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true
underlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs
to understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM
training significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also
design a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of
data and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods
(e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques),
even with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show
conditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs
as their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training. The
code is available at https://github.com/hankook/CLEL.

					<dc:description>  Online real estate platforms are gaining increasing popularity, where a
central issue is to match brokers with clients for potential housing
transactions. Mainstream platforms match brokers via top-k recommendation. Yet
we observe through extensive data analysis that such top-k recommendation tends
to overload the top brokers, which notably degrades their service quality. In
this paper, we propose to avoid such overloading in broker matching via the
paradigm shift from recommendation to assignment. To this end, we design
learned assignment with contextual bandits (LACB), a data-driven capacity-aware
assignment scheme for broker matching which estimates broker-specific workload
capacity in an online fashion and assigns brokers to clients from a global
perspective to maximize the overall service quality. Extensive evaluations on
synthetic and real-world datasets from an industrial online real estate
platform validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.

					<dc:description>  Dark matter clusters on all scales, therefore it is expected that even
substructure should host its own substructure. Using the Extragalactic Distance
Database, we searched for dwarf galaxy satellites of dwarf galaxies, i.e.
satellite-of-satellite galaxies, corresponding to these
substructures-of-substructure. Going through HST data of 117 dwarf galaxies, we
report the discovery of a dwarf galaxy around the ultra-diffuse M96 companion
M96-DF6 at 10 Mpc. Modelling its structural parameters, we find that it is an
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy which is 135 times fainter than its host. Based on its
close projection to M96-DF6 it is unlikely that their association occurs by
chance. We compare the luminosity ratio of this and three other known
satellite-of-satellite systems with results from two different cosmological
sets of CDM simulations. For the observed stellar mass range of the central
dwarf galaxies, the simulated dwarfs have a higher luminosity ratio between the
central dwarf and its first satellite ($\approx$10'000) than observed
($\approx$100), excluding the LMC system. No simulated dwarf analog at these
observed stellar masses has the observed luminosity ratio. This cannot be due
to missing resolution, because it is the brightest subhalos that are missing.
This may indicate that there is a satellite-of-satellite (SoS) problem for CDM
in the stellar mass range between 10$^6$ and 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ - the regime of
the classical dwarf galaxies. However, simulated dwarf models at both a lower
($&lt;10^6$ M$_\odot$) and higher ($&gt;10^8$ M$_\odot$) stellar mass have comparable
luminosity ratios. For the higher stellar mass systems, the LMC system is
reproduced by simulations, for the lower stellar masses, no observed SoS system
has been observed to date. More observations and simulations of SoS systems are
needed to assess whether the luminosity ratio is at odds with CDM.

					<dc:description>  Computational astrophysics routinely combines grid-adaptive capabilities with
modern shock-capturing, high resolution spatio-temporal schemes on
multi-dimensional hydro- and magnetohydrodynamics. We provide an update on
developments within the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code. With online documentation,
the MPI-AMRVAC 3.0 release includes several added equation sets, and many
options to explore and quantify the influence of implementation details.
Showcasing this on a variety of hydro and MHD tests, we document new modules of
interest for state-of-the-art solar applications. Test cases address how higher
order reconstructions impact long term simulations of shear layers, with and
without gas-dust coupling, how runaway radiative losses transit to intricate
multi-temperature, multi-phase dynamics, and how different flavors of
spatio-temporal schemes and magnetic monopole control produce consistent MHD
results in combination with adaptive meshes. We demonstrate Super-Time-Stepping
strategies for specific parabolic terms and give details on all implemented
Implicit-Explicit integrators. A new magnetofrictional module can be used for
computing force-free magnetic fields or for data-driven time-dependent
evolutions, while the Regularized-Biot-Savart-Law approach can insert fluxropes
in 3D domains. Synthetic observations of 3D MHD simulations can be rendered
on-the-fly, or in post-processing, in many spectral wavebands. A particle
module and a generic fieldline tracing, compatible with the hierarchical
meshes, can be used to sample information at prescribed locations, to follow
dynamics of charged particles, or realize two-way coupled simulations between
MHD setups and field-aligned non-thermal processes. Highlighting the latest
additions and various technical aspects, our open-source strategy welcomes any
further code usage, contribution, or spin-off development.

					<dc:description>  We consider a deep matrix factorization model of covariance matrices trained
with the Bures-Wasserstein distance. While recent works have made important
advances in the study of the optimization problem for overparametrized low-rank
matrix approximation, much emphasis has been placed on discriminative settings
and the square loss. In contrast, our model considers another interesting type
of loss and connects with the generative setting. We characterize the critical
points and minimizers of the Bures-Wasserstein distance over the space of
rank-bounded matrices. For low-rank matrices the Hessian of this loss can
theoretically blow up, which creates challenges to analyze convergence of
optimizaton methods. We establish convergence results for gradient flow using a
smooth perturbative version of the loss and convergence results for finite step
size gradient descent under certain assumptions on the initial weights.

					<dc:description>  Deep variational autoencoders for image and video compression have gained
significant attraction in the recent years, due to their potential to offer
competitive or better compression rates compared to the decades long
traditional codecs such as AVC, HEVC or VVC. However, because of complexity and
energy consumption, these approaches are still far away from practical usage in
industry. More recently, implicit neural representation (INR) based codecs have
emerged, and have lower complexity and energy usage to classical approaches at
decoding. However, their performances are not in par at the moment with
state-of-the-art methods. In this research, we first show that INR based image
codec has a lower complexity than VAE based approaches, then we propose several
improvements for INR-based image codec and outperformed baseline model by a
large margin.

					<dc:description>  State estimation allows to monitor power networks, exploiting field
measurements to derive the most likely grid state. In the literature,
measurement errors are usually assumed to follow zero-mean Gaussian
distributions; however, it has been shown that this assumption often does not
hold. One such example is when considering pseudo-measurements. In distribution
networks, a significant amount of pseudo-measurements might be necessary, due
to the scarcity of real-time measurements. In this paper, a state estimator is
presented which allows to model measurement uncertainty with any continuous
distribution, without approximations. This becomes possible by writing state
estimation as a general maximum-likelihood estimation-based constrained
optimization problem. To realistically describe distribution networks,
three-phase unbalanced power flow equations are used. Results are presented
that illustrate the differences in accuracy and computational effort between
different uncertainty modeling methods, for the IEEE European Low Voltage Test
Feeder.

					<dc:description>  The phase transition calculations are utilized for an in-depth understanding
of the thermodynamics of the deconfinement transition to perform the best
analysis of the QCD phase diagram. The phenomenological justifications for a
mathematical approach to constructing the phase transition are found based on
the properties of hadronic matter at low densities as well as quark matter at
high densities. We modify both the quark matter equation of state by confining
effects at low densities and the hadronic matter equation of state by excluded
volume effects at higher densities. Over the intermediate densities, the
transition from the hadronic phase to the quark phase is modified by the
surface tension between to phases. The results are in agreement with the
observational constraints of neutron stars.

					<dc:description>  Consider a group of autonomous mobile computational entities called robots.
The robots move in the Euclidean plane and operate according to synchronous
$Look$-$Compute$-$Move$ cycles. The computational capabilities of the robots
under the four traditional models $\{ \mathcal{OBLOT},\ \mathcal{FSTA},\
\mathcal{FCOM},\ \mathcal{LUMI} \} $ have been extensively investigated both
when the robots had unlimited amount of energy and when the robots were
energy-constrained.
  In both the above cases, the robots had full visibility. In this paper, this
assumption is removed, i.e., we assume that the robots can view up to a
constant radius $V_r$ from their position (the $V_r$ is same for all the
robots) and, investigates what impact it has on its computational capabilities.
  We first study whether the restriction imposed on the visibility has any
impact at all, i.e., under a given model and scheduler does there exist any
problem which cannot be solved by a robot having limited visibility but can be
solved by a robot with full visibility. We find that the answer to the question
in general turns out to be positive. Next we try to get an idea that under a
given model, which of the two factors, $Visibility$ or $Synchronicity$ is more
powerful and conclude that a definite conclusion cannot be drawn. We restrict
our investigations to $\{ \mathcal{OBLOT},\ \mathcal{FSTA},\ \mathcal{FCOM} \}$
models and to synchronous schedulers only. The results in $\mathcal{LUMI}$
model is yet to be determined.

					<dc:description>  Large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate strong
zero-shot transfer capability in many discriminative tasks. Their adaptation to
zero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing
interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the
existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the
encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a
simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a
lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient
and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,
easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require
end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the
text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix
embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but
at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.
The modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models
that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix
embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We
project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the
projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the
projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality
descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap
outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods
on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new paradigm for Belief Change in which the new information is
represented as sets of models, while the agent's body of knowledge is
represented as a finite set of formulae, that is, a finite base. The focus on
finiteness is crucial when we consider limited agents and reasoning algorithms.
Moreover, having the input as arbitrary set of models is more general than the
usual treatment of formulae as input. In this setting, we define new Belief
Change operations akin to traditional expansion and contraction, and we
identify the rationality postulates that emerge due to the finite
representability requirement. We also analyse different logics concerning
compatibility with our framework.

					<dc:description>  We elaborate on aspects of a new positive geometry proposed recently, which
was conjectured to be the four-point amplituhedron for ABJM theory. We study
generalized unitarity cuts from the geometry, and in particular we prove that
(1) the four-point integrand satisfies perturbative unitarity (or optical
theorem) to all loops, which follows directly from the geometry, and (2)
vanishing cuts involving odd-point amplitudes follow from the ``bipartite&quot;
nature of the associated ``negative geometries&quot;, which justifies their
appearance in ABJM theory. We also take a first step in integrating the forms
of these negative geometries and obtain an infrared-finite quantity up to two
loops, from which we extract the cusp anomalous dimension at leading order.

					<dc:description>  We consider the scenario of deep clustering, in which the available prior
knowledge is limited. In this scenario, few existing state-of-the-art deep
clustering methods can perform well for both non-complex topology and complex
topology datasets. To address the problem, we propose a constraint utilizing
symmetric InfoNCE, which helps an objective of deep clustering method in the
scenario train the model so as to be efficient for not only non-complex
topology but also complex topology datasets. Additionally, we provide several
theoretical explanations of the reason why the constraint can enhances
performance of deep clustering methods. To confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed constraint, we introduce a deep clustering method named MIST, which is
a combination of an existing deep clustering method and our constraint. Our
numerical experiments via MIST demonstrate that the constraint is effective. In
addition, MIST outperforms other state-of-the-art deep clustering methods for
most of the commonly used ten benchmark datasets.

					<dc:description>  Uncertainty estimation is crucial in safety-critical settings such as
automated driving as it provides valuable information for several downstream
tasks including high-level decision-making and path planning. In this work, we
propose EvCenterNet, a novel uncertainty-aware 2D object detection framework
utilizing evidential learning to directly estimate both classification and
regression uncertainties. To employ evidential learning for object detection,
we devise a combination of evidential and focal loss functions for the sparse
heatmap inputs. We introduce class-balanced weighting for regression and
heatmap prediction to tackle the class imbalance encountered by evidential
learning. Moreover, we propose a learning scheme to actively utilize the
predicted heatmap uncertainties to improve the detection performance by
focusing on the most uncertain points. We train our model on the KITTI dataset
and evaluate it on challenging out-of-distribution datasets including BDD100K
and nuImages. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the
precision and minimizes the execution time loss in relation to the base model.

					<dc:title>A Topological Distance between Multi-fields based on Multi-Dimensional

					<dc:description>  The problem of computing topological distance between two scalar fields based
on Reeb graphs or contour trees has been studied and applied successfully to
various problems in topological shape matching, data analysis and
visualization. However, generalizing such results for computing distance
measures between two multi-fields based on their Reeb spaces is still in its
infancy. Towards this, in the current paper we propose a technique to compute
an effective distance measure between two multi-fields by computing a novel
multi-dimensional persistence diagram (MDPD) corresponding to each of the
(quantized) Reeb spaces. First, we construct a multi-dimensional Reeb graph
(MDRG), which is a hierarchical decomposition of the Reeb space into a
collection of Reeb graphs. The MDPD corresponding to each MDRG is then computed
based on the persistence diagrams of the component Reeb graphs of the MDRG. Our
distance measure extends the Wasserstein distance between two persistence
diagrams of Reeb graphs to MDPDs of MDRGs. We prove that the proposed measure
is a pseudo-metric and satisfies a stability property. Preliminary
implementation results of the proposed measure have been reported by computing
the distance matrix from the shape retrieval contest data - SHREC 2010 and
SHREC 2018. Experimental results and evaluation measures show that the proposed
distance measure based on the Reeb spaces has more discriminating power in
clustering the shapes as compared to the similar measures between Reeb graphs.

					<dc:description>  We study the long-term behavior of the bright gamma-ray blazar PKS 0402-362.
We collected approximately 13 years of Fermi-LAT data between Aug 2008 to Jan
2021 and identified three bright $\gamma$-ray activity epochs. The second was
found to be the brightest epoch ever seen in this source. We observed most of
the $\gamma$-ray flare peaks to be asymmetric in profile suggesting a slow
cooling time of particles or the varying Doppler factor as the main cause of
these flares. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is fitted with PL and LP spectral
models, and in both cases, the spectral index is very steep. The $\gamma$-ray
spectrum does not extend beyond 10 GeV energy suggesting the emission is
produced within the BLR. The absence of time lags between optical-IR and
$\gamma$-ray suggest one zone emission model. Using the above information, we
have modeled the broadband SED with a simple one-zone emission model using the
publicly available code `GAMERA'. The particle distribution index is found to
be the same as expected in diffusive shock acceleration suggesting it as the
main mechanism of particle acceleration to very high energy up to 4 - 6 GeV.
Throughout the various flux phases, we noticed that the optical emission is
dominated by the thermal disk, suggesting it to be a good source to examine the
disk-jet coupling. We postulate that the observed broadband flares could be
linked with perturbation produced in the disk, which propagates to the jet and
interacts with the standing shock. However, a more detailed examination is
required.

					<dc:description>  The amplitude and morphology of light curves of solar-like stars change
substantially with increasing rotation rate: brightness variations get
amplified and become more regular, which has so far not been explained. We
develop a modelling approach for calculating brightness variations of stars
with various rotation rates and use it to explain observed trends in stellar
photometric variability. We combine numerical simulations of magnetic Flux
Emergence And Transport (FEAT) with a model for stellar brightness variability
to calculate synthetic light curves of stars as observed by the Kepler
telescope. We compute the distribution of magnetic flux on the stellar surface
for various rotation rates and degrees of active-region nesting (i.e., the
tendency of active regions to emerge in the vicinity of recently emerged ones).
Using the resulting maps of the magnetic flux, we compute the rotational
variability of our simulated stellar light curves as a function of rotation
rate and nesting of magnetic features and compare our calculations to Kepler
observations. We show that both rotation rate and degree of nesting have a
strong impact on the amplitude and morphology of stellar light curves. In order
to explain the variability of the bulk of \K{} targets with known rotation
rates, we need to increase the degree of nesting to values much larger than on
the Sun. The suggested increase of nesting with the rotation rate can provide
clues to the flux emergence process for high levels of stellar activity.

					<dc:description>  The use of ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing is the most common
strategy in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, but at the same time
their collection represents the most time-consuming and expensive part of UAV
campaigns. Recently, deep learning has been rapidly developed in the field of
small object detection. In this letter, to automatically extract coordinates
information of ground control points (GCPs) by detecting GCP-markers in UAV
images, we propose a solution that uses a deep learning-based architecture,
YOLOv5-OBB, combined with a confidence threshold filtering algorithm and an
optimal ranking algorithm. We applied our proposed method to a dataset
collected by DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone and obtained good detection performance
with the mean Average Precision (AP) of 0.832 and the highest AP of 0.982 for
the cross-type GCP-markers. The proposed method can be a promising tool for
future implementation of the end-to-end aerial triangulation process.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel representation of convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) in terms of 2-D dynamical systems. To this end, the usual description of
convolutional layers with convolution kernels, i.e., the impulse responses of
linear filters, is realized in state space as a linear time-invariant 2-D
system. The overall convolutional Neural Network composed of convolutional
layers and nonlinear activation functions is then viewed as a 2-D version of a
Lur'e system, i.e., a linear dynamical system interconnected with static
nonlinear components. One benefit of this 2-D Lur'e system perspective on CNNs
is that we can use robust control theory much more efficiently for Lipschitz
constant estimation than previously possible.

					<dc:description>  Wearable head sensor systems use different kinematic signal processing
approaches which limits field-based inter-study comparisons, especially when
artefacts are present in the signal. The aim of this study is to assess the
frequency content and characteristics of head kinematic signals from head
impact reconstruction laboratory and field-based environments to develop an
artefact attenuation filtering method (artefact attenuation method). Laboratory
impacts (n=72) on a test-dummy headform ranging from 25-150 g were conducted
and 126 elite-level rugby union players were equipped with instrumented
mouthguards (iMG) for up to four matches. Power spectral density (PSD)
characteristics of the laboratory impacts and on-field HAE (n=5694) such as the
95th percentile cumulative sum PSD frequency were utilised to develop the
artefact attenuation method. The artefact attenuation method was compared to
two other common filtering approaches (Fourth order (2x2 pole), zero-lag
Butterworth filter with 200 Hz (-6 dB) cut-off frequency (Butterworth-200Hz)
and CFC180 filter) through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mixed linear effects
models for laboratory and on-field events, respectively. The artefact
attenuation method produced an overall higher SNR than the Butterworth-200Hz
and CFC180 filter and on-field peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak angular
acceleration (PAA) values within the magnitude range tested in the laboratory.
Median PLA and PAA were higher for the CFC180 filter than the Butterworth-200Hz
(p&lt;0.01) and artefact attenuation method (p&lt;0.01), reporting values as high as
294 g and 31.2 krad/s2. The artefact attenuation method can be applied to all
commercially available iMG kinematic signals with adequate sample rates to
enable field-based inter-study comparisons.

					<dc:description>  The synchro-Shockley dislocation, as a zonal dislocation, is the major
carrier of plastic deformation in Laves phases at high temperatures. The motion
of synchro-Shockley dislocations is composed of localized transition events
such as kink-pair nucleation, propagation and short-range atomic shuffling.
These events possess small activation volumes, presumably leading to sensitive
temperature and strain rate dependence on the Peierls stress. However, the
thermally activated nature of synchro-Shockley dislocations is not fully
understood so far. In this study, the transition mechanisms of the
rate-limiting steps of the motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations at different
shear strain levels are studied. The transition processes of dislocation motion
can be divided into shear-sensitive and -insensitive events. The external shear
strain lowers the energy barriers of shear-sensitive events. Thermal assistance
is indispensable in activating shear-insensitive events, implying that the
motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations is prohibited at low temperatures. We
aim to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of motion of zonal
dislocations in complex crystals.

					<dc:description>  The Sun is the main energy source to Earth, and understanding its variability
is of direct relevance to climate studies. Measurements of total solar
irradiance exist since 1978, but this is too short compared to climate-relevant
time scales. Coming from a number of different instruments, these measurements
require a cross-calibration, which is not straightforward, and thus several
composite records have been created. All of them suggest a marginally
decreasing trend since 1996. Most composites also feature a weak decrease over
the entire period of observations, which is also seen in observations of the
solar surface magnetic field and is further supported by Ca II K data. Some
inconsistencies, however, remain and overall the magnitude and even the
presence of the long-term trend remain uncertain. Different models have been
developed, which are used to understand the irradiance variability over the
satellite period and to extend the records of solar irradiance back in time.
Differing in their methodologies, all models require proxies of solar magnetic
activity as input. The most widely used proxies are sunspot records and
cosmogenic isotope data on centennial and millennial time scale, respectively.
None of this, however, offers a sufficiently good, independent description of
the long-term evolution of faculae and network responsible for solar
brightening. This leads to uncertainty in the amplitude of the long-term
changes in solar irradiance. Here we review recent efforts to improve
irradiance reconstructions on time scales longer than the solar cycle and to
reduce the existing uncertainty in the magnitude of the long-term variability.
In particular, we highlight the potential of using 3D magnetohydrodynamical
simulations of the solar atmosphere as input to more physical irradiance models
and of historical full-disc Ca II K observations encrypting direct facular
information back to 1892.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the optimal rate of convergence in the multidimensional normal
approximation of vector-valued Wiener-Ito integrals of which components all
belong to the same fixed Wiener chaos. Combining Malliavin calculus, Stein's
method for normal approximation and method of cumulants, we obtain the optimal
rate of convergence with respect to a suitable smooth distance. As
applications, we derive the optimal rates of convergences for complex
Wiener-Ito integrals, vector-valued Wiener-Ito integrals with kernels of step
functions and vector-valued Toeplitz quadratic functionals.

					<dc:description>  Crop monitoring is crucial for maximizing agricultural productivity and
efficiency. However, monitoring large and complex structures such as sweet
pepper plants presents significant challenges, especially due to frequent
occlusions of the fruits. Traditional next-best view planning can lead to
unstructured and inefficient coverage of the crops. To address this, we propose
a novel view motion planner that builds a graph network of viable view poses
and trajectories between nearby poses, thereby considering robot motion
constraints. The planner searches the graphs for view sequences with the
highest accumulated information gain, allowing for efficient pepper plant
monitoring while minimizing occlusions. The generated view poses aim at both
sufficiently covering already detected and discovering new fruits. The graph
and the corresponding best view pose sequence are computed with a limited
horizon and are adaptively updated in fixed time intervals as the system
gathers new information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through simulated and real-world experiments using a robotic arm equipped with
an RGB-D camera and mounted on a trolley. As the experimental results show, our
planner produces view pose sequences to systematically cover the crops and
leads to increased fruit coverage when given a limited time in comparison to a
state-of-the-art single next-best view planner.

					<dc:description>  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease most
often associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline. With the aging
population, there has been much interest in automated methods for cognitive
impairment detection. One approach that has attracted attention in recent years
is AD detection through spontaneous speech. While the results are promising, it
is not certain whether the learned speech features can be generalized across
languages. To fill this gap, the ADReSS-M challenge was organized. This paper
presents our submission to this ICASSP-2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenge
(SPGC). The model was trained on 228 English samples of a picture description
task and was transferred to Greek using only 8 samples. We obtained an accuracy
of 82.6% for AD detection, a root-mean-square error of 4.345 for cognitive
score prediction, and ranked 2nd place in the competition out of 24
competitors.

					<dc:description>  Image retrieval has garnered growing interest in recent times. The current
approaches are either supervised or self-supervised. These methods do not
exploit the benefits of hybrid learning using both supervision and
self-supervision. We present a novel Master Assistant Buddy Network (MABNet)
for image retrieval which incorporates both learning mechanisms. MABNet
consists of master and assistant blocks, both learning independently through
supervision and collectively via self-supervision. The master guides the
assistant by providing its knowledge base as a reference for self-supervision
and the assistant reports its knowledge back to the master by weight transfer.
We perform extensive experiments on public datasets with and without
post-processing.

					<dc:title>Improved bounds for the numerical radius via polar decomposition of

					<dc:subject>47A12, 47A30, 15A60</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Using the polar decomposition of a bounded linear operator $A$ defined on a
complex Hilbert space, we obtain several numerical radius inequalities of the
operator $A$, which generalize and improve the earlier related ones. Among
other bounds, we show that if $w(A)$ is the numerical radius of $A$, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
  w(A) &amp;\leq&amp; \frac12 \|A\|^{1/2} \left\| |A|^{t} + |A^*|^{1-t} \right \|,
\end{eqnarray*}
  for all $t\in [0,1].$ Also, we obtain some upper bounds for the numerical
radius involving the spectral radius and the Aluthge transform of operators. It
is shown that
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  w(A) &amp;\leq&amp; \|A\|^{1/2} \left( \frac12 \left \| \frac{ |A|+|A^*|}2 \right\|
+\frac12 \left\| \widetilde{A}\right \| \right)^{1/2}, \end{eqnarray*} where
$\widetilde{A}= |A|^{1/2}U|A|^{1/2} $ is the Aluthge transform of $A$ and
$A=U|A|$ is the polar decomposition of $A$. Other related results are also
provided.

					<dc:description>  Deep learning models are challenged by the distribution shift between the
training data and test data. Recently, the large models pre-trained on diverse
data demonstrate unprecedented robustness to various distribution shifts.
However, fine-tuning on these models can lead to a trade-off between
in-distribution (ID) performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness.
Existing methods for tackling this trade-off do not explicitly address the OOD
robustness problem. In this paper, based on causal analysis on the
aforementioned problems, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, which use
masked images as counterfactual samples that help improving the robustness of
the fine-tuning model. Specifically, we mask either the semantics-related or
semantics-unrelated patches of the images based on class activation map to
break the spurious correlation, and refill the masked patches with patches from
other images. The resulting counterfactual samples are used in feature-based
distillation with the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments verify that
regularizing the fine-tuning with the proposed masked images can achieve a
better trade-off between ID and OOD, surpassing previous methods on the OOD
performance. Our code will be publicly available.

					<dc:description>  Most tasks in NLP require labeled data. Data labeling is often done on
crowdsourcing platforms due to scalability reasons. However, publishing data on
public platforms can only be done if no privacy-relevant information is
included. Textual data often contains sensitive information like person names
or locations. In this work, we investigate how removing personally identifiable
information (PII) as well as applying differential privacy (DP) rewriting can
enable text with privacy-relevant information to be used for crowdsourcing. We
find that DP-rewriting before crowdsourcing can preserve privacy while still
leading to good label quality for certain tasks and data. PII-removal led to
good label quality in all examined tasks, however, there are no privacy
guarantees given.

					<dc:description>  Compared with random sampling, low-discrepancy sampling is more effective in
covering the search space. However, the existing research cannot definitely
state whether the impact of a low-discrepancy sample on particle swarm
optimization (PSO) is positive or negative. Using Niderreiter's theorem, this
study completes an error analysis of PSO, which reveals that the error bound of
PSO at each iteration depends on the dispersion of the sample set in an
expanded dimensional space. Based on this error analysis, an acceleration
technique for PSO-type algorithms is proposed with low-discrepancy sampling in
the expanded dimensional space. The acceleration technique can generate a
low-discrepancy sample set with a smaller dispersion, compared with a random
sampling, in the expanded dimensional space; it also reduces the error at each
iteration, and hence improves the convergence speed. The acceleration technique
is combined with the standard PSO and the comprehensive learning particle swarm
optimization, and the performance of the improved algorithm is compared with
the original algorithm. The experimental results show that the two improved
algorithms have significantly faster convergence speed under the same accuracy
requirement.

					<dc:description>  With the recent advances in autonomous driving and the decreasing cost of
LiDARs, the use of multi-modal sensor systems is on the rise. However, in order
to make use of the information provided by a variety of complimentary sensors,
it is necessary to accurately calibrate them. We take advantage of recent
advances in computer graphics and implicit volumetric scene representation to
tackle the problem of multi-sensor spatial and temporal calibration. Thanks to
a new formulation of the implicit model optimization, we are able to jointly
optimize calibration parameters along with scene representation based on
radiometric and geometric measurements. Our method enables accurate and robust
calibration from data captured in uncontrolled and unstructured urban
environments, making our solution more scalable than existing calibration
solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method in urban
scenes typically encountered in autonomous driving scenarios.

					<dc:description>  We show that a two-dimensional system of active particles that interact
hydrodynamically such as microswimmers can be expressed using a unifying
Hamiltonian formalism. We simulate a random arrangement of co-oriented
microswimmers and find they evolve into sharp lines at a particular tilt. We
call these states &quot;escalators&quot; as particles circulate along these canted
conveyor belts. We argue that the conservation of the Hamiltonian and its
symmetry germinate the self-assembly of the observed steady-state arrangements.
The Hamiltonian is scale-invariant and depends strictly on the angles between
the particles and their swimming orientation, thereby restricting their
available phase-space. Stability analysis confirms that alignment at either a
low or a high angle is unstable, and the ensemble of swimmers breaks into
escalators.

					<dc:description>  Galaxy spins are believed to retain initially acquired tendency of being
aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the linear tidal field, which
disseminates a prospect of using them as a probe of the early universe physics.
This roseate prospect, however, is contingent upon the key assumption that the
observable stellar spins of the present galaxies measured at inner radii have
the same alignment tendency toward the initial tidal field as their dark matter
counterparts measured at virial limits. We test this assumption directly
against a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation to find that the present
galaxy stellar spins have strong but {\it reoriented} memory for the early
universe. An analytic single-parameter formula for this reorientation is
derived and found to be in good accord with the numerical results.

					<dc:description>  Energy redistribution after a chemical reaction is one of the few mechanisms
to explain the diffusion and desorption of molecules which require more energy
than the thermal energy available in quiescent molecular clouds (10 K). This
energy distribution can be important in phosphorous hydrides, elusive yet
fundamental molecules for interstellar prebiotic chemistry. We studied the
reaction dynamics of the \ce{P + H -&gt; PH} reaction on amorphous solid water, a
reaction of astrophysical interest, using \emph{ab-initio} molecular dynamics
with atomic forces evaluated by a neural network interatomic potential. We
found that the exact nature of the initial phosphorous binding sites is less
relevant for the energy dissipation process because the nascent PH molecule
rapidly migrates to sites with higher binding energy after the reaction.
Non-thermal diffusion and desorption-after-reaction were observed and occurred
early in the dynamics, essentially decoupled from the dissipation of the
chemical reaction energy. From an extensive sampling of reactions on sites, we
constrained the average dissipated reaction energy within the simulation time
(50 ps) to be between 50 and 70 %. Most importantly, the fraction of
translational energy acquired by the formed molecule was found to be mostly
between 1 and 5 %. Including these values, specifically for the test cases of
2% and 5% of translational energy conversion, in astrochemical models, reveals
very low gas-phase abundances of PH$_{x}$ molecules and reflects that
considering binding energy distributions is paramount for correctly merging
microscopic and macroscopic modelling of non-thermal surface astrochemical
processes. Finally, we found that PD molecules dissipate more of the reaction
energy. This effect can be relevant for the deuterium fractionation and
preferential distillation of molecules in the interstellar medium.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we carry out the numerical analysis of a nonsmooth quasilinear
elliptic optimal control problem, where the coefficient in the divergence term
of the corresponding state equation is not differentiable with respect to the
state variable. Despite the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity in
the quasilinear elliptic equation, the corresponding control-to-state operator
is of class $C^1$ but not of class $C^2$. Analogously, the discrete
control-to-state operators associated with the approximated control problems
are proven to be of class $C^1$ only. By using an explicit second-order
sufficient optimality condition, we prove a priori error estimates for a
variational approximation, a piecewise constant approximation, and a continuous
piecewise linear approximation of the continuous optimal control problem. The
numerical tests confirm these error estimates.

					<dc:description>  The instanton size $\rho$ and inter-instanton distance $R$ are the main
parameters of Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum. Various estimates
show that $\rho\approx1/3$ fm and $R\approx1$ fm, and the corresponding packing
parameter $\kappa=\rho^{4}/R^{4}\approx0.01$. The strength of the light
quark-instanton interaction is sizable and close to that of the gluon-instanton
one since the dynamical light quark mass $M_{q}$ and dynamical gluon mass
$M_{g}$ are given by $M_{q}\approx M_{g}\approx 360$
MeV$\sim\kappa^{1/2}\rho^{-1}$. On the other hand, the strength of the heavy
quark-instanton interaction is weak - the direct instanton contribution to the
heavy quark mass $\Delta M_{Q}^{{\rm dir}}\approx70$ MeV$\sim\kappa\rho^{-1}.$
The instantons are responsible for mutual interactions among colored particles
which are crossing the field of the same instanton, like t'Hooft-like
interactions of $N_{f}$ light quarks ($N_{f}$ is the light quark flavors
number). The light quark propagators in the instanton field have zero modes,
which give dominant contributions. Within ILM we are able to derive the light
quarks determinants and the light quarks partition function. These tools
perfectly describe the light quark physics and its most important and basic
phenomena - the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry (SBChS) in details.
These one allows us to find the properties of light and heavy quarks
interactions and get SBChS traces in light-heavy and heavy-heavy quarks
systems. So, we need to find heavy $Q\bar{Q}$ quarkonia spectra and their wave
functions. Here we have interplay of two scales: short
($\sim(M_{Q}v)^{-1}\leq0.15$ fm) perturbative QCD and large
($\sim(M_{Q}v^{2})^{-1}\sim0.5$ fm) nonperturbative QCD scales, where $v$ is
the velocity in $Q\bar{Q}$. We calculate the heavy quarks correlators with
perturbative corrections within ILM.

					<dc:description>  Thermoelectric (TE) materials seamlessly convert thermal into electrical
energy and vice versa, making them promising for applications such as power
generation or cooling. Although historically the TE effect was first discovered
in metals, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on doped semiconductors
with large figure of merit, $zT$, that determines the conversion efficiency of
TE devices. While metallic alloys have superior functional properties, such as
high ductility and mechanical strength, they have mostly been discarded from
investigation in the past due to their small Seebeck effect. Here, we realize
unprecedented TE performance in metals by tuning the energy-dependent
electronic scattering. Based on our theoretical predictions, we identify binary
NiAu alloys as promising candidate materials and experimentally discover
colossal power factors up to 34 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ (on average 30
mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ from 300 to 1100 K), which is more than twice larger than in
any known bulk material above room temperature. This system reaches a $zT$ up
to 0.5, setting a new world record value for metals. NiAu alloys are not only
orders of magnitude more conductive than heavily doped semiconductors, but also
have large Seebeck coefficients originating from an inherently different
physical mechanism: within the Au s band conduction electrons are highly mobile
while holes are scattered into more localized Ni d states, yielding a strongly
energy-dependent carrier mobility. Our work challenges the common belief that
good metals are bad thermoelectrics and presents an auspicious paradigm for
achieving high TE performance in metallic alloys through engineering
electron-hole selective s-d scattering.

					<dc:description>  Recent experiments in cell biology have probed the impact of
artificially-induced intracellular flows in the spatiotemporal organisation of
cells and organisms. In these experiments, mild dynamical heating via focused
infrared light from a laser leads to long-range, thermoviscous flows of the
cytoplasm inside a cell, a method popularised in cell biology as FLUCS
(focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming). Here, we present a fully
analytical, theoretical model describing the fluid flow and transport of
tracers induced by the laser at all length scales in two-dimensional
confinement. The focused light causes a small, local temperature change, which
in turn results in a small change in the density and viscosity of the fluid
locally. We analytically solve for the instantaneous flow field due to the
translation of a heat spot of arbitrary time-dependent amplitude along a scan
path. We show that the leading-order instantaneous flow results purely from
thermal expansion. It is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature
perturbation, with far-field behaviour typically dominated by a source or sink
flow and proportional to the rate of change of the heat-spot amplitude. In
contrast, and in agreement with experimental measurements, the net displacement
of a tracer due to a full scan of the heat spot is quadratic in the heat-spot
amplitude, as it results from the interplay of thermal expansion and thermal
viscosity changes. The corresponding average velocity of tracers over a scan is
a hydrodynamic source dipole in the far field, with direction dependent on the
relative importance of thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes. Our
quantitative findings show excellent agreement with recent experimental results
and will enable the design of new controlled experiments to establish the
physiological role of physical transport processes inside cells.

					<dc:description>  Film flow through networks of corners and capillary bridges can establish
connections between seemingly isolated clusters during drainage in porous
media. Coupled with drainage through the bulk of pores and throats, the flow
through these networks constitutes a secondary drainage mechanism that can
significantly affect fluid configurations and residual saturations. In order to
investigate the prevalence of this drainage mechanism, we propose a
quasi-static pore-network model based on modifying the
trapped-cluster-identification algorithm in an invasion-percolation model. With
the modification, wetting-phase connectivity could be provided by direct
successions of pores and throats, represented by sites and bonds, as well as by
chains of interconnected capillary bridges. The advancement of the fluid
interface in the porous matrix was determined by the bonds' invasion
thresholds, calculated based on local capillary pressure values that could be
perturbed to accommodate gravitational effects. With the proposed model,
experimentally verified phenomena related to slow drainage in granular porous
media were reproduced, showing good qualitative agreement.

=&lt; x =&lt; 1.0) compounds were investigated employing x-ray powder diffraction and
magnetometry. The crystal structure evolves from orthorhombic Pnma to
rhombohedral R-3c and then to hexagonal P63/mmc space group as the Ba
concentration increases. The magnetization as a function of temperature
measurements revealed a ferromagnetic-like behavior for all samples, but
antiferromagnetic interactions seem to also be present throughout the whole
series. The competition between magnetic phases leads to the phenomenon of
spontaneous exchange bias effect, observed in the zero field cooled
magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field curves. The evolution of
this effect along the series is discussed in terms of changes in the crystal
structure.

					<dc:description>  Observational studies of GHz peaked spectrum (GPS) sources contribute to the
understanding of the radiative properties and interstellar environment of host
galaxies. We present the results from the multi-frequency high-resolution VLBI
observations of a sample of nine GPS sources at 8, 15, and 43 GHz. All sources
show a core-jet structure. Four sources show relativistic jets with Doppler
boosting factors ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 and a jet viewing angle between
10{\deg} and 30{\deg}. The core brightness temperatures of the other five
sources are below the equipartition brightness temperature limit with their jet
viewing angles in the range of 13.6{\deg} degrees to 71.9{\deg}, which are
systematically larger than those of relativistic jets in this sample. The
sources show diverse variability properties, with variability levels ranging
from 0.11 to 0.56. The measured turnover frequency in the radio spectrum ranges
from 6.2 and 31.8 GHz. We estimate the equipartition magnetic field strength to
be between 9 and 48 mG. These results strongly support the notion that these
GPS sources are young radio sources in the very early stage of their evolution.

					<dc:description>  Majorana fermions as emergent excitations of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid
ground state constitute a promising concept in fault tolerant quantum
computation. Experimentally, the recently reported topological half-quantized
thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ seems to confirm
the Majorana nature of the material's magnetic excitations. It has been argued,
however, that the thermal Hall signal in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rather stems from
phonons or topological magnons than from Majorana fermions. Here we investigate
the thermal Hall effect of the closely related Kitaev quantum material
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, and we show that the thermal Hall signal emerges from at
least two components, phonons and magnetic excitations. This dichotomy results
from our discovery that the transversal heat conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ carries
clear signatures of the phononic $\kappa_{xx}$, but changes sign upon entering
the low-temperature, magnetically ordered phase. We systematically resolve the
two components by considering the detailed temperature and field dependence of
both $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$. Our results demonstrate that uncovering a
genuinely quantized magnetic thermal Hall effect in a Kitaev topological
quantum spin liquid requires to disentangle phonon vs. magnetic contributions
where the latter include potentially fractionalized excitations such as the
expected Majorana fermions.

					<dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven itself as a powerful
instrument for solving complex problems and even surpassed human performance in
several challenging applications. This signifies that RL algorithms can be used
in the autonomous air combat problem, which has been studied for many years.
The complexity of air combat arises from aggressive close-range maneuvers and
agile enemy behaviors. In addition to these complexities, there may be
uncertainties in real-life scenarios due to sensor errors, which prevent
estimation of the actual position of the enemy. In this case, autonomous
aircraft should be successful even in the noisy environments. In this study, we
developed an air combat simulation, which provides noisy observations to the
agents, therefore, make the air combat problem even more challenging. Thus, we
present a state stacking method for noisy RL environments as a noise reduction
technique. In our extensive set of experiments, the proposed method
significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the winning
ratio, where the performance improvement is even more pronounced in the high
noise levels. In addition, we incorporate a self-play scheme to our training
process by periodically updating the enemy with a frozen copy of the training
agent. By this way, the training agent performs air combat simulations to an
enemy with smarter strategies, which improves the performance and robustness of
the agents. In our simulations, we demonstrate that the self-play scheme
provides important performance gains compared to the classical RL training.

					<dc:description>  This paper complements a previous study of the isotropic and nematic phases
of the Gay-Berne liquid-crystal model [Mehri et al., Phys. Rev. E 105, 064703
(2022)] with a study of its smectic B phase found at high density and low
temperatures. We find also in this phase strong correlations between the virial
and potential-energy thermal fluctuations, reflecting hidden scale invariance
which implies the existence of isomorphs. The predicted approximate isomorph
invariance of the physics is confirmed by simulations of the standard and
orientational radial distribution functions, the mean-square displacement as a
function of time, as well as the force, torque, velocity, angular velocity, and
orientational time-autocorrelation functions. The regions of the Gay-Berne
model that are relevant for liquid-crystal experiments can thus fully be
simplified via the isomorph theory.

					<dc:description>  The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things and the emergence of edge
computing-based applications has led to a new wave of cyber-attacks, with
intensity and complexity that has never been seen before. Historically most
research has focused on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), however due to the
volume and speed of this new generation of cyber-attacks it is no longer
sufficient to solely detect attacks and leave the response to security
analysts. Consequently, research into Intrusion Response Systems (IRS) is
accelerating rapidly. As such, new intrusion response approaches, methods and
systems have been investigated, prototyped, and deployed. This paper is
intended to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art of IRSs.
Specifically, a taxonomy to characterize the lifecycle of IRSs ranging from
response selection to response deployment and response implementation is
presented. A 10-phase structure to organize the core technical constituents of
IRSs is also presented. Following this, an extensive review and analysis of the
literature on IRSs published during the past decade is provided, and further
classifies them into corresponding phases based on the proposed taxonomy and
phase structure. This study provides a new way of classifying IRS research,
thus offering in-depth insights into the latest discoveries and findings. In
addition, through critical analysis and comparison, expert views, guidance and
best practices on intrusion response approaches, system development and
standardization are presented, upon which future research challenges and
directions are postulated.

					<dc:description>  We have studied the impact of the non-extensivity on the transport
coefficients related to charge and heat in thermal QCD. For this purpose, the
electrical ($\sigma_{\rm el}$), Hall ($\sigma_{\rm H}$), thermal ($\kappa$) and
Hall-type thermal ($\kappa_{\rm H}$) conductivities are determined using the
kinetic theory approach in association with the non-extensive Tsallis
statistical mechanism. The effect of non-extensivity is encoded in the
non-extensive Tsallis distribution function, where the deviation of the
parameter $q$ from 1 signifies the degree of non-extensivity in the concerned
system. The thermal and electrical conductivities are found to increase with
the introduction of non-extensivity, which means that the deviation of the
medium from thermal equilibrium enhances both charge and heat transports. With
the magnetic field, the deviations of $\sigma_{\rm el}$, $\sigma_{\rm H}$,
$\kappa$ and $\kappa_{\rm H}$ from their respective equilibrated values
increase, whereas these deviations decrease with the chemical potential. We
have also studied how the extent of the non-extensivity modulates the longevity
of magnetic field and observed that the time of existence of a stable magnetic
field increases as $q$ rises above unity. Thus, as compared to a thermally
equilibrated medium, the lifetime of the magnetic field is longer in a medium
which is about to reach equilibrium. Present work is further extended to the
study of some observables associated with the aforesaid transport phenomena,
such as the Knudsen number and the elliptic flow within the non-extensive
Tsallis framework.

					<dc:description>  Intermediate stages between pores and sunspots are a rare phenomenon and can
manifest with the formation of transient photospheric penumbral-like filaments.
Although the magnetic field changes rapidly during the evolution of such
filaments, they have not been shown to be connected to magnetic reconnection
events yet. We analyzed observations of a pore in NOAA AR 12739 from the
Swedish Solar Telescope including spectropolarimetric data of the Fe I 6173
{\AA} and the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line and spectroscopic data of the Ca II K 3934
{\AA} line. The VFISV Milne-Eddington inversion code and the multi-line Non-LTE
inversion code STiC were utilized to obtain atmospheric parameters in the
photosphere and the chromosphere. Multiple filamentary structures of inclined
magnetic fields are found in photospheric inclination maps at the boundary of
the pore, although the pore never developed a penumbra. One of the filaments
shows a clear counterpart in continuum intensity maps in addition to
photospheric blueshifts. During its decay, a brightening in the blue wing of
the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line is observed. The Ca II K 3934 {\AA} and the Ca II
8542 {\AA} lines show complex spectral profiles in this region. Depth-dependent
STiC inversion results using data from all available lines yield a temperature
increase (roughly 1000 Kelvin) and bidirectional flows (magnitudes up to 8
km/s) at log tau=-3.5. The temporal and spatial correlation of the decaying
filament (observed in the photosphere) to the temperature increase and the
bidirectional flows in the high photosphere/low chromosphere suggests that they
are connected. We propose scenarios in which magnetic reconnection happens at
the edge of a rising magnetic flux tube in the photosphere. This leads to both
the decay of the filament in the photosphere and the observed temperature
increase and the bidirectional flows in the high photosphere/low chromosphere.

					<dc:description>  This paper introduces the Neural Network for Nonlinear Hawkes processes
(NNNH), a non-parametric method based on neural networks to fit nonlinear
Hawkes processes. Our method is suitable for analyzing large datasets in which
events exhibit both mutually-exciting and inhibitive patterns. The NNNH
approach models the individual kernels and the base intensity of the nonlinear
Hawkes process using feed forward neural networks and jointly calibrates the
parameters of the networks by maximizing the log-likelihood function. We
utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent to search for the optimal parameters and
propose an unbiased estimator for the gradient, as well as an efficient
computation method. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of our method
through numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world data, and
compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of the NNNH method in accurately capturing the complexities of
nonlinear Hawkes processes.

					<dc:description>  Redistribution mechanism design aims to redistribute the revenue collected by
a truthful auction back to its participants without affecting the truthfulness.
We study redistribution mechanisms for diffusion auctions, which is a new trend
in mechanism design [19]. The key property of a diffusion auction is that the
existing participants are incentivized to invite new participants to join the
auctions. Hence, when we design redistributions, we also need to maintain this
incentive. Existing redistribution mechanisms in the traditional setting are
targeted at modifying the payment design of a truthful mechanism, such as the
Vickrey auction. In this paper, we do not focus on one specific mechanism.
Instead, we propose a general framework to redistribute the revenue back for
all truthful diffusion auctions for selling a single item. The framework treats
the original truthful diffusion auction as a black box, and it does not affect
its truthfulness. The framework can also distribute back almost all the
revenue.

					<dc:description>  Achieving large-scale growth of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials
with high Curie temperature (TC) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is
highly desirable for the development of ultra-compact magnetic sensors and
magnetic memories. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) Cr2Te3 appears as a
promising candidate. Bulk Cr2Te3 exhibits strong PMA and a TC of 180 K.
Moreover, both PMA and TC might be adjusted in ultrathin films by engineering
composition, strain, or applying an electric field. In this work, we
demonstrate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of vdW heterostructures of
five-monolayer quasi-freestanding Cr2Te3 on three classes of 2D materials:
graphene (semimetal), WSe2 (semiconductor) and Bi2Te3 (topological insulator).
By combining structural and chemical analysis down to the atomic level with ab
initio calculations, we confirm the single crystalline character of Cr2Te3
films on the 2D materials with sharp vdW interfaces. They all exhibit PMA and
TC close to the bulk Cr2Te3 value of 180 K. Ab initio calculations confirm this
PMA and show how its strength depends on strain. Finally, Hall measurements
reveal a strong anomalous Hall effect, which changes sign at a given
temperature. We theoretically explain this effect by a sign change of the Berry
phase close to the Fermi level. This transition temperature depends on the 2D
material in proximity, notably as a consequence of charge transfer. MBE-grown
Cr2Te3/2D material bilayers constitute model systems for the further
development of spintronic devices combining PMA, large spin-orbit coupling and
sharp vdW interface.

					<dc:description>  Designing auctions to incentivize buyers to invite new buyers via their
social connections is a new trend in mechanism design. The challenge is that
buyers are competitors and we need to design proper incentives for them to
invite each other. For selling a single item, many interesting mechanisms have
been proposed. However, all the mechanisms require the seller or a third party
to be trustworthy to execute the mechanisms. In addition, the owner of the
mechanism will know all the connections of the network after the execution,
which poses a potential privacy issue. Hence, distributed mechanisms to avoid
the privacy issue are more appealing in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first distributed mechanism in social networks without revealing
buyers' private connections to anyone, and it achieves complete
decentralization that does not rely on any trustworthy third party. Moreover,
the centralized reduction of our mechanism also offers a novel way to compute
players' contributions compared to the existing solutions.

					<dc:description>  Complex or hostile environments can sometimes inhibit the movement
capabilities of diffusive particles or active swimmers, who may thus become
stuck in fixed positions. Here we analyze the dynamics of active particles in
the presence of trapping regions, where irreversible particle immobilization
occurs at a fixed rate. By solving the kinetic equations for run-and-tumble
motion in one space dimension, we give expressions for probability distribution
functions, focusing on stationary distributions of blocked particles, and mean
trapping times in terms of physical and geometrical parameters. Different
extensions of the trapping region are considered, from infinite to cases of
semi-infinite and finite intervals. The mean trapping time turns out to be
simply the inverse of the trapping rate for infinitely extended trapping zones,
while it has a nontrivial form in the semi-infinite case and is undefined for
finite domains, due to the appearance of long tails in the trapping time
distribution. We also discuss various interesting limits, describing diffusive
motion and first-passage processes in finite domains with absorbing boundaries.

					<dc:description>  The IFRS 9 accounting standard requires the prediction of credit
deterioration in financial instruments, i.e., significant increases in credit
risk (SICR). However, the definition of such a SICR-event is inherently
ambiguous, given its reliance on comparing two subsequent estimates of default
risk against some arbitrary threshold. We examine the shortcomings of this
approach and propose an alternative framework for generating SICR-definitions,
based on three parameters: delinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period.
Having varied these parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit
logistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage data;
itself containing various macroeconomic and obligor-specific input variables.
This new SICR-modelling approach is demonstrated by analysing the resulting
portfolio-level SICR-rates (of each SICR-definition) on their stability over
time and their responsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we
compare both the accuracy and flexibility of the SICR-predictions across all
SICR-definitions, and discover several interesting trends during this process.
These trends form a rudimentary expert system for selecting the three
parameters optimally, as demonstrated in our recommendations for defining
SICR-events. In summary, our work can guide the formulation, testing, and
modelling of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting the timeous recognition of
credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.

					<dc:description>  The competition between non-commuting projective measurements in discrete
quantum circuits can give rise to entanglement transitions. It separates a
regime where initially stored quantum information survives the time evolution
from a regime where the measurements destroy the quantum information. Here we
study one such system - the projective transverse field Ising model - with
focus on its capabilities as a quantum error correction code. The idea is to
interpret one type of measurements as errors and the other type as syndrome
measurements. We demonstrate that there is a finite threshold below which
quantum information encoded in an initially entangled state can be retrieved
reliably. In particular, we implement the maximum likelihood decoder to
demonstrate that the error correction threshold is distinct from the
entanglement transition. This implies that there is a finite regime where
quantum information is protected by the projective dynamics, but cannot be
retrieved by using syndrome measurements.

					<dc:description>  We consider a cost sharing problem on a weighted undirected graph, where all
the nodes want to connect to a special node called source, and they need to
share the total cost (weights) of the used edges. Each node except for the
source has a private valuation of the connection, and it may block others'
connections by strategically cutting its adjacent edges to reduce its cost
share, which may increase the total cost. We aim to design mechanisms to
prevent the nodes from misreporting their valuations and cutting their adjacent
edges. We first show that it is impossible for such a mechanism to further
satisfy budget balance (cover the total cost) and efficiency (maximize social
welfare). Then, we design two feasible cost sharing mechanisms that incentivize
each node to offer all its adjacent edges and truthfully report its valuation,
and also satisfy either budget balance or efficiency.

					<dc:description>  In the classic regression problem, the value of a real-valued random variable
$Y$ is to be predicted based on the observation of a random vector $X$, taking
its values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\geq 1$ say. The statistical learning
problem consists in building a predictive function $\hat{f}:\mathbb{R}^d\to
\mathbb{R}$ based on independent copies of the pair $(X,Y)$ so that $Y$ is
approximated by $\hat{f}(X)$ with minimum error in the mean-squared sense.
Motivated by various applications, ranging from environmental sciences to
finance or insurance, special attention is paid here to the case of extreme
(i.e. very large) observations $X$. Because of their rarity, they contribute in
a negligible manner to the (empirical) error and the predictive performance of
empirical quadratic risk minimizers can be consequently very poor in extreme
regions. In this paper, we develop a general framework for regression in the
extremes. It is assumed that $X$'s conditional distribution given $Y$ belongs
to a non parametric class of heavy-tailed probability distributions. It is then
shown that an asymptotic notion of risk can be tailored to summarize
appropriately predictive performance in extreme regions of the input space. It
is also proved that minimization of an empirical and non asymptotic version of
this 'extreme risk', based on a fraction of the largest observations solely,
yields regression functions with good generalization capacity. In addition,
numerical results providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the
approach proposed are displayed.

					<dc:description>  We propose and analyze unfitted finite element approximations for the
two-phase incompressible Navier--Stokes flow in an axisymmetric setting. The
discretized schemes are based on an Eulerian weak formulation for the
Navier--Stokes equation in the 2d-meridian halfplane, together with a
parametric formulation for the generating curve of the evolving interface. We
use the lowest order Taylor--Hood and piecewise linear elements for
discretizing the Navier--Stokes formulation in the bulk and the moving
interface, respectively. We discuss a variety of schemes, amongst which is a
linear scheme that enjoys an equidistribution property on the discrete
interface and good volume conservation. An alternative scheme can be shown to
be unconditionally stable and to conserve the volume of the two phases exactly.
Numerical results are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the
introduced methods for simulating both rising bubble and oscillating droplet
experiments.

					<dc:description>  An edit distance is a metric between words that quantifies how two words
differ by counting the number of edit operations needed to transform one word
into the other one. A word f is said isometric with respect to an edit distance
if, for any pair of f-free words u and v, there exists a transformation of
minimal length from u to v via the related edit operations such that all the
intermediate words are also f-free. The adjective 'isometric' comes from the
fact that, if the Hamming distance is considered (i.e., only mismatches), then
isometric words are connected with definitions of isometric subgraphs of
hypercubes. We consider the case of edit distance with swap and mismatch. We
compare it with the case of mismatch only and prove some properties of
isometric words that are related to particular features of their overlaps.

interface of a metal and a dielectric material was investigated for a
dielectric material with strongly temperature-dependent constitutive
properties. The metal was silver and the dielectric material was vanadium
multioxide impregnated with a combination of active dyes. Depending upon the
volume fraction of vanadium multioxide, either attenuation or amplification of
the SPP waves may be achieved; the degree of attenuation or amplification is
strongly dependent on both the temperature and whether the temperature is
increasing or decreasing. At intermediate volume fractions of vanadium
multioxide, for a fixed temperature, a SPP wave may experience attenuation if
the temperature is increasing but experience amplification if the temperature
is decreasing.

We analyze this problem through scaling theory and simulations, and uncover a
regime where filaments ends find each other through bending fluctuations
without the need for the whole filament to diffuse. This results in a very
substantial speed-up of assembly in physiological regimes, and could help
understand the dynamics of actin and intermediate filaments in biological
processes such as wound healing and cell division.

					<dc:description>  The localization of bifurcations in large parametric systems is still a
challenge where the combination of rigorous criteria and informal intuition is
often needed. With this motivation, we address symbolically the Jacobian matrix
of reaction networks with general kinetics. More specifically, we consider any
nonzero partial derivative of a reaction rate as a free positive symbol. The
main tool are the Child-Selections: injective maps that associate species $m$
to reactions $j$ where $m$ participates as reactant. Firstly, we employ a
Cauchy-Binet analysis and we structurally express any coefficient of the
characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian in terms of Child-Selections. In
particular, we fully characterize sign-changes of any of the coefficients.
Secondly, we prove that the (in)stability of the Jacobian is inherited from the
(in)stability of simpler submatrices identified by the Child-Selections.
Thirdly, we provide sufficient conditions for purely imaginary eigenvalues of
the Jacobian, hinting at Hopf bifurcation and oscillatory behavior. All
conditions are in terms of signs of integer stoichiometric submatrices
identified by the Child-Selections. Finally, we focus on systems endowed with
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and we show that any symbolic realization of the
Jacobian matrix can be achieved at a fixed equilibrium by a proper choice of
the kinetic constants.

					<dc:description>  The development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) facilitates the
enhancement of traffic efficiency in complicated scenarios. In unsignalized
roundabout scenarios, difficulties remain unsolved in developing an effective
and efficient coordination strategy for CAVs. In this paper, we formulate the
cooperative autonomous driving problem of CAVs in the roundabout scenario as a
constrained optimal control problem, and propose a computationally-efficient
parallel optimization framework to generate strategies for CAVs such that the
travel efficiency is improved with hard safety guarantees. All constraints
involved in the roundabout scenario are addressed appropriately with convex
approximation, such that the convexity property of the reformulated
optimization problem is exhibited. Then, a parallel optimization algorithm is
presented to solve the reformulated optimization problem, where an embodied
iterative nearest neighbor search strategy to determine the optimal passing
sequence in the roundabout scenario. It is noteworthy that the travel
efficiency in the roundabout scenario is enhanced and the computation burden is
considerably alleviated with the innovation development. We also examine the
proposed method in CARLA simulator and perform thorough comparisons with a
rule-based baseline and the commonly used IPOPT optimization solver to
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

					<dc:title>On Kenn's Rule of Combination Applied to Breast Cancer Precision Therapy</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This short technical note points out an erroneous claim about a new rule of
combination of basic belief assignments presented recently by Kenn et al. in
2023, referred as Kenn's rule of combination (or just as KRC for short). We
prove thanks a very simple counter-example that Kenn's rule is not associative.
Consequently, the results of the method proposed by Kenn et al. highly depends
on the ad-hoc sequential order chosen for the fusion process as proposed by the
authors. This serious problem casts in doubt the interest of this method and
its real ability to provide trustful results and to make good decisions to help
for precise breast cancer therapy.

					<dc:description>  This paper considers a multiple environments linear regression model in which
data from multiple experimental settings are collected. The joint distribution
of the response variable and covariate may vary across different environments,
yet the conditional expectation of $y$ given the unknown set of important
variables are invariant across environments. Such a statistical model is
related to the problem of endogeneity, causal inference, and transfer learning.
The motivation behind it is illustrated by how the goals of prediction and
attribution are inherent in estimating the true parameter and the important
variable set. We construct a novel {\it environment invariant linear least
squares (EILLS)} objective function, a multiple-environment version of linear
least squares that leverages the above conditional expectation invariance
structure and heterogeneity among different environments to determine the true
parameter. Our proposed method is applicable without any additional structural
knowledge and can identify the true parameter under a near-minimal
identification condition. We establish non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ error bounds on
the estimation error for the EILLS estimator in the presence of spurious
variables. Moreover, we further show that the EILLS estimator is able to
eliminate all endogenous variables and the $\ell_0$ penalized EILLS estimator
can achieve variable selection consistency in high-dimensional regimes. These
non-asymptotic results demonstrate the sample efficiency of the EILLS estimator
and its capability to circumvent the curse of endogeneity in an algorithmic
manner without any prior structural knowledge.

					<dc:description>  In conjunction with huge recent progress in camera and computer vision
technology, camera-based sensors have increasingly shown considerable promise
in relation to tactile sensing. In comparison to competing technologies (be
they resistive, capacitive or magnetic based), they offer
super-high-resolution, while suffering from fewer wiring problems. The human
tactile system is composed of various types of mechanoreceptors, each able to
perceive and process distinct information such as force, pressure, texture,
etc. Camera-based tactile sensors such as GelSight mainly focus on
high-resolution geometric sensing on a flat surface, and their force
measurement capabilities are limited by the hysteresis and non-linearity of the
silicone material. In this paper, we present a miniaturised dome-shaped
camera-based tactile sensor that allows accurate force and tactile sensing in a
single coherent system. The key novelty of the sensor design is as follows.
First, we demonstrate how to build a smooth silicone hemispheric sensing medium
with uniform markers on its curved surface. Second, we enhance the illumination
of the rounded silicone with diffused LEDs. Third, we construct a
force-sensitive mechanical structure in a compact form factor with usage of
springs to accurately perceive forces. Our multi-modal sensor is able to
acquire tactile information from multi-axis forces, local force distribution,
and contact geometry, all in real-time. We apply an end-to-end deep learning
method to process all the information.

					<dc:description>  Severe class imbalance is one of the main conditions that make machine
learning in cybersecurity difficult. A variety of dataset preprocessing methods
have been introduced over the years. These methods modify the training dataset
by oversampling, undersampling or a combination of both to improve the
predictive performance of classifiers trained on this dataset. Although these
methods are used in cybersecurity occasionally, a comprehensive, unbiased
benchmark comparing their performance over a variety of cybersecurity problems
is missing. This paper presents a benchmark of 16 preprocessing methods on six
cybersecurity datasets together with 17 public imbalanced datasets from other
domains. We test the methods under multiple hyperparameter configurations and
use an AutoML system to train classifiers on the preprocessed datasets, which
reduces potential bias from specific hyperparameter or classifier choices.
Special consideration is also given to evaluating the methods using appropriate
performance measures that are good proxies for practical performance in
real-world cybersecurity systems. The main findings of our study are: 1) Most
of the time, a data preprocessing method that improves classification
performance exists. 2) Baseline approach of doing nothing outperformed a large
portion of methods in the benchmark. 3) Oversampling methods generally
outperform undersampling methods. 4) The most significant performance gains are
brought by the standard SMOTE algorithm and more complicated methods provide
mainly incremental improvements at the cost of often worse computational
performance.

					<dc:title>Can We Find Nash Equilibria at a Linear Rate in Markov Games?</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  We study decentralized learning in two-player zero-sum discounted Markov
games where the goal is to design a policy optimization algorithm for either
agent satisfying two properties. First, the player does not need to know the
policy of the opponent to update its policy. Second, when both players adopt
the algorithm, their joint policy converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game.
To this end, we construct a meta algorithm, dubbed as $\texttt{Homotopy-PO}$,
which provably finds a Nash equilibrium at a global linear rate. In particular,
$\texttt{Homotopy-PO}$ interweaves two base algorithms $\texttt{Local-Fast}$
and $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ via homotopy continuation. $\texttt{Local-Fast}$ is
an algorithm that enjoys local linear convergence while $\texttt{Global-Slow}$
is an algorithm that converges globally but at a slower sublinear rate. By
switching between these two base algorithms, $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ essentially
serves as a ``guide'' which identifies a benign neighborhood where
$\texttt{Local-Fast}$ enjoys fast convergence. However, since the exact size of
such a neighborhood is unknown, we apply a doubling trick to switch between
these two base algorithms. The switching scheme is delicately designed so that
the aggregated performance of the algorithm is driven by $\texttt{Local-Fast}$.
Furthermore, we prove that $\texttt{Local-Fast}$ and $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ can
both be instantiated by variants of optimistic gradient descent/ascent (OGDA)
method, which is of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  A modified form of quantum mechanics which includes a new mechanism for
wavefunction collapse is proposed. The collapse provides a solution to the
quantum measurement problem. This modified quantum mechanics is shown to arise
naturally from a fully discrete physics, where all physical quantities are
discrete rather than continuous. We compare the theory to the spontaneous
collapse theories of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber and Pearle, and argue that the new
theory lends itself well to a realist interpretation of the wavefunction.

					<dc:description>  The forecasting of high-dimensional, spatiotemporal nonlinear systems has
made tremendous progress with the advent of model-free machine learning
techniques. However, in real systems it is not always possible to have all the
information needed; only partial information is available for learning and
forecasting. This can be due to insufficient temporal or spatial samplings, to
inaccessible variables or to noisy training data. Here, we show that it is
nevertheless possible to forecast extreme events occurrence in incomplete
experimental recordings from a spatiotemporally chaotic microcavity laser using
reservoir computing. Selecting regions of maximum transfer entropy, we show
that it is possible to get higher forecasting accuracy using nonlocal data vs
local data thus allowing greater warning times, at least twice the time horizon
predicted from the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent.

					<dc:description>  We propose and study the properties of a non-linear electrodynamics that
emerges inspired on the physics of Dirac materials. This new electrodynamic
model is an extension of the one-loop corrected non-linear effective Lagrangian
computed in the work of ref. [3]. In the particular regime of a strong magnetic
and a weak electric field, it reduces to the photonic non-linear model worked
out by the authors of ref. [3]. We pursue our investigation of the proposed
model by analyzing properties of the permittivity and permeability tensors, the
energy-momentum tensor and wave propagation effects in presence of a uniform
magnetic background. It is shown that the electrodynamics here presented
exhibits the vacuum birefringence phenomenon. Subsequently, we calculate the
lowest-order modifications to the interaction energy, considering still the
presence of a uniform external magnetic field. Our analysis is carried out
within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables
formalism. The calculation reveals a screened Coulomb-like potential with an
effective electric charge that runs with the external magnetic field but, as
expected for Dirac-type materials, the screening disappears whenever the
external magnetic field is switched off.

					<dc:description>  In a large variety of systems (biological, physical, social etc.),
synchronization occurs when different oscillating objects tune their rhythm
when they interact with each other. The different underlying network defining
the connectivity properties among these objects drives the global dynamics in a
complex fashion and affects the global degree of synchrony of the system. Here
we study the impact of such types of different network architectures, such as
Fully-Connected, Random, Regular ring lattice graph, Small-World and Scale-Free
in the global dynamical activity of a system of coupled Kuramoto phase
oscillators. We fix the external stimulation parameters and we measure the
global degree of synchrony when different fractions of nodes receive stimulus.
These nodes are chosen either randomly or based on their respective strong/weak
connectivity properties (centrality, shortest path length and clustering
coefficient). Our main finding is, that in Scale-Free and Random networks a
sophisticated choice of nodes based on their eigenvector centrality and average
shortest path length exhibits a systematic trend in achieving higher degree of
synchrony. However, this trend does not occur when using the clustering
coefficient as a criterion. For the other types of graphs considered, the
choice of the stimulated nodes (randomly vs selectively using the
aforementioned criteria) does not seem to have a noticeable effect.

					<dc:description>  We study two-player zero-sum stochastic games, and propose a form of
independent learning dynamics called Doubly Smoothed Best-Response dynamics,
which integrates a discrete and doubly smoothed variant of the best-response
dynamics into temporal-difference (TD)-learning and minimax value iteration.
The resulting dynamics are payoff-based, convergent, rational, and symmetric
among players. Our main results provide finite-sample guarantees. In
particular, we prove the first-known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity bound for payoff-based independent learning dynamics, up to a
smoothing bias. In the special case where the stochastic game has only one
state (i.e., matrix games), we provide a sharper
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity. Our analysis uses a novel
coupled Lyapunov drift approach to capture the evolution of multiple sets of
coupled and stochastic iterates, which might be of independent interest.

					<dc:description>  Various recent methods attempt to implement rotation-invariant 3D deep
learning by replacing the input coordinates of points with relative distances
and angles. Due to the incompleteness of these low-level features, they have to
undertake the expense of losing global information. In this paper, we propose
the CRIN, namely Centrifugal Rotation-Invariant Network. CRIN directly takes
the coordinates of points as input and transforms local points into
rotation-invariant representations via centrifugal reference frames. Aided by
centrifugal reference frames, each point corresponds to a discrete rotation so
that the information of rotations can be implicitly stored in point features.
Unfortunately, discrete points are far from describing the whole rotation
space. We further introduce a continuous distribution for 3D rotations based on
points. Furthermore, we propose an attention-based down-sampling strategy to
sample points invariant to rotations. A relation module is adopted at last for
reinforcing the long-range dependencies between sampled points and predicts the
anchor point for unsupervised rotation estimation. Extensive experiments show
that our method achieves rotation invariance, accurately estimates the object
rotation, and obtains state-of-the-art results on rotation-augmented
classification and part segmentation. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of the network design.

					<dc:description>  The Bethe/Gauge correspondence in \cite{NS09a,NS09b} was extended to 2d
$\text{SO/Sp}$ gauge theories and open $\text{XXX}$ spin chains with diagonal
boundary conditions successfully \cite{KZ21}. In 3d, the $\text{SO}$ gauge
theories correspond to open $\text{XXZ}$ spin chains directly, while the
correspondence between $\text{Sp}$ gauge theories and $\text{XXZ}$ spin chains
does not match very well \cite{KZ21}. For a factor $\text{sin}^2
(2\sigma_{i}\pm \beta_{2}\tilde{c})$ appearing in vacuum equations of 3d
$\text{Sp}$ gauge theory, the Bethe ansatz equations cannot find suitable
boundary conditions to correspond to the vacuum equations. To solve this
problem, we define a kind of new effective superpotential and extend the work
of \cite{NS09a,KZ21} to a Bethe/Gauge correspondence between 2d (and 3d)
$\text{SO/Sp}$ gauge theories and open $\text{XXX}$ (and $\text{XXZ}$) spin
chains with diagonal boundary conditions in this article. Especially, we find
the correspondence between 2d (and 3d) $\text{BC}_{N}$-type gauge theories and
open $\text{XXX}$ (and $\text{XXZ}$) spin chains with diagonal boundary
conditions with some special values of the parameters. For exceptional Lie
algebras $\text{F}_{4}$, $\text{G}_{2}$, we give the effective superpotential
and vacuum equations. For $\text{E}_{6,7,8}$, we only give theirs effective
superpotential for convenience.

					<dc:description>  Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) have become the most desirable
starting point in the field of NLP, as they have become remarkably good at
solving many individual tasks. Despite such success, in this paper, we argue
that current paradigms of working with PLMs are neglecting a critical aspect of
modeling human intelligence: functional compositionality. Functional
compositionality - the ability to compose learned tasks - has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of AI (and many other fields) as it is
considered one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. An illustrative example
of such is cross-lingual summarization, where a bilingual person
(English-French) could directly summarize an English document into French
sentences without having to translate the English document or summary into
French explicitly. We discuss why this matter is an important open problem that
requires further attention from the field. Then, we show that current PLMs
(e.g., GPT-2 and T5) don't have functional compositionality yet and it is far
from human-level generalizability. Finally, we suggest several research
directions that could push the field towards zero-shot functional
compositionality of language models.

					<dc:description>  We start by presenting the general set of structure equations for the 1+3
threading spacetime decomposition in 4 spacetime dimensions, valid for any
theory of gravitation based on a metric compatible affine connection. We then
apply these equations to the study of cosmological solutions of the
Einstein-Cartan theory in which the matter is modeled by a perfect fluid with
intrinsic spin. It is shown that the metric tensor can be described by a
generic FLRW solution. However, due to the presence of torsion the Weyl tensors
might not vanish. The coupling between the torsion and Weyl tensors leads to
the conclusion that, in this cosmological model, the universe must either be
flat or open, excluding definitely the possibility of a closed universe. In the
open case, we derive a wave equation for the traceless part of the magnetic
part of the Weyl tensor and show how the intrinsic spin of matter in a dynamic
universe leads to the generation and emission of gravitational waves. Lastly,
in this cosmological model, it is found that the torsion tensor, which has an
intrinsic spin as its source, contributes to a positive accelerated expansion
of the universe. Comparing the theoretical predictions of the model with the
current experimental data, we conclude that torsion cannot completely replace
the role of a cosmological constant.

					<dc:description>  Deep neural networks facilitate video question answering (VideoQA), but the
real-world applications on video streams such as CCTV and live cast place
higher demands on the solver. To address the challenges of VideoQA on long
videos of unknown length, we define a new set of problems called Online
Open-ended Video Question Answering (O^2VQA). It requires an online
state-updating mechanism for the solver to decide if the collected information
is sufficient to conclude an answer. We then propose a Confidence-based
Event-centric Online Video Question Answering (CEO-VQA) model to solve this
problem. Furthermore, a dataset called Answer Target in Background Stream
(ATBS) is constructed to evaluate this newly developed online VideoQA
application. Compared to the baseline VideoQA method that watches the whole
video, the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a
significant performance gain.

					<dc:description>  Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach
for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory
resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN
model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ)
technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model,
yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization.
Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of
compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on
various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates $\times 19.4$ and
$\times 52.9$ compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models,
respectively, with $&lt;0.4\%$ accuracy degradation. Code:

					<dc:description>  In the study of network synchronization, an outstanding question of both
theoretical and practical significance is how to allocate a given set of
heterogenous oscillators on a complex network in order for improving the
synchronization performance. Whereas methods have been proposed to address this
question in literature, the methods are based on accurate models describing the
system dynamics, which, however, are normally unavailable in realistic
situations. Here we show that this question can be addressed by the model-free
technique of feed-forward neural network (FNN) in machine learning.
Specifically, we measure the synchronization performance of a number of
allocation schemes and use the measured data to train a machine. It is found
that the trained machine is able to not only infer the synchronization
performance of any new allocation scheme, but also find from a huge amount of
candidates the optimal allocation scheme for synchronization.

					<dc:description>  Recently, flat minima are proven to be effective for improving generalization
and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Yet the current definition of flatness discussed in SAM and its follow-ups are
limited to the zeroth-order flatness (i.e., the worst-case loss within a
perturbation radius). We show that the zeroth-order flatness can be
insufficient to discriminate minima with low generalization error from those
with high generalization error both when there is a single minimum or multiple
minima within the given perturbation radius. Thus we present first-order
flatness, a stronger measure of flatness focusing on the maximal gradient norm
within a perturbation radius which bounds both the maximal eigenvalue of
Hessian at local minima and the regularization function of SAM. We also present
a novel training procedure named Gradient norm Aware Minimization (GAM) to seek
minima with uniformly small curvature across all directions. Experimental
results show that GAM improves the generalization of models trained with
current optimizers such as SGD and AdamW on various datasets and networks.
Furthermore, we show that GAM can help SAM find flatter minima and achieve
better generalization.

					<dc:title>On the impossibility of spontaneous vector flavor symmetry breaking on

					<dc:creator>Giordano, Matteo</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Lattice</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  I show that spontaneous breaking of vector flavor symmetry on the lattice is
impossible in gauge theories with a positive functional-integral measure, for
discretized Dirac operators linear in the quark masses, if the corresponding
propagator and its commutator with the flavor symmetry generators can be
bounded in norm independently of the gauge configuration and uniformly in the
volume. Under these assumptions, any order parameter vanishes in the symmetric
limit of fermions of equal masses. I show that these assumptions are satisfied
by staggered, minimally doubled and Ginsparg-Wilson fermions for positive
fermion mass, for any value of the lattice spacing, and so in the continuum
limit if this exists. They are instead not satisfied by Wilson fermions, for
which spontaneous vector flavor symmetry breaking is known to take place in the
Aoki phase. The existence of regularizations unaffected by residual fermion
doubling for which the symmetry cannot break spontaneously on the lattice
establishes rigorously (at the physicist's level) the impossibility of its
spontaneous breaking in the continuum for any number of flavors.

					<dc:description>  Axion-like particles (ALPs) are new particles that extend beyond the standard
model (SM) and are highly motivated. When considering ALPs within an effective
field theory, their couplings with SM particles can be studied independently.
It is a daunting task to search for GeV-scale ALPs coupled to muons in collider
experiments because their coupling is proportional to the muon mass. However, a
recent study by Altmannshofer, Dror, and Gori (2022) highlighted the importance
of a four-point interaction, $W$-$\mu$-$\nu_{\mu}$-$a$, which coupling is not
dependent on the muon mass. This interaction provides a new opportunity to
explore muonphilic ALPs ($\mu$ALPs) at the GeV scale. We concentrate on
$\mu$ALPs generated through this four-point interaction at future $\mu^+\mu^-$
and $\mu p$ colliders that subsequently decay into a pair of muons. This new
channel for exploring $\mu$ALPs with $1$ GeV $\leq m_a\lesssim M_W$ can result
in much stronger future constraints than the existing ones.

					<dc:description>  Program logics for bug-finding (such as the recently introduced Incorrectness
Logic) have framed correctness and incorrectness as dual concepts requiring
different logical foundations. In this paper, we argue that a single unified
theory can be used for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning. We present
Outcome Logic (OL), a novel generalization of Hoare Logic that is both monadic
(to capture computational effects) and monoidal (to reason about outcomes and
reachability). OL expresses true positive bugs, while retaining correctness
reasoning abilities as well. To formalize the applicability of OL to both
correctness and incorrectness, we prove that any false OL specification can be
disproven in OL itself. We also use our framework to reason about new types of
incorrectness in nondeterministic and probabilistic programs. Given these
advances, we advocate for OL as a new foundational theory of correctness and
incorrectness.

					<dc:description>  Systems with time-delayed chaotic dynamics are common in nature, from control
theory to aeronautical propulsion. The overarching objective of this paper is
to compute the stability properties of a chaotic dynamical system, which is
time-delayed. The stability analysis is based only on data. We employ the echo
state network (ESN), a type of recurrent neural network, and train it on
timeseries of a prototypical time-delayed nonlinear thermoacoustic system. By
running the trained ESN autonomously, we show that it can reproduce (i) the
long-term statistics of the thermoacoustic system's variables, (ii) the
physical portion of the Lyapunov spectrum, and (iii) the statistics of the
finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This work opens up the possibility to infer
stability properties of time-delayed systems from experimental observations.

					<dc:description>  The information flow-based quantitative causality analysis has been widely
applied in different disciplines because of its origin from first principles,
its concise form, and its computational efficiency. So far the algorithm for
its estimation is based on differential dynamical systems, which, however, may
make an issue for coarsely sampled time series. Here, we show that for linear
systems, this is fine at least qualitatively; but for highly nonlinear systems,
the bias increases significantly as the sampling frequency is reduced. This
paper provides a partial solution to this problem, showing how causality
analysis is assured faithful with coarsely sampled series when, of course, the
statistics is sufficient. It has been successfully applied to a system
comprising of a pair of nearly synchronized R\&quot;ossler oscillators.

					<dc:description>  Magnetic annealing of the collinear antiferromagnet PdMn with excess Pd
produces strongly pinned magnetic moments in the annealing field direction.
This behaviour can be understood with the help of the magnetic-field-biased
diffusion model. Here, the magnetic field creates an energy difference between
the two possible occupations of the antiferromagnetic Mn-sublattices by the
Pd-excess atoms. This, mediated by diffusion, leads to an imbalance in the
amount of the Pd-excess atoms in these sublattices and, subsequently, to an
imbalance in the total magnetization of the sublattices. We investigate this
effect's dependence on the annealing field, time, and temperature. The results
are then compared to the results of the magnetic-field-biased diffusion model,
which gives good agreement.

					<dc:description>  We consider the system of two parallel sheets of graphene which are moving
with relative parallel velocity $\vec{v}$ and calculate the Casimir energy by
using the scattering approach. The energy has real and imaginary parts. The
real part contains a velocity contribution to the force perpendicular to the
sheets. The imaginary part is related to a friction force parallel to the
graphene sheets. We prove that the friction appears if the relative velocity
becomes greater than the velocity of Fermi and if the modulo of reflection
coefficient is greater than the one which is significant for virtual photon
production. We analyze in detail the real contribution to the Casimir energy
for two systems -- graphene/graphene and ideal metal/graphene. In the
non-relativistic case $v \ll v_F$, the relative correction to the Casimir
energy $(\mathcal{E}_v - \mathcal{E}_0)/\mathcal{E}_0$ is proportional to the
$(v/c)^2$ (the maximum value is $0.0033$ for the gapeless case and $v=v_F$) for
the first system, and it is zero up to the Fermi velocity $v = v_F$ for system
ideal metal/graphene.

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The super-twisting differentiator, also known as the first-order robust exact
differentiator, is a well known sliding mode differentiator. In the absence of
measurement noise, it achieves exact reconstruction of the time derivative of a
function with bounded second derivative. This note proposes an upper bound for
its worst-case differentiation error in the presence of bounded measurement
noise, based on a novel Lyapunov function. It is shown that the bound can be
made arbitrarily tight and never exceeds the true worst-case differentiation
error by more than a factor of two. A numerical simulation further demonstrates
the non-conservativeness of the proposed bound.

					<dc:description>  Although quantum circuits have been ubiquitous for decades in quantum
computing, the first complete equational theory for quantum circuits has only
recently been introduced. Completeness guarantees that any true equation on
quantum circuits can be derived from the equational theory. Our contribution is
twofold: (i) We simplify this equational theory by proving that several rules
can be derived from the remaining ones. In particular, two out of the three
most intricate rules are removed, the third one being slightly simplified. (ii)
We extend the complete equational theory to quantum circuits with ancillae or
qubit discarding, to represent respectively quantum computations using an
additional workspace, and hybrid quantum computations. We show that the
remaining intricate rule can be greatly simplified in these more expressive
settings. The development of simple and complete equational theories for
expressive quantum circuit models opens new avenues for reasoning about quantum
circuits. It provides strong formal foundations for various compiling tasks
such as circuit optimisation, hardware constraint satisfaction and
verification.

					<dc:description>  We investigate how the Raychaudhuri equation behaves in the $k$-essence
geometry. As far as we are concerned, both the early and current epochs of the
universe are relevant to the $k$-essence theory. Here, we have studied the
$k$-essence geometry using the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) variety of non-standard
action. The corresponding $k$-essence emergent spacetime is not conformally
equivalent to the usual gravitational metric. We assume that the background
gravitational metric is of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type
in this case. We have found that both the conditional singular and non-singular
cosmological models of the universe through the modified Raychaudhuri equation
are possible where we have used the spacetime as the flat $k$-essence emergent
FLRW-type. We have also addressed to the Focusing theorem and conditional
caustic universe construction. These conditional effects are caused by the
additional interactions that arise as a result of the coupling that exists
between the gravity and the $k$-essence scalar field.

					<dc:description>  Stellar activity and planetary atmospheric properties have the potential to
strongly influence habitability. To date, neither have been adequately studied
in the multiverse context, so there has been no assessment of how these effects
impact the probabilities of observing our fundamental constants. Here, we
consider the effects of solar wind, mass loss, and extreme ultra-violet (XUV)
flux on planetary atmospheres, how these effects scale with fundamental
constants, and how this affects the likelihood of our observations. We
determine the minimum atmospheric mass that can withstand erosion, maintain
liquid surface water, and buffer diurnal temperature changes. We consider two
plausible sources of Earth's atmosphere, as well as the notion that only
initially slowly rotating stars are habitable, and find that all are equally
compatible with the multiverse. We consider whether planetary magnetic fields
are necessary for habitability, and find five boundaries in parameter space
where magnetic fields are precluded. We find that if an Earth-like
carbon-to-oxygen ratio is required for life, atmospheric effects do not have
much of an impact on multiverse calculations. If significantly different
carbon-to-oxygen ratios are compatible with life, magnetic fields must not be
essential for life, and planet atmosphere must not scale with stellar nitrogen
abundance, or else the multiverse would be ruled out to a high degree of
confidence.

					<dc:description>  We propose a novel formulation of elastic materials based on high-order

conservative. The proposed high-order interpolants can be regarded as a
high-dimensional extension of radial basis functions, and they allow the
interpolation of derivatives of elastic energy, in particular stress and
stiffness. Given the proposed parameterization of elasticity models, we devise
an algorithm to find optimal model parameters based on training data. We have
tested our methodology for the homogenization of 2D microstructures, and we
show that it succeeds to match complex behaviors with high accuracy.

of the span between glass transition, $T_g \approx 55^\circ$C and melting $T_m
\approx 225^\circ$C temperatures. The mechanisms of tensile deformation are
analyzed as a function of the true strain using a combination of
temperature-controlled tensile experiments coupled with 2D digital image

					<dc:description>  We revisit the stellar cooling limits on the light scalar boson whose
coupling to the Standard Model particles is described by its mixing with the
Higgs boson. Strong constraints have been obtained by the electron-nucleus
bremsstrahlung process and the resonant plasma effect in the medium. We find
that the bremsstrahlung contribution by the electron and nucleus scattering is
in similar size to the plasma mixing effect including the off-resonant mixing.
The constraints on the scalar coupling are found to be weaker by about three
orders of magnitude than the previous evaluations. For white dwarfs, the
stellar cooling constraint is even more suppressed due to the Pauli blocking
effect. We obtain the limits on the Higgs-scalar mixing angle of
10^{-10}--10^{-8} in the region where the scalar mass is lighter than about 10
keV.
