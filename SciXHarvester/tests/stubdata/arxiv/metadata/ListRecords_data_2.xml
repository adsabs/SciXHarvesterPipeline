					<dc:description>  Interpretability and human oversight are fundamental pillars of deploying
complex NLP models into real-world applications. However, applying
explainability and human-in-the-loop methods requires technical proficiency.
Despite existing toolkits for model understanding and analysis, options to
integrate human feedback are still limited. We propose IFAN, a framework for
real-time explanation-based interaction with NLP models. Through IFAN's
interface, users can provide feedback to selected model explanations, which is
then integrated through adapter layers to align the model with human rationale.
We show the system to be effective in debiasing a hate speech classifier with
minimal performance loss. IFAN also offers a visual admin system and API to
manage models (and datasets) as well as control access rights. A demo is live

					<dc:description>  For an $m$-edge connected simple graph $G$, finding a spanning tree of $G$
with the maximum number of leaves is MAXSNP-complete. The problem remains
NP-complete even if $G$ is planar and the maximal degree of $G$ is at most
four. Lu and Ravi gave the first known polynomial-time approximation algorithms
with approximation factors $5$ and $3$. Later, they obtained a
$3$-approximation algorithm that runs in near-linear time. The best known
result is Solis-Oba, Bonsma, and Lowski's $O(m)$-time $2$-approximation
algorithm. We show an alternative simple $O(m)$-time $2$-approximation
algorithm whose analysis is simpler. This paper is dedicated to the cherished
memory of our dear friend, Professor Takao Nishizeki.

					<dc:description>  Viewpoint planning is an important task in any application where objects or
scenes need to be viewed from different angles to achieve sufficient coverage.
The mapping of confined spaces such as shelves is an especially challenging
task since objects occlude each other and the scene can only be observed from
the front, thus with limited possible viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a
deep reinforcement learning framework that generates promising views aiming at
reducing the map entropy. Additionally, the pipeline extends standard viewpoint
planning by predicting adequate minimally invasive push actions to uncover
occluded objects and increase the visible space. Using a 2.5D occupancy height
map as state representation that can be efficiently updated, our system decides
whether to plan a new viewpoint or perform a push. To learn feasible pushes, we
use a neural network to sample push candidates on the map and have human
experts manually label them to indicate whether the sampled push is a good
action to perform. As simulated and real-world experimental results with a
robotic arm show, our system is able to significantly increase the mapped space
compared to different baselines, while the executed push actions highly benefit
the viewpoint planner with only minor changes to the object configuration.

					<dc:description>  Keyword spotting (KWS) in historical documents is an important tool for the
initial exploration of digitized collections. Nowadays, the most efficient KWS
methods are relying on machine learning techniques that require a large amount
of annotated training data. However, in the case of historical manuscripts,
there is a lack of annotated corpus for training. To handle the data scarcity
issue, we investigate the merits of the self-supervised learning to extract
useful representations of the input data without relying on human annotations
and then using these representations in the downstream task. We propose
ST-KeyS, a masked auto-encoder model based on vision transformers where the
pretraining stage is based on the mask-and-predict paradigm, without the need
of labeled data. In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained encoder is
integrated into a siamese neural network model that is fine-tuned to improve
feature embedding from the input images. We further improve the image
representation using pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC) embedding to
create and exploit an intermediate representation of images based on text
attributes. In an exhaustive experimental evaluation on three widely used
benchmark datasets (Botany, Alvermann Konzilsprotokolle and George Washington),
the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on the same
datasets.

					<dc:description>  The brain is a complex system whose understanding enables potentially deeper
approaches to mental phenomena. Dynamics of wide classes of complex systems
have been satisfactorily described within $q$-statistics, a current
generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. Here, we study human
electroencephalograms of typical human adults (EEG), very specifically their
inter-occurrence times across an arbitrarily chosen threshold of the signal
(observed, for instance, at the midparietal location in scalp). The
distributions of these inter-occurrence times differ from those usually
emerging within BG statistical mechanics. They are instead well approached
within the $q$-statistical theory, based on non-additive entropies
characterized by the index $q$. The present method points towards a suitable
tool for quantitatively accessing brain complexity, thus potentially opening
useful studies of the properties of both typical and altered brain physiology.

					<dc:description>  This paper studies the effect of reference frame selection in
sensor-to-sensor extrinsic calibration when formulated as a motion-based
hand-eye calibration problem. Different reference selection options are tested
under varying noise conditions in simulation, and the findings are validated
with real data from the KITTI dataset. We propose two nonlinear cost functions
for optimization and compare them with four state-of-the-art methods. One of
the proposed cost functions incorporates outlier rejection to improve
calibration performance and was shown to significantly improve performance in
the presence of outliers, and either match or outperform the other algorithms
in other noise conditions. However, the performance gain from reference frame
selection was deemed larger than that from algorithm selection. In addition, we
show that with realistic noise, the reference frame selection method commonly
used in literature is inferior to other tested options, and that relative error
metrics are not reliable for telling which method achieves best calibration
performance.

					<dc:description>  Using the general parametrization of spherically symmetric and asymptotically
flat black holes in arbitrary metric theories of gravity and implying that: a)
the post-Newtonian constraints are taken into account and b) basic
astrophysically relevant characteristics (such as, dominant quasinormal modes,
frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit, binding energy, radius of the
shadow etc.) are indistinguishable from their Schwarzschild values, we propose
a simple metric which depends on three independent parameters (coefficients of
the parametrization). Variation of these three parameters can, nevertheless,
lead to the two distinctive features. The first is the black-hole temperature,
and consequently the Hawking radiation, which can differ a lot from its
Schwarzschild limit. The second is the outburst of overtones which become
extremely sensitive to small changes of the parameters.

					<dc:description>  Cross-modal learning of video and text plays a key role in Video Question
Answering (VideoQA). In this paper, we propose a visual-text attention
mechanism to utilize the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trained
on lots of general domain language-image pairs to guide the cross-modal
learning for VideoQA. Specifically, we first extract video features using a
TimeSformer and text features using a BERT from the target application domain,
and utilize CLIP to extract a pair of visual-text features from the
general-knowledge domain through the domain-specific learning. We then propose
a Cross-domain Learning to extract the attention information between visual and
linguistic features across the target domain and general domain. The set of
CLIP-guided visual-text features are integrated to predict the answer. The
proposed method is evaluated on MSVD-QA and MSRVTT-QA datasets, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

					<dc:description>  The goal of entity resolution is to identify records in multiple datasets
that represent the same real-world entity. However, comparing all records
across datasets can be computationally intensive, leading to long runtimes. To
reduce these runtimes, entity resolution pipelines are constructed of two
parts: a blocker that applies a computationally cheap method to select
candidate record pairs, and a matcher that afterwards identifies matching pairs
from this set using more expensive methods. This paper presents SC-Block, a
blocking method that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for positioning
records in the embedding space, and nearest neighbour search for candidate set
building. We benchmark SC-Block against eight state-of-the-art blocking
methods. In order to relate the training time of SC-Block to the reduction of
the overall runtime of the entity resolution pipeline, we combine SC-Block with
four matching methods into complete pipelines. For measuring the overall
runtime, we determine candidate sets with 98% pair completeness and pass them
to the matcher. The results show that SC-Block is able to create smaller
candidate sets and pipelines with SC-Block execute 1.5 to 2 times faster
compared to pipelines with other blockers, without sacrificing F1 score.
Blockers are often evaluated using relatively small datasets which might lead
to runtime effects resulting from a large vocabulary size being overlooked. In
order to measure runtimes in a more challenging setting, we introduce a new
benchmark dataset that requires large numbers of product offers to be blocked.
On this large-scale benchmark dataset, pipelines utilizing SC-Block and the
best-performing matcher execute 8 times faster than pipelines utilizing another
blocker with the same matcher reducing the runtime from 2.5 hours to 18
minutes, clearly compensating for the 5 minutes required for training SC-Block.

					<dc:description>  Dynamical systems with prescribed-time convergence often feature a right-hand
side exhibiting a singularity at the prescribed convergence time instant. In an
open neighborhood of this singularity, classical absolutely continuous Filippov
solutions may fail to exist, preventing indefinite continuation of such
solutions for some prescribed-time systems. This note introduces a generalized
Filippov solution definition based on the notion of restricted absolute
continuity in the generalized sense. Conditions for the continuability of such
generalized solutions are presented and it is shown, in particular, that
generalized Filippov solutions of systems with an equilibrium that is
attractive, in prescribed time or otherwise, can always be continued
indefinitely.

					<dc:description>  This paper is about Dirichlet averages in the matrix-variate case or averages
of functions over the Dirichlet measure in the complex domain. The classical
power mean contains the harmonic mean, arithmetic mean and geometric mean
(Hardy, Littlewood and Polya), which is generalized to $y$-mean by deFinetti
and hypergeometric mean by Carlson, see the references herein. Carlson's
hypergeometric mean is to average a scalar function over a real scalar variable
type-1 Dirichlet measure and this in the current literature is known as
Dirichlet average of that function. The idea is examined when there is a type-1
or type-2 Dirichlet density in the complex domain. Averages of several
functions are computed in such Dirichlet densities in the complex domain.
Dirichlet measures are defined when the matrices are Hermitian positive
definite. Some applications are also discussed.

					<dc:description>  By means of high-temperature series expansions we study the singularities of
the specific heat ($c_v$) and the magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) of $S=1/2$
models presenting a phase transition belonging to the three dimensional
Heisenberg universality class. We first calculate the critical temperature
$T_c$ and the critical exponent $\gamma$ using the standard Dlog Pad\'e method
on $\overline{\chi}(\beta)=\chi(\beta)/\beta$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg
model on the face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic, pyrochlore
and semi-simple cubic lattices ($\beta=1/T$). We also explore the possibility
of using this method on $\overline{\chi}(e)$ and $c_v(\beta)$ to calculate the
critical energy $e_c$ and the critical exponent $\alpha$. Finally, we adapt a
method initially developed for logarithmic singularities
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.165113}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf104},
165113 (2021)}] to cusp ($-1&lt;\alpha&lt;0$) and divergent singularities
($\gamma&gt;0$), and propose different interpolation methods for $c_v$ and $\chi$.
We apply our method to several of the previously mentioned lattices and present
for each the reconstructed $c_v$ and $\chi$ down to $T_c$.

					<dc:description>  Monitoring the rock-physics properties of the subsurface is of great
importance for reservoir management. For either oil and gas applications or CO2
storage, seismic data are a valuable source of information for tracking changes
in elastic properties which can be related to fluids saturation and pressure
changes within the reservoir. Changes in elastic properties can be estimated
with time-lapse full-waveform inversion (TL-FWI). Monitoring rock-physics
properties, such as saturation, with TL-FWI is usually a two-step process:
first, elastic properties are estimated with full-waveform inversion (FWI),
then, the rock-physics properties are estimated with rock-physics inversion.
However, multiparameter TL-FWI is prone to crosstalk between parameter classes
across different vintages. This leads to leakage from one parameter class to
another, which, in turn, can introduce large errors in the estimated
rock-physics parameters. To avoid inaccuracies caused by crosstalk and the
two-step inversion strategy, we reformulate TL-FWI to estimate directly the
changes in the rock-physics properties. Using Gassmann's model, we adopt a new
parameterization containing porosity, clay content, and water saturation (PCS).
In the context of reservoir monitoring, changes are assumed to be induced by
fluid substitution only. The porosity and clay content can thus be kept
constant during time-lapse inversion. We compare the PCS parameterization with
the usual density-velocity (DV) parameterization for different benchmark
models. Results indicate that the proposed parameterization eliminates
crosstalk between parameters of different vintages, leading to more accurate
estimation of saturation changes. We also show that using the PCS
parameterization, the elastic changes can be monitored more accurately.

					<dc:description>  The presence of delayed GeV emission after a strong transient, such as a GRB
(Gamma-Ray Burst), in the VHE (Very-High Energy, $E&gt;100$ GeV) band can be the
signature of a non-zero magnetic field in the intergalactic medium. We used a
synchrotron self-Compton multiwavelength model to infer an analytical
description of the intrinsic VHE spectrum (corrected for absorption by the
Extragalactic Background Light, EBL) of GRB$\,$190114C to predict the
lightcurves and SEDs of the delayed emission with Monte Carlo simulations for
different IGMF (Intergalactic Magnetic Field) configurations (strengths
$B=8\times10^{-21}$ G, $10^{-20}$ G, $3\times 10^{-20}$G and correlation length
$\lambda&gt;1$ Mpc), and compared them with the Fermi-LAT (Fermi Large Area
Telescope) limits computed for several exposure times. We found that Fermi LAT
is not sensitive enough to constrain any IGMF strengths using GRB$\,$190114C.

					<dc:description>  Let $f(x)=x^n+ax^2+bx+c \in \Z[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial with
$b^2=4ac$ and let $K=\Q(\theta)$ be an algebraic number field defined by a
complex root $\theta$ of $f(x)$. Let $\Z_K$ deonote the ring of algebraic
integers of $K$. The aim of this paper is to provide the necessary and
sufficient conditions involving only $a,c$ and $n$ for a given prime $p$ to
divide the index of the subgroup $\Z[\theta]$ in $\Z_K$. As a consequence, we
provide families of monogenic algebraic number fields. Further, when $\Z_K \neq
\Z[\theta]$, we determine explicitly the index $[\Z_K : \Z[\theta]]$ in some
cases.

					<dc:description>  Powerful artificial intelligence poses an existential threat if the AI
decides to drastically change the world in pursuit of its goals. The hope of
low-impact artificial intelligence is to incentivize AI to not do that just
because this causes a large impact in the world. In this work, we first review
the concept of low-impact agency and previous proposals to approach the
problem, and then propose future research directions in the topic, with the
goal to ensure low-impactedness is useful in making AI safe.

					<dc:description>  Medical devices and artificial intelligence systems rapidly transform
healthcare provisions. At the same time, due to their nature, AI in or as
medical devices might get exposed to cyberattacks, leading to patient safety
and security risks. This book chapter is divided into three parts. The first
part starts by setting the scene where we explain the role of cybersecurity in
healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI that
is considered a medical device by itself or supports one. To illustrate the
risks such medical devices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of
datasets, social engineering, and data or source code extraction. In the second
part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union's regulatory
framework relevant for ensuring the cybersecurity of AI as or in medical
devices (MDR, NIS Directive, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, the AI Act proposal and
the NIS 2 Directive proposal). Finally, the third part of the paper examines
possible challenges stemming from the EU regulatory framework. In particular,
we look toward the challenges deriving from the two legislative proposals and
their interaction with the existing legislation concerning AI medical devices'
cybersecurity. They are structured as answers to the following questions: (1)
how will the AI Act interact with the MDR regarding the cybersecurity and
safety requirements?; (2) how should we interpret incident notification
requirements from the NIS 2 Directive proposal and MDR?; and (3) what are the
consequences of the evolving term of critical infrastructures?

					<dc:description>  We present a case study on the strategic planning of a security operations
center in a typical, modern, mid-size organization. Against the backdrop of the
company's multi-cloud strategy a distributed approach envisioning the
involvement of external providers is taken. From a security-centric abstraction
of the organizational IT-landscape, a novel strategic planning method for
security operation centers is developed with an adaptable relationship matrix
as core tool. The method is put to a practical test in modeling different
levels of engagement of external providers in the center's operation. It is
shown that concrete output, such as a core statement of work for an external
provider, can easily be derived.

					<dc:description>  The large scale limit of the galaxy power spectrum provides a unique window
into the early Universe through a possible detection of scale dependent bias
produced by Primordial Non Gaussianities. On such large scales, relativistic
effects could become important and, potentially, be confused for a primordial
signal. In this work we provide the first consistent estimate of such effects
in the observed galaxy power spectrum, and discuss their possible degeneracy
with local Primordial Non Gaussianities. We also clarify the physical
differences between the two signatures, as revealed by their different
sensitivity to the large scale gravitational potential. In particular, we
discuss the absence of large scale divergences, for a Gaussian Universe, in the
observed power spectrum of any tracer of the Large Scale Structure, and their
relation to the the consistency relations of Inflation. Our results indicate
that, while relativistic effects could easily account for 10% of the observed
power spectrum, the subset of those with a similar scale dependence to a
primordial signal can be safely ignored for current galaxy surveys, but it will
become relevant for future observational programs.

					<dc:title>Efficient Domination in Lattice graphs</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>05C69, 05B40</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Given a graph $G$, a subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ is an efficient dominating
set ($EDS$) if $|N[v] \cap S|=1,$ for all $v\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ is
efficiently dominatable if it possesses an $EDS$. The efficient domination
number of G is denoted by F(G) and is defined to be $\max \left\{\sum_{v \in
S}(1 + \operatorname{deg} v):\right.$ $\left.S \subseteq V(G)\right.$ and
$\left.|N[x] \cap S| \leq 1, \forall~ x \in V(G)\right\}$. In general, not
every graph is efficiently dominatable. Further, the class of efficiently
dominatable graphs has not been completely characterized and the problem of
determining whether or not a graph is efficiently dominatable is NP-Complete.
Hence, interest is shown to study the efficient domination property for graphs
under restricted conditions or special classes of graphs. In this paper, we
study the notion of efficient domination in some Lattice graphs, namely,
rectangular grid graphs ($P_m \Box P_n$), triangular grid graphs, and hexagonal
grid graphs.

					<dc:description>  Recently, large-scale Vision and Language (V\&amp;L) pretraining has become the
standard backbone of many multimedia systems. While it has shown remarkable
performance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive
to humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the
input, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it
comes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\&amp;L pretrained
models, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its
pronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding
that utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP
text encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based
embedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation
encoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative
evaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space
represents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed
phoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm
that the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text
encoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more
phonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies
the correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception
regarding pronunciation similarity.

					<dc:description>  We report $^{139}$La nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on a
single-crystal sample of La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$ under uniaxial
stress. The spin order is shown to be more robust than at $x = 0.115$ doping,
however, for magnetic field $H$ in the $c$ direction and the stress applied
along the [110] direction ($\sigma_{[110]}$) the spin order transition
temperature $T_{\text{SO}}$ is rapidly suppressed. This is in stark contrast to
the behavior with stress in [100] direction ($\sigma_{[100]}$), which has
virtually no effect on $T_{\text{SO}}$. For $H \parallel [1\overline{1}0]$,
$\sigma_{[110]}$ stress has a weakened effect, and the rate $d T_\text{SO}/d
\sigma_\text{[110]}$ is drastically reduced. Thus, $H\parallel
[1\overline{1}0]$ acts as a stabilizing factor for spin-stripe order.
  Also, the onset temperature of the low-temperature tetragonal crystal
structure $T_{\text{LTT}}$ is essentially unaffected by [110] stress, while it
decreases slowly under compression along [100].
  We develop a Landau free energy model and interpret our findings as an
interplay of symmetry-breaking terms driven by the orientation of spins. These
findings put constraints on the applicability of theoretical models for the
development of spin-stripe order.

					<dc:title>A survey of classical results on harmonic maps</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Wang, Wei</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Analysis of PDEs</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Harmonic maps are nonlinear extensions of harmonic functions. They are
critical points of natural energy functionals between Riemannian manifolds.
Such type of problems appear in Physics, Geometry of Finance and the study of
regularity and singularity uses methods from elliptic PDE, calculus of
variations and geometric measure theory. In this paper, we present a general
review of harmonic maps. It is a survey that aims to cover the main classical
known results regarding the harmonic maps. We present results for the
regularity, blow-ups and rectifiability for local minimizers, stationary
harmonic maps and weakly harmonic maps.

					<dc:description>  Using first-principle numerical simulations of the lattice SU(3) gauge
theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating
gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative
value below the &quot;supervortical temperature&quot; $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at
$T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative
moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We
derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show
how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The
rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the
rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.

					<dc:description>  This is an exposition of the contributions of L\'aszl\'o Lov\'asz to
mathematics and computer science written on the occasion of the bestowal of the
Abel Prize~2021 to him. Our survey, of course, cannot be exhaustive. We sketch
remarkable results that solved well-known open and important problems and that
-- in addition -- had lasting impact on the development of subsequent research
and even started whole new theories. Although discrete mathematics is what one
can call the Lov\'asz home turf, his interests were, from the beginning of his
academic career, much broader. He employed algebra, geometry, topology,
analysis, stochastics, statistical physics, optimization, and complexity
theory, to name a few, to contribute significantly to the explosive growth of
combinatorics; but he also exported combinatorial techniques to many other
fields, and thus built enduring bridges between several branches of mathematics
and computer science. Topics such as computational convexity or topological
combinatorics, for example, would not exist without his fundamental results. We
also briefly mention his substantial influence on various developments in
applied mathematics such as the optimization of real-world applications and
cryptography.

					<dc:description>  The MIR blend fluxes correlation between HCN and water can be explained as a
consequence of dust evolution, namely, changes in the dust MIR opacity. Other
disk properties, such as the disk inner radius and the disk flaring angle, can
only partially cover the dynamic range of the HCN and water blend observations.
At the same time, the dynamic range of the MIR SED slopes is better reproduced
by the disk structure (e.g. inner radius, flaring) than by the dust evolution.
Our model series do not reproduce the observed trend between continuum flux at
850 {\mu}m and the MIR HCN/H2O blend ratio. However, our models show that this
continuum flux is not a unique indicator of disk mass and it should therefore
be used jointly with complementary observational data for optimal results. The
presence of an anti-correlation between MIR H2O blend fluxes and the MIR SED is
consistent with a scenario where dust evolves in disks, producing lower opacity
and stronger features in the Spitzer spectral regime, while the gas eventually
becomes depleted at a later stage, leaving behind an inner cavity in the disk.

					<dc:description>  Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in a giant flare of a strongly
magnetized neutron star (magnetar), are carrying crucial information for
extracting the neutron star properties. The aim of the study is to constrain
the mass and radius of the neutron star model for GRB 200415A, by identifying
the observed QPOs with the crustal torsional oscillations together with the
experimental constraints on the nuclear matter properties. The frequencies of
the crustal torsional oscillations are determined by solving the eigenvalue
problem with the Cowling approximation, assuming a magnetic field of about
$10^{15}$G. We find that the observed QPOs can be identified with several
overtones of crustal oscillations, for carefully selected combinations of the
nuclear saturation parameters. Thus, we can inversely constrain the neutron
star mass and radius for GRB 200415A by comparing them to the values of nuclear
saturation parameters obtained from terrestrial experiments. We impose further
constraints on the neutron star mass and radius while the candidate neutron
star models are consistent with the constraints obtained from other available
astronomical and experimental observations.

					<dc:description>  Cyber deception can be a valuable addition to traditional cyber defense
mechanisms, especially for modern cloud-native environments with a fading
security perimeter. However, pre-built decoys used in classical computer
networks are not effective in detecting and mitigating malicious actors due to
their inability to blend with the variety of applications in such environments.
On the other hand, decoys cloning the deployed microservices of an application
can offer a high-fidelity deception mechanism to intercept ongoing attacks
within production environments. However, to fully benefit from this approach,
it is essential to use a limited amount of decoy resources and devise a
suitable cloning strategy to minimize the impact on legitimate services
performance. Following this observation, we formulate a non-linear integer
optimization problem that maximizes the number of attack paths intercepted by
the allocated decoys within a fixed resource budget. Attack paths represent the
attacker's movements within the infrastructure as a sequence of violated
microservices. We also design a heuristic decoy placement algorithm to
approximate the optimal solution and overcome the computational complexity of
the proposed formulation. We evaluate the performance of the optimal and
heuristic solutions against other schemes that use local vulnerability metrics
to select which microservices to clone as decoys. Our results show that the
proposed allocation strategy achieves a higher number of intercepted attack
paths compared to these schemes while requiring approximately the same number
of decoys.

					<dc:description>  At present, electric shared micromobility services (ESMS) have become an
important part of the mobility as a service (MaaS) paradigm for sustainable
transportation systems. However, current ESMS suffer from critical design
issues such as a lack of integration, transparency and user-centric approaches,
resulting in high operational costs and poor service quality. A key operational
challenge in ESMS is related to parking, particularly how to ensure a shared
vehicle has a parking space when the user is approaching the destination. For
instance, our recent study illustrated that up to 12.9% of shared E-bike users
in Dublin, Ireland cannot park their E-bikes properly due to a lack of planning
and user-centric guidance. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose
U-Park, a user-centric smart parking recommendation system for ESMS aiming at
making personalised recommendations to ESMS users by considering a given user's
historical mobility data, current trip trajectory and parking space
availability. We propose the system architecture, implement it, and evaluate
its performance based on a real-world dataset from an Irish-based shared E-bike
company, Moby bikes. Our results illustrate that U-Park can effectively predict
a user's destination in a shared E-bike system with around 97.33% accuracy
without direct user inputs, and such results can be subsequently used to
recommend the best parking station for the user depending on the availability
of predicted parking spaces. Finally, a blockchain-empowered module is blended
to manage various transactions due to its advantage in safety and transparency
in this process, including prepays and parking fines.

					<dc:description>  Gear assembly is an essential but challenging task in industrial automation.
This paper presents a novel two-stage approach for achieving high-precision and
flexible gear assembly. The proposed approach integrates YOLO to coarsely
localize the workpiece in a searching phase and deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) to complete the insertion. Specifically, DRL addresses the challenge of
partial visibility when the on-wrist camera is too close to the workpiece.
Additionally, force feedback is used to smoothly transit the process from the
first phase to the second phase. To reduce the data collection effort for
training deep neural networks, we use synthetic RGB images for training YOLO
and construct an offline interaction environment leveraging sampled real-world
data for training DRL agents. We evaluate the proposed approach in a gear
assembly experiment with a precision tolerance of 0.3mm. The results show that
our method can robustly and efficiently complete searching and insertion from
arbitrary positions within an average of 15 seconds.

					<dc:description>  Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that their thermal stability
originates from the nontrivial topology in nature. Recently, a plethora of
topological spin textures have been theoretically predicted or experimentally
observed, enriching the diversity of the skyrmionic family. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate the stabilities of various topological spin textures
against homochiral states in chiral magnets, including chiral bobbers, dipole
strings, and skyrmion tubes. They can be effectively classified by the
associated topological Hall signals. Multiple transition paths are found among
these textures, mediated by Bloch-point singularities, and the topological
protection property here can be manifested by a finite energy barrier with the
saddle point corresponding to the Bloch-point creation/destruction. By
carefully modulating the local property of a surface, such as interfacial DMI
induced by breaking the structural symmetry, the energy landscape of a magnetic
system can be tailored decisively. Significantly, the proposed scenario also
enables the manipulation of stabilities and transition barriers of these
textures, even accompanied by the discovery of ground-state chiral bobbers.
This study may raise great expectations on the coexistence of topological spin
textures as spintronics-based information carriers for future applications.

					<dc:description>  We propose a solution for Active Visual Search of objects in an environment,
whose 2D floor map is the only known information. Our solution has three key
features that make it more plausible and robust to detector failures compared
to state-of-the-art methods: (i) it is unsupervised as it does not need any
training sessions. (ii) During the exploration, a probability distribution on
the 2D floor map is updated according to an intuitive mechanism, while an
improved belief update increases the effectiveness of the agent's exploration.
(iii) We incorporate the awareness that an object detector may fail into the
aforementioned probability modelling by exploiting the success statistics of a
specific detector. Our solution is dubbed POMP-BE-PD (Pomcp-based Online Motion
Planning with Belief by Exploration and Probabilistic Detection). It uses the
current pose of an agent and an RGB-D observation to learn an optimal search
policy, exploiting a POMDP solved by a Monte-Carlo planning approach. On the
Active Vision Database benchmark, we increase the average success rate over all
the environments by a significant 35% while decreasing the average path length
by 4% with respect to competing methods. Thus, our results are
state-of-the-art, even without using any training procedure.

while considering vehicle routing. Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem
with Time Windows (FSMVRPTW). The metaheuristic and exact algorithms are
implemented in a parallel hybrid optimization algorithm where the metaheuristic
rapidly finds feasible solutions that provide candidate upper bounds for the
B&amp;B algorithm which runs simultaneously. The MCTS additionally provides a
candidate fleet composition to initiate the B&amp;B search. Experiments show that
the proposed approach results in significant improvements in computation time
and convergence to the optimal solution.

					<dc:description>  Recent advances in learning-based control leverage deep function
approximators, such as neural networks, to model the evolution of controlled
dynamical systems over time. However, the problem of learning a dynamics model
and a stabilizing controller persists, since the synthesis of a stabilizing
feedback law for known nonlinear systems is a difficult task, let alone for
complex parametric representations that must be fit to data. To this end, we
propose a method for jointly learning parametric representations of a nonlinear
dynamics model and a stabilizing controller from data. To do this, our approach
simultaneously learns a parametric Lyapunov function which intrinsically
constrains the dynamics model to be stabilizable by the learned controller. In
addition to the stabilizability of the learned dynamics guaranteed by our novel
construction, we show that the learned controller stabilizes the true dynamics
under certain assumptions on the fidelity of the learned dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a variety of simulated nonlinear
dynamical systems.

\cite{Gomes2023}. In the present work, we report the emergence of dynamical
hysteresis in a simple second-order non-autonomous chaotic system. The
{\it{Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua }} (MLC) circuit is studied for the evolution of
hysteresis in its dynamics. Numerical simulation and electronic circuit
experimental results are presented for the hysteresis behavior and are
validated through explicit analytical solutions. The observation of dynamical
hysteresis in second-order non-autonomous systems is reported in the literature
for the first time.

					<dc:description>  One of the most crucial areas of gravity research, after the direct
observation of gravitational waves, is the possible modification of General
Relativity at ultraviolet and infrared scales. In particular, the possibility
of parity violation should be considered in strong field regime. The
Chern-Simons gravity takes into account parity violation in strong gravity
regime. For all conformally flat spacetimes and spacetimes with a maximally
symmetric two-dimensional subspace, Chern-Simons gravity is identical to
General Relativity. Specifically, the Anti-de Sitter (A)dS-Kerr/Kerr black hole
is not a solution for Chern-Simons gravity. The slow-rotating BH and the
quadratic order in spin solutions are some of the known solutions to quadratic
order in spin and they are rotating solutions in the frame of dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity.
  In the present study, for the (A)dS slow-rotating situation (correct to the
first order in spin), we derive the linear perturbation equations controlling
the metric and the dynamical Chern-Simons field equation corrected to the
linear order in spin and to the second order in the Chern-Simons coupling
parameter. We show that the black hole of the (A)dS-Kerr solution is stronger
(i.e. more compact and energetic) than the Kerr black hole solution and the
reason for this feature comes form contributions at Planck scales. Moreover, we
calculate the thermodynamical quantities related to this black hole. Finally,
we calculate the geodesic equation and derive the effective potential of the
black hole.

					<dc:title>On the sizes of ionized bubbles around the highest redshift galaxies.
  Spectral shapes of the Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies III</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Hayes, Matthew J.</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We develop a new method to determine the distance between a galaxy and a
foreground screen of atomic hydrogen. In a partially neutral universe, and
under the assumption of spherical symmetry, this equates to the radius of a
ionized 'bubble' (Rbub) surrounding the galaxy. The method requires an observed
Lya equivalent width, velocity offset from systemic, and an input Lya profile
for which we adopt scaled versions of the profiles observed in low-z galaxies.
We demonstrate the technique in a sample of 21 galaxies at redshift z&gt;6,
including six at z=7.2-10.6 recently observed with JWST. Our model estimates
the emergent Lya properties, and the foreground distance to the absorbing IGM.
We find that galaxies at z&gt;7.5 exist in smaller bubbles (~1 pMpc) than those at
z&lt;7. With a relationship that is secure at 3-sigma, we empirically demonstrate
the growth of ionized regions during the reionization epoch for the first time.
We independently estimate the upper limit on the Stromgren radii (Rstrom), and
derive the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the ratio of Rbub/Rstrom,
finding a median value of 17% which on average can provide the photon budget
necessary for reionization.

					<dc:description>  The primitive Wigner-Seitz cell and corresponding first Brillouin zone (FBZ)
are typically used in calculations of lattice vibrational and transport
properties as they contain the smallest number of degrees of freedom and thus
have the cheapest computational cost. However, in complex materials, the FBZ
can take on irregular shapes where lattice symmetries are not apparent. Thus,
conventional cells (with more atoms and regular shapes) are often used to
describe materials, though dynamical and transport calculations are more
expensive. Here we discuss an efficient anharmonic lattice dynamic method that
maps conventional cell dynamics to primitive cell dynamics based on
translational symmetries. This leads to phase interference conditions that act
like conserved quantum numbers and a conservation rule for phonon scattering
that is hidden in conventional dynamics which significantly reduces
computational cost. We demonstrate this method for phonon transport in a
variety of materials with inputs from first-principles calculations and
attribute its efficiency to reduced scattering phase space and fewer summations
in scattering matrix element calculations.

  Literature Review</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Daoui, Marouane</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Economics - General Economics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This article conducts a literature review on the topic of monetary policy in
developing countries and focuses on the effectiveness of monetary policy in
promoting economic growth and the relationship between monetary policy and
economic growth. The literature review finds that the activities of central
banks in developing countries are often overlooked by economic models, but
recent studies have shown that there are many factors that can affect the
effectiveness of monetary policy in these countries. These factors include the
profitability of central banks and monetary unions, the independence of central
banks in their operations, and lags, rigidities, and disequilibrium analysis.
The literature review also finds that studies on the topic have produced mixed
results, with some studies finding that monetary policy has a limited or
non-existent impact on economic growth and others finding that it plays a
crucial role. The article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
current state of research in this field and to identify areas for future study.

					<dc:description>  Increasing our knowledge of the orbits and compositions of Near-Earth Objects
(NEOs) is important for a better understanding of the evolution of the Solar
System and of life. The detection of serendipitous NEO appearances among the
millions of archived exposures from large astronomical imaging surveys can
provide a contribution which is complementary to NEO surveys. Using the
AstroWISE information system, this work aims to assess the detectability rate,
the achieved recovery rate and the quality of astrometry when data mining the
ESO archive for the OmegaCAM wide-field imager at the VST. We developed an
automatic pipeline that searches for the NEO appearances inside the AstroWISE
environment. Throughout the recovery process, the pipeline uses several public
web-tools to identify possible images that overlap with the position of NEOs,
and acquires information on the NEOs predicted position and other properties
(e.g., magnitude, rate and direction of motion) at the time of observations. We
have recovered 196 appearances of NEOs from a set of 968 appearances predicted
to be recoverable. It includes appearances for three NEOs which were on the
impact risk list at that point. These appearances were well before their
discovery. The subsequent risk assessment using the extracted astrometry
removes these NEOs from the risk list. We estimate a detectability rate of 0.05
per NEO at an SNR&gt;3 for NEOs in the OmegaCAM archive. Our automatic recovery
rates are 40% and 20% for NEOs on the risk list and the full list,
respectively. The achieved astrometric and photometric accuracy is on average
0.12 arcsec and 0.1 mag. These results show the high potential of the archival
imaging data of the ground-based wide-field surveys as useful instruments for
the search, (p)recovery and characterization of NEOs. Highly automated
approaches, as possible using AstroWISE, make this undertaking feasible.

					<dc:description>  Patent classification is an essential task in patent information management
and patent knowledge mining. It is very important to classify patents related
to artificial intelligence, which is the biggest topic these days. However,
artificial intelligence-related patents are very difficult to classify because
it is a mixture of complex technologies and legal terms. Moreover, due to the
unsatisfactory performance of current algorithms, it is still mostly done
manually, wasting a lot of time and money. Therefore, we present a method for
classifying artificial intelligence-related patents published by the USPTO
using natural language processing technique and deep learning methodology. We
use deformed BERT and sentence attention overcome the limitations of BERT. Our
experiment result is highest performance compared to other deep learning
methods.

					<dc:description>  Temporal action localization in videos presents significant challenges in the
field of computer vision. While the boundary-sensitive method has been widely
adopted, its limitations include incomplete use of intermediate and global
information, as well as an inefficient proposal feature generator. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Sparse Multilevel Boundary
Generator (SMBG), which enhances the boundary-sensitive method with boundary
classification and action completeness regression. SMBG features a multi-level
boundary module that enables faster processing by gathering boundary
information at different lengths. Additionally, we introduce a sparse
extraction confidence head that distinguishes information inside and outside
the action, further optimizing the proposal feature generator. To improve the
synergy between multiple branches and balance positive and negative samples, we
propose a global guidance loss. Our method is evaluated on two popular
benchmarks, ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and is shown to achieve
state-of-the-art performance, with a better inference speed (2.47xBSN++,
2.12xDBG). These results demonstrate that SMBG provides a more efficient and
simple solution for generating temporal action proposals. Our proposed
framework has the potential to advance the field of computer vision and enhance
the accuracy and speed of temporal action localization in video analysis.The

					<dc:description>  Reliability is probability of success in a success-failure experiment.
Confidence in reliability estimate improves with increasing number of samples.
Assurance sets confidence level same as reliability to create one number for
easier communication. Assuming binomial distribution for the samples,
closed-form expression exists only for calculating confidence. The Wilson Score
interval with continuity correction provides approximate closed-form expression
for reliability. Brent's method was found to provide fast and accurate estimate
for both reliability and assurance computations. Graphs and tables are provided
for several number of samples. Two open-source python libraries are introduced
for computing reliability, confidence, and assurance.

					<dc:description>  Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated during solar eruptions, are
observed to rapidly reach a wide heliolongitudinal range in the interplanetary
space. To access these locations, the SEPs must have either been accelerated at
a wide particle source, or propagated across the mean Parker spiral magnetic
field. We study the propagation of SEPs in a new model of heliospheric
turbulence which takes the spiral geometry of the average magnetic field into
account, to evaluate how this improved description affects the SEP path lengths
and the overall evolution of SEP intensities at 1~au. We use full-orbit test
particle simulations of 100-MeV protons in a turbulence model dominated by
modes that are transverse and 2D with respect to the Parker spiral. We find
that the SEPs spread along the meandering field lines to arrive at a 60$^\circ$
heliolongitudinal range at 1~au within an hour of their injection at the Sun,
consistent with the extent of the meandering field lines. The SEP onset times
are asymmetric with respect to the location connected to the source along the
Parker spiral, with westward locations seeing earlier arrival and higher peak
intensity. The inferred path length of the first-arriving SEPs is 1.5-1.7~au,
30-50\% longer than the Parker spiral, and 20\% longer than the length of the
meandering field lines. Subsequently, the SEP distribution broadens, consistent
with diffusive spreading of SEPs across the field lines. Our results indicate
that SEPs can propagate rapidly across the mean Parker Spiral field to arrive
at wide range of longitudes, even without a wide particle source. The modelled
SEP onset times, the peak intensity and subsequent heliolongitudinal evolution
replicate several observed SEP event features. Further studies are be required
to investigate the relative importance of interplanetary transport and source
size in different turbulence environments.

					<dc:description>  Important research efforts have focused on the design and training of neural
networks with a controlled Lipschitz constant. The goal is to increase and
sometimes guarantee the robustness against adversarial attacks. Recent
promising techniques draw inspirations from different backgrounds to design
1-Lipschitz neural networks, just to name a few: convex potential layers derive
from the discretization of continuous dynamical systems,
Almost-Orthogonal-Layer proposes a tailored method for matrix rescaling.
However, it is today important to consider the recent and promising
contributions in the field under a common theoretical lens to better design new
and improved layers. This paper introduces a novel algebraic perspective
unifying various types of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, including the ones
previously mentioned, along with methods based on orthogonality and spectral
methods. Interestingly, we show that many existing techniques can be derived
and generalized via finding analytical solutions of a common semidefinite
programming (SDP) condition. We also prove that AOL biases the scaled weight to
the ones which are close to the set of orthogonal matrices in a certain
mathematical manner. Moreover, our algebraic condition, combined with the
Gershgorin circle theorem, readily leads to new and diverse parameterizations
for 1-Lipschitz network layers. Our approach, called SDP-based Lipschitz Layers
(SLL), allows us to design non-trivial yet efficient generalization of convex
potential layers. Finally, the comprehensive set of experiments on image
classification shows that SLLs outperform previous approaches on certified
robust accuracy. Code is available at

					<dc:title>Asynchronous Modal FRP</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Over the past decade, a number of languages for functional reactive
programming (FRP) have been suggested, which use modal types to ensure
properties like causality, productivity and lack of space leaks. So far, almost
all of these languages have included a modal operator for delay on a global
clock. For some applications, however, the notion of global clock is unnatural
and leads to leaky abstractions as well as inefficient implementations. While
modal languages without a global clock have been proposed, no operational
properties have been proved about them, yet.
  This paper proposes Async RaTT, a new modal language for asynchronous FRP,
equipped with an operational semantics mapping complete programs to machines
that take asynchronous input signals and produce output signals. The main
novelty of Async RaTT is a new modality for asynchronous delay, allowing each
output channel to be associated at runtime with the set of input channels it
depends on, thus causing the machine to only compute new output when necessary.
We prove a series of operational properties including causality, productivity
and lack of space leaks. We also show that, although the set of input channels
associated with an output channel can change during execution, upper bounds on
these can be determined statically by the type system.

					<dc:description>  Change captioning is to describe the semantic change between a pair of
similar images in natural language. It is more challenging than general image
captioning, because it requires capturing fine-grained change information while
being immune to irrelevant viewpoint changes, and solving syntax ambiguity in
change descriptions. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood contrastive
transformer to improve the model's perceiving ability for various changes under
different scenes and cognition ability for complex syntax structure.
Concretely, we first design a neighboring feature aggregating to integrate
neighboring context into each feature, which helps quickly locate the
inconspicuous changes under the guidance of conspicuous referents. Then, we
devise a common feature distilling to compare two images at neighborhood level
and extract common properties from each image, so as to learn effective
contrastive information between them. Finally, we introduce the explicit
dependencies between words to calibrate the transformer decoder, which helps
better understand complex syntax structure during training. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets with different change
scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/tuyunbin/NCT.

in the HIPHIVE package and density functional theory as implemented in the Gpaw
code. Thermal conductivity of alkaline earth tellurides was determined, and the
narrower width between amplitudons and electrical modes exhibited supersonic
cooling and heat transportation, and our findings are in perfect agreement with
experimental research. When compared to the other binary crystals, BaTe appears
to offer the dual advantage of prolonged photon lifetime at normal temperature
as well as a speedier thermo-electric converter due to the tiny gap between

					<dc:description>  So far, quantum-limited power meters are not available in the microwave
domain, hindering measurement of photon number in itinerant quantum states. On
the one hand, single photon detectors accurately detect single photons, but
saturate as soon as two photons arrive simultaneously. On the other hand, more
linear watt meters, such as bolometers, are too noisy to accurately detect
single microwave photons. Linear amplifiers probe non-commuting observables of
a signal so that they must add noise and cannot be used to detect single
photons, either. Here we experimentally demonstrate a microwave
photon-multiplication scheme which combines the advantages of a single photon
detector and a power meter by multiplying the incoming photon number by an
integer factor. Our first experimental implementation achieves a n = 3-fold
multiplication with 0.69 efficiency in a 116 MHz bandwidth up to a input photon
rate of 400 MHz. It loses phase information but does not require any dead time
or time binning. We expect an optimised device cascading such multipliers to
achieve number-resolving measurement of itinerant photons with low dark count,
which would offer new possibilities in a wide range of quantum sensing and
quantum computing applications.

					<dc:description>  In the context of rapid discoveries by leaders in AI, governments must
consider how to design regulation that matches the increasing pace of new AI
capabilities. Regulatory Markets for AI is a proposal designed with
adaptability in mind. It involves governments setting outcome-based targets for
AI companies to achieve, which they can show by purchasing services from a
market of private regulators. We use an evolutionary game theory model to
explore the role governments can play in building a Regulatory Market for AI
systems that deters reckless behaviour. We warn that it is alarmingly easy to
stumble on incentives which would prevent Regulatory Markets from achieving
this goal. These 'Bounty Incentives' only reward private regulators for
catching unsafe behaviour. We argue that AI companies will likely learn to
tailor their behaviour to how much effort regulators invest, discouraging
regulators from innovating. Instead, we recommend that governments always
reward regulators, except when they find that those regulators failed to detect
unsafe behaviour that they should have. These 'Vigilant Incentives' could
encourage private regulators to find innovative ways to evaluate cutting-edge
AI systems.

					<dc:description>  Installation noise is a dominant source associated with aircraft jet engines.
Recent studies show that linear wavepacket models can be employed for
prediction of installation noise, which suggests that linear control strategies
can also be adopted for mitigation of it. We present here a simple model to
test different control approaches and highlight the potential restrictions on a
successful noise control in an actual jet. The model contains all the essential
elements for a realistic representation of the actual control problem: a
stochastic wavepacket is obtained via a linear Ginzburg-Landau model; the
effect of the wing trailing edge is accounted for by introducing a
semi-infinite half plane near the wavepacket; and the actuation is achieved by
placing a dipolar point source at the trailing edge, which models a
piezoelectric actuator. An optimal causal resolvent-based control method is
compared against the classical wave-cancellation method. The effect of the
causality constraint on the control performance is tested by placing the sensor
at different positions. We demonstrate that when the sensor is not positioned
sufficiently upstream of the trailing edge, which can be the case for the
actual control problem due to geometric restrictions, causality reduces the
control performance. We also show that this limitation can be moderated using
the optimal causal control together with modelling of the forcing.

					<dc:description>  Pre-trained model representations have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance in speech recognition, natural language processing, and other
applications. Speech models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and Hidden units BERT (HuBERT), have enabled generating
lexical and acoustic representations to benefit speech recognition
applications. We investigated the use of pre-trained model representations for
estimating dimensional emotions, such as activation, valence, and dominance,
from speech. We observed that while valence may rely heavily on lexical
representations, activation and dominance rely mostly on acoustic information.
In this work, we used multi-modal fusion representations from pre-trained
models to generate state-of-the-art speech emotion estimation, and we showed a
100% and 30% relative improvement in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)
on valence estimation compared to standard acoustic and lexical baselines.
Finally, we investigated the robustness of pre-trained model representations
against noise and reverberation degradation and noticed that lexical and
acoustic representations are impacted differently. We discovered that lexical
representations are more robust to distortions compared to acoustic
representations, and demonstrated that knowledge distillation from a
multi-modal model helps to improve the noise-robustness of acoustic-based
models.

					<dc:description>  Searching for objects is a fundamental skill for robots. As such, we expect
object search to eventually become an off-the-shelf capability for robots,
similar to e.g., object detection and SLAM. In contrast, however, no system for
3D object search exists that generalizes across real robots and environments.
In this paper, building upon a recent theoretical framework that exploited the
octree structure for representing belief in 3D, we present GenMOS (Generalized
Multi-Object Search), the first general-purpose system for multi-object search
(MOS) in a 3D region that is robot-independent and environment-agnostic. GenMOS
takes as input point cloud observations of the local region, object detection
results, and localization of the robot's view pose, and outputs a 6D viewpoint
to move to through online planning. In particular, GenMOS uses point cloud
observations in three ways: (1) to simulate occlusion; (2) to inform occupancy
and initialize octree belief; and (3) to sample a belief-dependent graph of
view positions that avoid obstacles. We evaluate our system both in simulation
and on two real robot platforms. Our system enables, for example, a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot to find a toy cat hidden underneath a couch in under one
minute. We further integrate 3D local search with 2D global search to handle
larger areas, demonstrating the resulting system in a 25m$^2$ lobby area.

					<dc:title>Metamorphic Testing for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Detection</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Li, Jiahao</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Despite the rapid growth of smart contracts, they are suffering numerous
security vulnerabilities due to the absence of reliable development and
testing. In this article, we apply the metamorphic testing technique to detect
smart contract vulnerabilities. Based on the anomalies we observed in
vulnerable smart contracts, we define five metamorphic relations to detect
abnormal gas consumption and account interaction inconsistency of the target
smart contract. Through dynamically executing transactions and checking the
final violation of metamorphic relations, we determine whether a smart contract
is vulnerable. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark of 67 manually annotated
smart contracts. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a
higher detection rate (TPR, true positive rate) with a lower misreport rate
(FDR, false discovery rate) than the other three state-of-the-art tools. These
results further suggest that metamorphic testing is a promising method for
detecting smart contract vulnerabilities.

					<dc:description>  We report on the single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered
Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over large areas on Au
nanolayers, that can be used for plasmonic sensing. A comprehensive study on
LIPSS formation on 32 nm Au film upon double, 170 fs pulse irradiation,
unveiled the key importance of interpulse delay as the determining factor
behind the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirmed that highly
ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation. In
particular, the impact of pulse overlap, fluence and interpulse delay reveals
that homogeneous LIPSS formation is optimized within a specific interpulse
delay range. At the same time, examination of nanoscale features of the
structures points out a significant differentiation of the LIPSS formation
characteristics between single and double pulse irradiation. Theoretical
investigation complements experimental results providing insights on the
structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements validate that such
structures exhibit characteristic plasmon resonances that can be exploited for
sensing applications. The presented data demonstrate a novel functionality of
LIPSS, while providing strong evidence of the capabilities of femtosecond
double pulse irradiation as a valuable and low-cost tool for the precise
fabrication of highly ordered structures.

					<dc:description>  A fundamental challenge in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is the
design of robust PIML methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting tasks.
These OOD tasks require learning-to-learn from observations of the same (ODE)
dynamical system with different unknown ODE parameters, and demand accurate
forecasts even under out-of-support initial conditions and out-of-support ODE
parameters. In this work we propose a solution for such tasks, which we define
as a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery (including
invariant risk minimization). Using three different OOD tasks, we empirically
observe that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art PIML and deep learning methods.

					<dc:title>Decentralized Caching under Nonuniform File Popularity and Size:
  Memory-Rate Tradeoff Characterization</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Deng, Yong</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Dong, Min</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  This paper aims to characterize the memory-rate tradeoff for decentralized
caching under nonuniform file popularity and size. We consider a recently
proposed decentralized modified coded caching scheme (D-MCCS) and formulate the
cache placement optimization problem to minimize the average rate for the
D-MCCS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first
propose a successive Geometric Programming (GP) approximation algorithm, which
guarantees convergence to a stationary point but has high computational
complexity. Next, we develop a low-complexity file-group-based approach, where
we propose a popularity-first and size-aware (PF-SA) cache placement strategy
to partition files into two groups, taking into account the nonuniformity in
file popularity and size. Both algorithms do not require the knowledge of
active users beforehand for cache placement. Numerical results show that they
perform very closely to each other. We further develop a lower bound for
decentralized caching under nonuniform file popularity and size as a non-convex
optimization problem and solved it using a similar successive GP approximation
algorithm. We show that the D-MCCS with the optimized cache placement attains
this lower bound when no more than two active users request files at a time.
The same is true for files with uniform size but nonuniform popularity and the
optimal cache placement being symmetric among files. In these cases, the
optimized DMCCS characterizes the exact memory-rate tradeoff for decentralized
caching. For general cases, our numerical results show that the average rate
achieved by the optimized D-MCCS is very close to the lower bound.

					<dc:description>  Rodents communicate through ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). These calls are
of interest because they provide insight into the development and function of
vocal communication, and may prove to be useful as a biomarker for dysfunction
in models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Rodent USVs can be categorised into
different components and while manual classification is time consuming,
advances in neural computing have allowed for fast and accurate identification
and classification. Here, we adapt a convolutional neural network (CNN),
VocalMat, created for analysing mice USVs, for use with rats. We codify a
modified schema, adapted from that previously proposed by Wright et al. (2010),
for classification, and compare the performance of our adaptation of VocalMat
with a benchmark CNN, DeepSqueak. Additionally, we test the effect of inserting
synthetic USVs into the training data of our classification network in order to
reduce the workload involved in generating a training set. Our results show
that the modified VocalMat outperformed the benchmark software on measures of
both call identification, and classification. Additionally, we found that the
augmentation of training data with synthetic images resulted in a marked
improvement in the accuracy of VocalMat when it was subsequently used to
analyse novel data. The resulting accuracy on the modified Wright
categorizations was sufficiently high to allow for the application of this
software in rat USV classification in laboratory conditions. Our findings also
show that inserting synthetic USV calls into the training set leads to
improvements in accuracy with little extra time-cost.

high-energy photon-proton ($\gamma p$) $\rightarrow {\rm meson + proton}$
process in electron-proton ($ep$) collisions performed at CEBAF, NINA, CEA,
SLAC, DESY, and WLS are analyzed. The Monte Carlo calculations are used in the
analysis of the squared momentum transfer spectra, where the transfer undergoes
from the incident $\gamma$ to emitted meson or equivalently from the target
proton to emitted proton. In the calculations, the Erlang distribution and
Tsallis-Levy function are used to describe the transverse momentum spectra of
emitted particles. Our results show that the average transverse momentum
($\langle p_T\rangle$), the initial-state temperature ($T_i$), and the
final-state temperature ($T_0$) roughly decrease from lower center-of-mass
energy ($W$) to higher one, and at several special $W$, this tendency is
broken.

					<dc:description>  Ensembling is a successful technique to improve the performance of machine
learning (ML) models.
  Conf-Ensemble is an adaptation to Boosting to create ensembles based on model
confidence instead of model errors to better classify difficult edge-cases. The
key idea is to create successive model experts for samples that were difficult
(not necessarily incorrectly classified) by the preceding model. This technique
has been shown to provide better results than boosting in binary-classification
with a small feature space (~80 features).
  In this paper, we evaluate the Conf-Ensemble approach in the much more
complex task of image classification with the ImageNet dataset (224x224x3
features with 1000 classes). Image classification is an important benchmark for
AI-based perception and thus it helps to assess if this method can be used in
safety-critical applications using ML ensembles.
  Our experiments indicate that in a complex multi-label classification task,
the expected benefit of specialization on complex input samples cannot be
achieved with a small sample set, i.e., a good classifier seems to rely on very
complex feature analysis that cannot be well trained on just a limited subset
of &quot;difficult samples&quot;.
  We propose an improvement to Conf-Ensemble to increase the number of samples
fed to successive ensemble members, and a three-member Conf-Ensemble using this
improvement was able to surpass a single model in accuracy, although the amount
is not significant. Our findings shed light on the limits of the approach and
the non-triviality of harnessing big data.

					<dc:description>  ChatGPT has shown the potential of emerging general artificial intelligence
capabilities, as it has demonstrated competent performance across many natural
language processing tasks. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of
ChatGPT to perform text classification on three affective computing problems,
namely, big-five personality prediction, sentiment analysis, and suicide
tendency detection. We utilise three baselines, a robust language model
(RoBERTa-base), a legacy word model with pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec), and
a simple bag-of-words baseline (BoW). Results show that the RoBERTa trained for
a specific downstream task generally has a superior performance. On the other
hand, ChatGPT provides decent results, and is relatively comparable to the
Word2Vec and BoW baselines. ChatGPT further shows robustness against noisy
data, where Word2Vec models achieve worse results due to noise. Results
indicate that ChatGPT is a good generalist model that is capable of achieving
good results across various problems without any specialised training, however,
it is not as good as a specialised model for a downstream task.

					<dc:description>  Under stringent model type and variable distribution assumptions,
differentiable score-based causal discovery methods learn a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) from observational data by evaluating candidate graphs over an
average score function. Despite great success in low-dimensional linear
systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploit
easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still,
inherent mostly in these methods the common homogeneity assumption can be
easily violated, due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the
real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions
vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost
causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for
the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the weights tailor
quantitatively to the importance degree of each sample. Intuitively, we
leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to \wx{alternately train a standard
DAG learner and reweight samples -- that is, upweight the samples the learner
fails to fit and downweight the samples that the learner easily extracts the
spurious information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore.
We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance.
Furthermore, we visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of
spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform the
theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight
adaptive properties of ReScore in linear systems. Our codes are available at
https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore.

					<dc:description>  In many instances, the dynamical richness and complexity observed in natural
phenomena can be related to stochastic drives influencing their temporal
evolution. For example, random noise allied to spatial asymmetries may induce
stabilization of otherwise diverging trajectories in a nonlinear dynamics.
However, how exactly this type of phenomenology takes place in actual processes
is usually very difficulty to identify. Here we unveil few trends leading to
dynamical stabilization and diversity by introducing Gaussian noise to a class
of exactly solvable non-linear deterministic models displaying space-dependent
drifts. For the resulting nonlinear Langevin equations, the associated
Fokker-Planck equations can be solved through the similarity method or the
Fourier transform technique. By comparing the cases with and without noise, we
discuss the changes in the system's dynamical behavior. Simple cases of drift
and diffusion coefficients are explicitly analyzed and comparisons with some
other models in the literature are made. Our study illustrates the behavioral
richness originated from spatially heterogeneous dynamical systems under the
influence of white noise.

					<dc:description>  The concepts of train track was introduced by W. P. Thurston to study the
measured foliations/laminations and the pseudo-Anosov mapping classes on a
surface. In this paper, we translate some concepts of train tracks into the
language of cluster algebras using the Goncharov--Shen's potential function
[GS15]. Through this translation, we prove the sign stability [IK21] of the
general pseudo-Anosov mapping classes.

					<dc:description>  The relationship between symmetry fields and first integrals of
divergence-free vector fields is explored in three dimensions in light of its
relevance to plasma physics and magnetic confinement fusion. A Noether-type
Theorem is known: for each such symmetry, there corresponds a conserved
quantity. The extent to which the converse is true is investigated. In doing
so, a reformulation of this Noether-type Theorem is found for which the
converse holds on what is called the toroidal region. Some consequences of the
methods presented are quick proofs of the existence of flux coordinates for
magnetic fields in high generality; without needing to assume a symmetry such
as in the cases of magneto-hydrostatics (MHS) or quasi-symmetry.

					<dc:description>  Symbolic Regression is the study of algorithms that automate the search for
analytic expressions that fit data. While recent advances in deep learning have
generated renewed interest in such approaches, efforts have not been focused on
physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units
associated with our data. Here we present $\Phi$-SO, a Physical Symbolic
Optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from
physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units
constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions
where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not
only in eliminating physically impossible solutions, but because it restricts
enormously the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving
performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be
useful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a
physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to
noisy data. We showcase our machinery on a panel of examples from astrophysics.

					<dc:description>  Magnetic reconnection in naturally occurring and laboratory settings often
begins locally and elongates, or spreads, in the direction perpendicular to the
plane of reconnection. Previous work has largely focused on current sheets with
a uniform thickness, for which the predicted spreading speed for anti-parallel
reconnection is the local speed of the current carriers. We derive a scaling
theory of three-dimensional (3D) spreading of collisionless anti-parallel
reconnection in a current sheet with its thickness varying in the out-of-plane
direction, both for spreading from a thinner to thicker region and a thicker to
thinner region. We derive an expression for calculating the time it takes for
spreading to occur for a current sheet with a given profile of its thickness. A
key result is that when reconnection spreads from a thinner to a thicker
region, the spreading speed in the thicker region is slower than both the
Alfv\'en speed and the speed of the local current carriers by a factor of the
ratio of thin to thick current sheet thicknesses. This is important because
magnetospheric and solar observations have previously measured the spreading
speed to be slower than previously predicted, so the present mechanism might
explain this feature. We confirm the theory via a parametric study using 3D
two-fluid numerical simulations. We use the prediction to calculate the time
scale for reconnection spreading in Earth's magnetotail during geomagnetic
activity. The results are also potentially important for understanding
reconnection spreading in solar flares and the dayside magnetopause of Earth
and other planets.

					<dc:description>  We consider a principal problem, that of the possible dominating role of
self-consistent gravitational interaction in the formation of cosmic
structures: voids and their walls in the local Universe. It is in the context
of the Hubble tension as a possible indication of the difference in the
descriptions of the late (local) and early (global) Universe. The kinetic
Vlasov treatment enables us to consider the evolution of gravitating structures
where the fundamental role has the modified gravitational potential with a
cosmological constant, leading to the prediction of a local flow with a Hubble
parameter that is nonidentical to that of the global Hubble flow. The Poisson
equation for a potential with an additional repulsive term, including an
integral equation formulation, is analyzed, and we predict the appearance of
multiply connected two-dimensional gravitating structures and voids in the
local Universe. The obvious consequence of the developed mechanism is that the
cosmological constant poses a natural scaling for the voids, along with the
physical parameters of their local environment, which can be traced in
observational surveys.

					<dc:description>  Progress in fields of machine learning and adversarial planning has benefited
significantly from benchmark domains, from checkers and the classic UCI data
sets to Go and Diplomacy. In sequential decision-making, agent evaluation has
largely been restricted to few interactions against experts, with the aim to
reach some desired level of performance (e.g. beating a human professional
player). We propose a benchmark for multiagent learning based on repeated play
of the simple game Rock, Paper, Scissors along with a population of forty-three
tournament entries, some of which are intentionally sub-optimal. We describe
metrics to measure the quality of agents based both on average returns and
exploitability. We then show that several RL, online learning, and language
model approaches can learn good counter-strategies and generalize well, but
ultimately lose to the top-performing bots, creating an opportunity for
research in multiagent learning.

					<dc:description>  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) communications offer various advantages over
terrestrial communications due to mobility and high Probability of Line of
Sight ($P_{LoS}$). Estimating the $P_{LoS}$ from UAV to ground users at a
certain distance or inclination angle in different urban environments is
essential for designing various applications. The existing $P_{LoS}$ models
have limited applicability or cannot be generalized to any environment, as they
are derived for a specific subset of possible 3D city geometries. Therefore, we
present a three-dimensional (3D) city simulator to estimate $P_{LoS}$ from UAV
to ground users for arbitrary UAV height, location, user height, and distance.
The simulator results can be generalized using built-up parameters for any city
environment. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different UAV locations on
$P_{LoS}$ for street coverage. Lastly, we develop a lightweight geometry-based
simulator using random user locations to validate the 3D simulator results.

					<dc:subject>Nonlinear Sciences - Chaotic Dynamics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Many systems in physics, chemistry and biology exhibit oscillations with a
pronounced random component. Such stochastic oscillations can emerge via
different mechanisms, for example linear dynamics of a stable focus with
fluctuations, limit-cycle systems perturbed by noise, or excitable systems in
which random inputs lead to a train of pulses. Despite their diverse origins,
the phenomenology of random oscillations can be strikingly similar. Here we
introduce a nonlinear transformation of stochastic oscillators to a new
complex-valued function $Q^*_1(\textbf{x})$ that greatly simplifies and unifies
the mathematical description of the oscillator's spontaneous activity, its
response to an external time-dependent perturbation, and the correlation
statistics of different oscillators that are weakly coupled. The function
$Q^*_1(\textbf{x})$ is the eigenfunction of the Kolmogorov backward operator
with the least negative (but non-vanishing) eigenvalue
$\lambda_1=\mu_1+i\omega_1$. The resulting power spectrum of the complex-valued
function is exactly given by a Lorentz spectrum with peak frequency $\omega_1$
and half-width $\mu_1$; its susceptibility with respect to a weak external
forcing is given by a simple one-pole filter, centered around $\omega_1$; and
the cross-spectrum between two coupled oscillators can be easily expressed by a
combination of the spontaneous power spectra of the uncoupled systems and their
susceptibilities. Our approach makes qualitatively different stochastic
oscillators comparable, provides simple characteristics for the coherence of
the random oscillation, and gives a framework for the description of weakly
coupled oscillators.

					<dc:description>  We propose a conceptual perspective on prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) that distinguishes between (1) diegetic prompts (part of the narrative,
e.g. &quot;Once upon a time, I saw a fox...&quot;), and (2) non-diegetic prompts
(external, e.g. &quot;Write about the adventures of the fox.&quot;). With this lens, we
study how 129 crowd workers on Prolific write short texts with different user
interfaces (1 vs 3 suggestions, with/out non-diegetic prompts; implemented with
GPT-3): When the interface offered multiple suggestions and provided an option
for non-diegetic prompting, participants preferred choosing from multiple
suggestions over controlling them via non-diegetic prompts. When participants
provided non-diegetic prompts it was to ask for inspiration, topics or facts.
Single suggestions in particular were guided both with diegetic and
non-diegetic information. This work informs human-AI interaction with
generative models by revealing that (1) writing non-diegetic prompts requires
effort, (2) people combine diegetic and non-diegetic prompting, and (3) they
use their draft (i.e. diegetic information) and suggestion timing to
strategically guide LLMs.

					<dc:description>  Vectorial Genetic Programming (Vec-GP) extends GP by allowing vectors as
input features along regular, scalar features, using them by applying
arithmetic operations component-wise or aggregating vectors into scalars by
some aggregation function. Vec-GP also allows aggregating vectors only over a
limited segment of the vector instead of the whole vector, which offers great
potential but also introduces new parameters that GP has to optimize. This
paper formalizes an optimization problem to analyze different strategies for
optimizing a window for aggregation functions. Different strategies are
presented, included random and guided sampling, where the latter leverages
information from an approximated gradient. Those strategies can be applied as a
simple optimization algorithm, which itself ca be applied inside a specialized
mutation operator within GP. The presented results indicate, that the different
random sampling strategies do not impact the overall algorithm performance
significantly, and that the guided strategies suffer from becoming stuck in
local optima. However, results also indicate, that there is still potential in
discovering more efficient algorithms that could outperform the presented
strategies.

					<dc:description>  A Lee-Yang polynomial $ p(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}) $ is a polynomial that has no
zeros in the polydisc $ \D^{n} $ and its inverse $
(\C\setminus\overline{\D})^{n} $. We show that any real-rooted exponential
polynomial of the form $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^s c_j e^{\lambda_j x}$ can be written
as the restriction of a Lee-Yang polynomial to a positive line in the torus.
Together with previous work by Olevskii and Ulanovskii, this implies that the
Kurasov-Sarnak construction of $ \N $-valued Fourier quasicrystals from stable
polynomials comprises every possible $ \N $-valued Fourier quasicrystal.

					<dc:description>  Human body trajectories are a salient cue to identify actions in the video.
Such body trajectories are mainly conveyed by hands and face across consecutive
frames in sign language. However, current methods in continuous sign language
recognition (CSLR) usually process frames independently, thus failing to
capture cross-frame trajectories to effectively identify a sign. To handle this
limitation, we propose correlation network (CorrNet) to explicitly capture and
leverage body trajectories across frames to identify signs. In specific, a
correlation module is first proposed to dynamically compute correlation maps
between the current frame and adjacent frames to identify trajectories of all
spatial patches. An identification module is then presented to dynamically
emphasize the body trajectories within these correlation maps. As a result, the
generated features are able to gain an overview of local temporal movements to
identify a sign. Thanks to its special attention on body trajectories, CorrNet
achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets, i.e.,
PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily, and CSL. A comprehensive comparison with
previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies the effectiveness of
CorrNet. Visualizations demonstrate the effects of CorrNet on emphasizing human
body trajectories across adjacent frames.

					<dc:title>Linear dynamics of an operator associated to the Collatz map</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>B&#xe9;hani, Vincent</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Functional Analysis</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we study the dynamics of an operator $\mathcal T$ naturally
associated to the so-called Collatz map, which maps an integer $n \geq 0$ to $n
/ 2$ if $n$ is even and $3n + 1$ if $n$ is odd. This operator $\mathcal T$ is
defined on certain weighted Bergman spaces $\mathcal B ^ 2 _ \omega$ of
analytic functions on the unit disk. Building on previous work of Neklyudov, we
show that $\mathcal T$ is hypercyclic on $\mathcal B ^ 2 _ \omega$,
independently of whether the Collatz Conjecture holds true or not. Under some
assumptions on the weight $\omega$, we show that $\mathcal T$ is actually
ergodic with respect to a Gaussian measure with full support, and thus
frequently hypercyclic and chaotic.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  DMP have been extensively applied in various robotic tasks thanks to their
generalization and robustness properties. However, the successful execution of
a given task may necessitate the use of different motion patterns that take
into account not only the initial and target position but also features
relating to the overall structure and layout of the scene. To make DMP
applicable in wider range of tasks and further automate their use, we design in
this work a framework combining deep residual networks with DMP, that can
encapsulate different motion patterns of a planar task, provided through human
demonstrations on the RGB image plane. We can then automatically infer from new
raw RGB visual input the appropriate DMP parameters, i.e. the weights that
determine the motion pattern and the initial/target positions. We
experimentally validate our method in the task of unveiling the stem of a
grape-bunch from occluding leaves using on a mock-up vine setup and compare it
to another SoA method for inferring DMP from images.

					<dc:description>  The smart textile and wearables sector is looking towards advancing
technologies to meet both industry, consumer and new emerging innovative
textile application demands, within a fast paced textile industry. In parallel
inspiration based on the biological neural workings of the human brain is
driving the next generation of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence
inspired hardware (neuromorphic computing) and software modules mimicking the
processing capabilities and properties of neural networks and the human nervous
system are taking shape. The textile sector needs to actively look at such
emerging and new technologies taking inspiration from their workings and
processing methods in order to stimulate new and innovative embedded
intelligence advancements in the etextile world. This emerging next generation
of Artificial intelligence(AI) is rapidly gaining interest across varying
industries (textile, medical, automotive, aerospace, military). How such
properties can inspire and drive advancements within the etextiles sector needs
to be considered. This paper will provide an insight into current
nanotechnology and artificial intelligence advancements in the etextiles domain
before focusing specifically on the future vision and direction around the
potential application of neuromorphic computing and spiking neural network
inspired AI technologies within the textile sector. We investigate the core
architectural elements of artificial neural networks, neuromorphic computing
and how such neuroscience inspired technologies could impact and inspire change
and new research developments within the e-textile sector.

					<dc:description>  In this work we want to study quasielastic (p, n) exchange reactions using a
semi-microscopic optical model derived in a previous work [1] based on a
nuclear matter approach where the real and imaginary parts are given by the
first and second order terms, respectively, of the mass operator obtained by a
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculation using a G-matrix built up with an effective
Gogny interaction. The study of these quasielastic reactions is performed
within a Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) to evaluate the wave
functions in the entrance and exit channels, which in turn are used to compute
the transition matrix elements. This model, which is free of adjustable
parameters, provide a reasonable good agreement with the considered
experimental data, namely differential cross sections, analyzing powers and
total cross sections, of different reactions spanned along the periodic table
at several energies.

					<dc:description>  The field of robotic Flexible Endoscopes (FEs) has progressed significantly,
offering a promising solution to reduce patient discomfort. However, the
limited autonomy of most robotic FEs results in non-intuitive and challenging
manoeuvres, constraining their application in clinical settings. While previous
studies have employed lumen tracking for autonomous navigation, they fail to
adapt to the presence of obstructions and sharp turns when the endoscope faces
the colon wall. In this work, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL)-based navigation strategy that eliminates the need for lumen tracking.
However, the use of DRL methods poses safety risks as they do not account for
potential hazards associated with the actions taken. To ensure safety, we
exploit a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method to restrict the
policy in a predefined safety regime. Moreover, we present a model selection
strategy that utilises Formal Verification (FV) to choose a policy that is
entirely safe before deployment. We validate our approach in a virtual
colonoscopy environment and report that out of the 300 trained policies, we
could identify three policies that are entirely safe. Our work demonstrates
that CRL, combined with model selection through FV, can improve the robustness
and safety of robotic behaviour in surgical applications.

					<dc:description>  The use of autonomous robots for delivery of goods to customers is an
exciting new way to provide a reliable and sustainable service. However, in the
real world, autonomous robots still require human supervision for safety
reasons. We tackle the realworld problem of optimizing autonomous robot timings
to maximize deliveries, while ensuring that there are never too many robots
running simultaneously so that they can be monitored safely. We assess the use
of a recent hybrid machine-learningoptimization approach COIL (constrained
optimization in learned latent space) and compare it with a baseline genetic
algorithm for the purposes of exploring variations of this problem. We also
investigate new methods for improving the speed and efficiency of COIL. We show
that only COIL can find valid solutions where appropriate numbers of robots run
simultaneously for all problem variations tested. We also show that when COIL
has learned its latent representation, it can optimize 10% faster than the GA,
making it a good choice for daily re-optimization of robots where delivery
requests for each day are allocated to robots while maintaining safe numbers of
robots running at once.

					<dc:description>  Super-resolution is the process of obtaining a high-resolution image from one
or more low-resolution images. Single image super-resolution (SISR) and
multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) methods have been evolved almost
independently for years. A neglected study in this field is the theoretical
analysis of finding the optimum combination of SISR and MFSR. To fill this gap,
we propose a novel theoretical analysis based on the iterative shrinkage and
thresholding algorithm. We implement and compare several approaches for
combining SISR and MFSR, and simulation results support the finding of our
theoretical analysis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

					<dc:description>  We focus on the problem of producing new modular tensor categories from Hopf
algebras. To do this, we first give a general method to construct factorizable
Hopf algebras. Then we apply the method to construct two families of ribbon
factorizable Hopf algebras which are not quantum groups or Drinfel'd double.
One family are point Hopf algebras which give non-semisimple modular tensor
categories, while the other family are C^*-Hopf algebras which give new unitary
modular tensor categories. Lastly, we determine the fusion rings of these
unitary modular tensor categories.

					<dc:description>  This paper presents our methodology to simulate the behavior of the DeLend
Platform. Such simulations are important to verify if the system is able to
connect the different sets of agents linked to the platform in a functional
manner. They also provide inputs to guide the choices of operational
parameters, such as the platform spread, and strategies by DeLend, since they
estimate how the key variables of interest respond to different policies. We
discuss the methodology and provide examples meant to clarify the approach and
to how we intend to use the tool in practice -- they should not be interpreted
as representative of real life scenarios.

					<dc:title>Dynamics of twisted electron impact ionization of CH4 and NH3 molecule</dc:title>

					<dc:description>  Electron vortex beams (EVB, also known as twisted electron beams) possess an
intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) with respect to their propagation
direction. This intrinsic OAM represents a new degree of freedom that provides
new insights into investigating the dynamics of electron impact ionization. In
this communication, we present, in the first-Born approximation (FBA), the
angular profiles of the triple differential cross-section (TDCS) for the (e,
2e) process on CH4 and NH3 molecular targets in the coplanar asymmetric
geometry. We compare the TDCS of the EVB for different values of OAM number m
with that of the plane wave. For a more realistic scenario, we investigate the
average TDCS for macroscopic targets to explore the influence of the opening
angle {\theta}p of the twisted electron beam on the TDCS. In addition, we also
present the TDCS for the coherent superposition of two EVBs. The results
demonstrate that the twisted (e, 2e) process retrieves the p-type character of
the molecular orbitals, which is absent in the plane wave TDCS for the given
kinematics. The results for the coherent superposition of two Bessel beams show
the sensitivity of TDCS towards the OAM number m.

					<dc:description>  Antiferromagnets hosting real-space topological spin textures are promising
platforms to model fundamental ultrafast phenomena and explore spintronics.
However, to date, they have only been fabricated epitaxially on specific
symmetry-matched crystalline substrates, to preserve their intrinsic
magneto-crystalline order. This curtails their integration with dissimilar
supports, markedly restricting the scope of fundamental and applied
investigations. Here, we circumvent this limitation by designing detachable
crystalline antiferromagnetic nanomembranes of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, that
can be transferred onto other desirable supports after growth. We develop
transmission-based antiferromagnetic vector-mapping to show that these
nanomembranes harbour rich topological phenomenology at room temperature.
Moreover, we exploit their extreme flexibility to demonstrate three-dimensional
reconfiguration of antiferromagnetic properties, driven locally via
flexure-induced strains. This allows us to spatially design antiferromagnetic
states outside their typical thermal stability window. Integration of such
freestanding antiferromagnetic layers with flat or curved nanostructures could
enable spin texture designs tailored by magnetoelastic-/geometric-effects in
the quasi-static and dynamical regimes, opening new explorations into
curvilinear antiferromagnetism and unconventional computing.

					<dc:description>  This work establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the
initial-value problem for the geometric transport equation $$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}T_t+\mathcal{L}_b T_t=0 $$ in the class of
$k$-dimensional integral or normal currents $T_t$ ($t$ being the time variable)
under the natural assumption of Lipschitz regularity of the driving vector
field $b$. Our argument relies crucially on the notion of decomposability
bundle introduced recently by Alberti and Marchese. In the particular case of
$0$-currents, this also yields a new proof of the uniqueness for the continuity
equation in the class of signed measures.

					<dc:description>  Understanding oxidation mechanisms of layered semiconducting transition-metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) is important not only for controlling native oxide
formation but also for synthesis of oxide and oxysulfide products. Here,
reactive molecular dynamics simulations show that oxygen partial pressure
controls not only the ZrS2 oxidation rate but also the oxide morphology and
quality. We find a transition from layer-by-layer oxidation to
amorphous-oxide-mediated continuous oxidation as the oxidation progresses,
where different pressures selectively expose different oxidation stages within
a given time window. While the kinetics of the fast continuous oxidation stage
is well described by the conventional Deal-Grove model, the layer-by-layer
oxidation stage is dictated by reactive bond-switching mechanisms. This work
provides atomistic details and a potential foundation for rational
pressure-controlled oxidation of broad TMDC materials.

					<dc:description>  Live and pre-recorded video tutorials are an effective means for teaching
physical skills such as cooking or prototyping electronics. A dedicated
cameraperson following an instructor's activities can improve production
quality. However, instructors who do not have access to a cameraperson's help
often have to work within the constraints of static cameras. We present
Stargazer, a novel approach for assisting with tutorial content creation with a
camera robot that autonomously tracks regions of interest based on instructor
actions to capture dynamic shots. Instructors can adjust the camera behaviors
of Stargazer with subtle cues, including gestures and speech, allowing them to
fluidly integrate camera control commands into instructional activities. Our
user study with six instructors, each teaching a distinct skill, showed that
participants could create dynamic tutorial videos with a diverse range of
subjects, camera framing, and camera angle combinations using Stargazer.

					<dc:subject>High Energy Physics - Experiment</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  The T2K experiment presents new measurements of neutrino oscillation
parameters using $19.7(16.3)\times10^{20}$ protons on target (POT) in
(anti-)neutrino mode at the far detector (FD). Compared to the previous
analysis, an additional $4.7\times10^{20}$ POT neutrino data was collected at
the FD. Significant improvements were made to the analysis methodology, with
the near-detector analysis introducing new selections and using more than
double the data. Additionally, this is the first T2K oscillation analysis to
use NA61/SHINE data on a replica of the T2K target to tune the neutrino flux
model, and the neutrino interaction model was improved to include new nuclear
effects and calculations. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses are presented,
including results on $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ and the impact of priors on the
$\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ measurement. Both analyses prefer the normal mass ordering
and upper octant of $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ with a nearly maximally CP-violating
phase. Assuming the normal ordering and using the constraint on
$\sin^2\theta_{13}$ from reactors, $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.561^{+0.021}_{-0.032}$
using Feldman--Cousins corrected intervals, and
$\Delta{}m^2_{32}=2.494_{-0.058}^{+0.041}\times10^{-3}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ using
constant $\Delta\chi^{2}$ intervals. The CP-violating phase is constrained to
$\delta_\mathrm{CP}=-1.97_{-0.70}^{+0.97}$ using Feldman--Cousins corrected
intervals, and $\delta_\mathrm{CP}=0,\pi$ is excluded at more than 90\%
confidence level. A Jarlskog invariant of zero is excluded at more than
$2\sigma$ credible level using a flat prior in $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$, and just
below $2\sigma$ using a flat prior in $\sin\delta_\mathrm{CP}$. When the
external constraint on $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ is removed,
$\sin^2\theta_{13}=28.0^{+2.8}_{-6.5}\times10^{-3}$, in agreement with
measurements from reactor experiments. These results are consistent with
previous T2K analyses.

					<dc:description>  In this thesis we study the preconditioning of square, non-symmetric and real
Toeplitz systems. We prove theoretical results, which constitute sufficient
conditions for the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners and the fast
convergence to the solution of the system, by the Preconditioned Generalized
Minimal Residual method (PGMRES) as well as by the Preconditioned Conjugate
Gradient method applied to the system of Normal Equations (PCGN). As
introduction, in the first chapter, we give the basic definitions and
theorems/lemmas that we use to prove the theoretical results of the thesis.
These are dealing with the clustering of the eigenvalues, as well as of the
singular values, which is a criterion for the efficiency of the preconditioner.
In the second chapter we construct a band Toeplitz preconditioner for
wellconditioned, as well as for ill-conditioned systems. The preconditioning
technique is based on the elimination of the roots of the generating function
(if there exist), by a trigonometric polynomial, and on a further
approximation. The clustering of the eigenvalues and the singular values of the
preconditioned system has been proven. In the next chapter we construct a
circulant preconditioner dealing with well-conditioned Toeplitz systems and a
band-times-circulant preconditioner for ill-conditioned ones. We prove
analogous theoretical results and we give a comparison with the preconditioner
proposed previously at the numerical results of the last section. In the fourth
and last chapter of the thesis we study Toeplitz systems, having an unknown
generating function. We adapt the preconditioners constructed at the previous
chapters. After estimating the generating function, its roots and the
multiplicities of them, we construct the corresponding preconditioners.

					<dc:description>  A graph is called odd (respectively, even) if every vertex has odd
(respectively, even) degree. Gallai proved that every graph can be partitioned
into two even induced subgraphs, or into an odd and an even induced subgraph.
We refer to a partition into odd subgraphs as an odd colouring of G. Scott
[Graphs and Combinatorics, 2001] proved that a graph admits an odd colouring if
and only if it has an even number of vertices. We say that a graph G is k-odd
colourable if it can be partitioned into at most k odd induced subgraphs. We
initiate the systematic study of odd colouring and odd chromatic number of
graph classes. In particular, we consider for a number of classes whether they
have bounded odd chromatic number. Our main results are that interval graphs,
graphs of bounded modular-width and graphs of bounded maximum degree all have
bounded odd chromatic number.

					<dc:description>  Safe Reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims at learning optimal policies while
staying safe. A popular solution to Safe RL is shielding, which uses a logical
safety specification to prevent an RL agent from taking unsafe actions.
However, traditional shielding techniques are difficult to integrate with
continuous, end-to-end deep RL methods. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic
Logic Policy Gradient (PLPG). PLPG is a model-based Safe RL technique that uses
probabilistic logic programming to model logical safety constraints as
differentiable functions. Therefore, PLPG can be seamlessly applied to any
policy gradient algorithm while still providing the same convergence
guarantees. In our experiments, we show that PLPG learns safer and more
rewarding policies compared to other state-of-the-art shielding techniques.

					<dc:description>  Quantum neural networks represent a new machine learning paradigm that has
recently attracted much attention due to its potential promise. Under certain
conditions, these models approximate the distribution of their dataset with a
truncated Fourier series. The trigonometric nature of this fit could result in
angle-embedded quantum neural networks struggling to fit the non-harmonic
features in a given dataset. Moreover, the interpretability of neural networks
remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a new, interpretable class of
hybrid quantum neural networks that pass the inputs of the dataset in parallel
to 1) a classical multi-layered perceptron and 2) a variational quantum
circuit, and then the outputs of the two are linearly combined. We observe that
the quantum neural network creates a smooth sinusoidal foundation base on the
training set, and then the classical perceptrons fill the non-harmonic gaps in
the landscape. We demonstrate this claim on two synthetic datasets sampled from
periodic distributions with added protrusions as noise. The training results
indicate that the parallel hybrid network architecture could improve the
solution optimality on periodic datasets with additional noise.

					<dc:description>  In this work we define the Ribaucour-type surfaces (in short, RT-surfaces).
These surfaces satisfy a relationship similar to the Ribaucour surfaces that
are related to the \'Elie Cartan problem. This class furnishes what seems to be
the first examples of pairs of noncongruent surfaces in Euclidean space such
that, under a diffeomorphism, lines of curvatures are preserved and principal
curvatures are switched. We show that every compact and connected RT-surface is
a sphere with center at the origin. We obtain present a Weierstrass type
representation for RT-surfaces with prescribed Gauss map which depends on two
holomorphic functions. We give explicit examples of RT-surfaces. Also, we use
this representation to classify the RT-surfaces of rotation.

					<dc:description>  LongEval-Retrieval is a Web document retrieval benchmark that focuses on
continuous retrieval evaluation. This test collection is intended to be used to
study the temporal persistence of Information Retrieval systems and will be
used as the test collection in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance
Track (LongEval) at CLEF 2023. This benchmark simulates an evolving information
system environment - such as the one a Web search engine operates in - where
the document collection, the query distribution, and relevance all move
continuously, while following the Cranfield paradigm for offline evaluation. To
do that, we introduce the concept of a dynamic test collection that is composed
of successive sub-collections each representing the state of an information
system at a given time step. In LongEval-Retrieval, each sub-collection
contains a set of queries, documents, and soft relevance assessments built from
click models. The data comes from Qwant, a privacy-preserving Web search engine
that primarily focuses on the French market. LongEval-Retrieval also provides a
'mirror' collection: it is initially constructed in the French language to
benefit from the majority of Qwant's traffic, before being translated to
English. This paper presents the creation process of LongEval-Retrieval and
provides baseline runs and analysis.

					<dc:creator>Wouters, Michiel</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  I show that the dynamics of the weakly interacting bose gas can be described
by a modified time dependent Bogoliubov theory. The novelty of the approach is
to include decoherence steps that gradually transform the entanglement entropy
of the pure state into the von Neumann entropy of a statistical mixture. This
approximation drastically reduces the entanglement that is needed in order to
represent the system's state while becoming exponentially accurate in the mean
field limit. I argue that this scheme can be extended to all quantum systems
whose ground state can be well approximated by a variational wave function. The
upshot is that the dynamics of almost all quantum systems can be reduced to
stochastic classical motion supplemented with small quantum fluctuations.

					<dc:description>  This paper focuses on face stylization with a single artistic target.
Existing works for this task often fail to retain the source content while
achieving geometry variation. Here, we present a novel StyO model, ie. Stylize
the face in only One-shot, to solve the above problem. In particular, StyO
exploits a disentanglement and recombination strategy. It first disentangles
the content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are
then recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this
way, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,
and simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different
attributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face
geometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with
latent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier
Disentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents
identifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative
descriptions. And it introduces a novel triple reconstruction loss to fine-tune
the pre-trained LDM for encoding style and content into corresponding
identifiers; 2) Fine-grained Content Controller (FCC) for the recombination
phase. It recombines disentangled identifiers from IDL to form an augmented
text prompt for generating stylized faces. In addition, FCC also constrains the
cross-attention maps of latent and text features to preserve source face
details in results. The extensive evaluation shows that StyO produces
high-quality images on numerous paintings of various styles and outperforms the
current state-of-the-art. Code will be released upon acceptance.

					<dc:description>  Precise measurements of chemical abundances in planetary atmospheres are
necessary to constrain the formation histories of exoplanets. A recent study of
WASP-127b, a close-in puffy sub-Saturn orbiting its solar-type host star in 4.2
d, using HST and Spitzer revealed a feature-rich transmission spectrum with
strong excess absorption at 4.5 um. However, the limited spectral resolution
and coverage of these instruments could not distinguish between CO and/or CO2
absorption causing this signal, with both low and high C/O ratio scenarios
being possible. Here we present near-infrared (0.9--2.5 um) transit
observations of WASP-127 b using the high-resolution SPIRou spectrograph, with
the goal to disentangle CO from CO2 through the 2.3 um CO band. With SPIRou, we
detect H2O at a t-test significance of 5.3 sigma and observe a tentative (3
sigma) signal consistent with OH absorption. From a joint SPIRou + HST +
Spitzer retrieval analysis, we rule out a CO-rich scenario by placing an upper
limit on the CO abundance of log10[CO]&lt;-4.0, and estimate a log10[CO2] of
-3.7^(+0.8)_(-0.6), which is the level needed to match the excess absorption
seen at 4.5um. We also set abundance constraints on other major C-, O-, and
N-bearing molecules, with our results favoring low C/O (0.10^(+0.10)_(-0.06)),
disequilibrium chemistry scenarios. We further discuss the implications of our
results in the context of planet formation. Additional observations at high and
low-resolution will be needed to confirm these results and better our
understanding of this unusual world.

					<dc:description>  Molecular laser cooling and trapping requires addressing all spontaneous
decays to excited vibrational states that occur at the $\gtrsim 10^{-4} -
10^{-5}$ level, which is accomplished by driving repumping transitions out of
these states. However, the transitions must first be identified
spectroscopically at high-resolution. A typical approach is to prepare
molecules in excited vibrational states via optical cycling and pumping, which
requires multiple high-power lasers. Here, we demonstrate a general method to
perform this spectroscopy without the need for optical cycling. We produce
molecules in excited vibrational states by using optically-driven chemical
reactions in a cryogenic buffer gas cell, and implement frequency-modulated
absorption to perform direct, sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy. We
demonstrate this technique by measuring the spectrum of the
$\tilde{A}^2\Pi_{1/2}(1,0,0)-\tilde{X}^2\Sigma^+(3,0,0)$ band in $^{174}$YbOH.
We identify the specific vibrational repump transitions needed for photon
cycling, and combine our data with previous measurements of the
$\tilde{A}^2\Pi_{1/2}(1,0,0)-\tilde{X}^2\Sigma^+(0,0,0)$ band to determine all
of the relevant spectral constants of the $\tilde{X}^2\Sigma^+(3,0,0)$ state.
This technique achieves high signal-to-noise, can be further improved to
measure increasingly high-lying vibrational states, and is applicable to other
molecular species favorable for laser cooling.

					<dc:description>  We perform a numerical study of the distribution of entanglement on a
real-world fiber grid connecting the German cities of Bonn and Berlin. The
connection is realized using a chain of processing-node quantum repeaters
spanning roughly 900 kilometers. We investigate how minimal hardware
requirements depend on the target application, as well as on the number of
repeaters in the chain. We find that requirements for blind quantum computing
are markedly different than those for quantum key distribution, with the
required coherence time being around two and a half times larger for the
former. Further, we observe a trade-off regarding how target secret-key rates
are achieved when using different numbers of repeaters: comparatively
low-quality entangled states generated at a high rate are preferred for higher
numbers of repeaters, whereas comparatively high-quality states generated at a
lower rate are favored for lower numbers of repeaters. To obtain our results we
employ an extensive simulation framework implemented using NetSquid, a
discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. These are combined with an
optimization methodology based on genetic algorithms to determine minimal
hardware requirements.

					<dc:description>  The recent evolution in Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, in
particular in the field of argumentation mining, has the potential to transform
the way we interact with text, supporting the interpretation and analysis of
complex discourse and debates. Can a graphic visualisation of complex
argumentation enable a more critical interpretation of the arguments? This
study focuses on analysing the impact of argumentation graphs (AGs) compared
with regular texts for supporting argument interpretation. We found that AGs
outperformed the extrinsic metrics throughout most UEQ scales as well as the
NASA-TLX workload in all the terms but not in temporal or physical demand. The
AG model was liked by a more significant number of participants, despite the
fact that both the text-based and AG models yielded comparable outcomes in the
critical interpretation in terms of working memory and altering participants
decisions. The interpretation process involves reference to argumentation
schemes (linked to critical questions (CQs)) in AGs. Interestingly, we found
that the participants chose more CQs (using argument schemes in AGs) when they
were less familiar with the argument topics, making AG schemes on some scales
(relatively) supportive of the interpretation process. Therefore, AGs were
considered to deliver a more critical approach to argument interpretation,
especially with unfamiliar topics. Based on the 25 participants conducted in
this study, it appears that AG has demonstrated an overall positive effect on
the argument interpretation process.

					<dc:title>An upscaling based three parameter elastic anisotropy model</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Dontsov, E. V.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Physics - Geophysics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Rock formations often exhibit transversely anisotropic elastic behavior due
to their layered structure. Such materials are characterized by five
independent elastic constants. In the context of petroleum applications, it is
often challenging to accurately measure all these elastic parameters. At the
same time, the effect of elastic anisotropy can be noticeable and therefore
there is a need to include it in some form. To fill the gap, this study
proposes a three parameter elastic anisotropy model. It captures the dominant
anisotropic behavior and yet has only three elastic constants that are
relatively easy to measure in laboratory. The approach is based on upscaling of
a periodically layered material characterized by equal height layers with
different Young's moduli and the same Poisson's ratio. The resultant upscaled
material is transversely isotropic and is also physically admissible. The
developed approach allows to effectively reconstruct or estimate the values of
the two remaining parameters needed for the transversely isotropic model.
Comparison between the reconstructed results and the measured values are
compared for several rock types.

					<dc:description>  Sampling from Gibbs distributions $p(x) \propto \exp(-V(x)/\varepsilon)$ and
computing their log-partition function are fundamental tasks in statistics,
machine learning, and statistical physics. However, while efficient algorithms
are known for convex potentials $V$, the situation is much more difficult in
the non-convex case, where algorithms necessarily suffer from the curse of
dimensionality in the worst case. For optimization, which can be seen as a
low-temperature limit of sampling, it is known that smooth functions $V$ allow
faster convergence rates. Specifically, for $m$-times differentiable functions
in $d$ dimensions, the optimal rate for algorithms with $n$ function
evaluations is known to be $O(n^{-m/d})$, where the constant can potentially
depend on $m, d$ and the function to be optimized. Hence, the curse of
dimensionality can be alleviated for smooth functions at least in terms of the
convergence rate. Recently, it has been shown that similarly fast rates can
also be achieved with polynomial runtime $O(n^{3.5})$, where the exponent $3.5$
is independent of $m$ or $d$. Hence, it is natural to ask whether similar rates
for sampling and log-partition computation are possible, and whether they can
be realized in polynomial time with an exponent independent of $m$ and $d$. We
show that the optimal rates for sampling and log-partition computation are
sometimes equal and sometimes faster than for optimization. We then analyze
various polynomial-time sampling algorithms, including an extension of a recent
promising optimization approach, and find that they sometimes exhibit
interesting behavior but no near-optimal rates. Our results also give further
insights on the relation between sampling, log-partition, and optimization
problems.

					<dc:description>  Phylogenetic trees are frequently used to model evolution. Such trees are
typically reconstructed from data like DNA, RNA or protein alignments using
methods based on criteria like maximum parsimony (amongst others). Maximum
parsimony has been assumed to work well for data with only few state changes.
Recently, some progress has been made to formally prove this assertion. For
instance, it has been shown that each binary phylogenetic tree $T$ with $n \geq
20k$ leaves is uniquely defined by the set $A_k(T)$, which consists of all
characters with parsimony score $k$ on $T$. In the present manuscript, we show
that the statement indeed holds for all $n \geq 4k$, thus drastically lowering
the lower bound for $n$ from $20k$ to $4k$. However, it has been known that for
$n \leq 2k$ and $k \geq 3$, it is not generally true that $A_k(T)$ defines $T$.
We improve this result by showing that the latter statement can be extended
from $n \leq 2k$ to $n \leq 2k+2$. So we drastically reduce the gap of values
of $n$ for which it is unknown if trees $T$ on $n$ taxa are defined by $A_k(T)$
from the previous interval of $[2k+1,20k-1]$ to the interval $[2k+3,4k-1]$.
Moreover, we close this gap completely for the nearest neighbor interchange
(NNI) neighborhood of $T$, showing that as long as $n\geq 2k+3$, no tree that
is one NNI move away from $T$ (and thus very similar to $T$) shares the same
$A_k$ alignment.

					<dc:description>  This work addresses the issue of energy efficiency maximization in a
multi-user network aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with
global reflection capabilities. Two optimization methods are proposed to
optimize the mobile users' powers, the RIS coefficients and the linear receive
filters. Both methods are provably convergent and require only the solution of
convex optimization problems. The numerical results show that the proposed
methods largely outperform heuristic resource allocation schemes.

					<dc:description>  We propose a new simple model of acoustic black hole in a thin tube, where
the difference in the gravitational potential is used to create a transonic
flow. The main merit of our transonic flow model is that the Euler equations
can be solved analytically. In fact, we can obtain an exact solution to the
equation in terms of a height function in the monatomic case $\gamma=5/3$. For
arbitrary $\gamma$, we find that it takes a simple form by the near-sonic
approximation. Moreover, we obtain two analytic solutions describing a backward
wave and a forward wave, from which we can confirm the existence of sonic
horizons.

					<dc:title>Evaluating the Fairness of Deep Learning Uncertainty Estimates in

					<dc:description>  Although deep learning (DL) models have shown great success in many medical
image analysis tasks, deployment of the resulting models into real clinical
contexts requires: (1) that they exhibit robustness and fairness across
different sub-populations, and (2) that the confidence in DL model predictions
be accurately expressed in the form of uncertainties. Unfortunately, recent
studies have indeed shown significant biases in DL models across demographic
subgroups (e.g., race, sex, age) in the context of medical image analysis,
indicating a lack of fairness in the models. Although several methods have been
proposed in the ML literature to mitigate a lack of fairness in DL models, they
focus entirely on the absolute performance between groups without considering
their effect on uncertainty estimation. In this work, we present the first
exploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases
across subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance,
and their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive
experiments on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion
classification, (ii) brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimer's disease
clinical score regression. Our results indicate that popular ML methods, such
as data-balancing and distributionally robust optimization, succeed in
mitigating fairness issues in terms of the model performances for some of the
tasks. However, this can come at the cost of poor uncertainty estimates
associated with the model predictions. This tradeoff must be mitigated if
fairness models are to be adopted in medical image analysis.

					<dc:description>  Super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs are a timely topic in the last years in the
scientific community due to its connection to supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). Some
early studies tackled the possibility of white dwarfs surpassing the
Chandrasekhar limit by means of a magnetic field. More recently, modified
gravity has been highlighted as the reason for these stars to surpass the
Chandrasekhar limit and becoming a supernova progenitor. However, in general
simple assumptions are considered for the stellar structure and equation of
state (EoS), which can lead to unreliable conclusions. In this work, we want to
be rigorous and consider a realistic EoS to describe the white dwarfs in
general relativity and modified gravity, taking into account nuclear
instabilities that limit the maximum mass.

					<dc:description>  A substantial fraction of the cosmic baryons is expected to hide in the form
of diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), the majority of which resides
in the filaments of the Cosmic Web and has proven very difficult to detect due
to its low density. Close to galaxy clusters, the filament gas is affected by
the cluster's gravitational potential and attains substantial infall
velocities, eventually undergoing a termination shock which may boost its X-ray
signal. We aim to identify the optimal locations of the enhanced X-ray emission
and absorption arising from cluster-filament interactions, as well as improve
our understanding of the various physical processes affecting the WHIM as it
approaches the cluster. We applied the DisPerSE filament finder to the galaxy
distribution in the surroundings of a Coma-like ($M_{200} \sim 10^{15.4}~{\rm
M}_{\odot}$) simulated C-EAGLE galaxy cluster. We characterised the
thermodynamic properties of the gas in such filaments as well as their
dependence on distance from the cluster, and provided a physical interpretation
for the results. The identified filaments account for $\sim 50$% of the hot
WHIM ($T &gt; 10^{5.5}$ K) in the cluster vicinity. The filament gas is in
approximate free-fall all the way down to $\sim 2 \ r_{200}$ from the cluster,
at which stage it begins to slow down due to the increasing pressure of the
ambient gas. The deceleration is accompanied by the conversion of gas bulk
kinetic energy into heat and the increase of density and temperature from the
general Cosmic Web level of $\rho \sim 10\rho_{\rm av}$ and $T = 10^5-10^6$ K
towards $\rho \sim 100\rho_{\rm av}$ and $T = 10^7-10^8$ K near the cluster
boundary. We conclude that the detection of the cosmic filaments of galaxies
around clusters may provide a practical observational avenue for locating the
densest and hottest phase of the missing baryons.

					<dc:description>  We discuss layout and performance of a high-resolution Stimulated Raman Loss
spectrometer that has been newly developed for accurate studies of spectral
lineshapes and line center frequencies of hydrogen isotopologues and in general
of Raman active transitions. Thanks to the frequency comb calibration of the
detuning between pump and Stokes lasers and to an active alignment of the two
beams, the frequency accuracy is well below 100 kHz. Over the vertical axis the
spectrometer benefits from shot-noise limited detection, signal enhancement via
multipass cell, active flattening of the spectral baseline and measurement
times of few seconds over spectral spans larger than 10 GHz. Under these
conditions an efficient averaging of Raman spectra is possible over long
measurement times with minimal distortion of spectral lineshapes. By changing
the pump laser, transitions can be covered in a very broad frequency span, from
50 to 5000 $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, including both vibrational and rotational bands.
The spectrometer has been developed for studies of fundamental and collisional
physics of hydrogen isotopologues and has been recently applied to the
metrology of the Q(1) 1-0 line of $\mathrm{H_2}$.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we give a full classification of the nonexistence of positive
weak solutions to the semilinear elliptic inequality involving the fractional
Hardy potential in punctured and in exterior domains. Our methods are
self-contained and new. The main ideas and key ingredients will be discussed in
the next section after Theorem 1.1 for punctured domains, and after Theorem 1.4
for exterior domains. We will also explain why all the previous methods and
techniques do not apply to our general setting. Let us give here a foretaste of
our line of attack: Based on the imbalance between the Hardy operator and the
nonlinearity, we can obtain an initial asymptotic behavior rate at the origin (
for punctured domains) or at infinity ( exterior domains).We then improve this
rate by using the interaction with the nonlinearity. By repeating this process
finite number of times, a contradiction will be deduced from the nonexistence
for the related non-homogeneous fractional Hardy problem. This process allows
us to obtain the nonexistence for the fractional Hardy problem with larger
ranges . Our study covers all possible ranges, and our results are optimal.

					<dc:description>  Guaranteeing safe behavior on complex autonomous systems -- from cars to
walking robots -- is challenging due to the inherently high dimensional nature
of these systems and the corresponding complex models that may be difficult to
determine in practice. With this as motivation, this paper presents a
safety-critical control framework that leverages reduced order models to ensure
safety on the full order dynamics -- even when these models are subject to
disturbances and bounded inputs (e.g., actuation limits). To handle input
constraints, the backup set method is reformulated in the context of reduced
order models, and conditions for the provably safe behavior of the full order
system are derived. Then, the input-to-state safe backup set method is
introduced to provide robustness against discrepancies between the reduced
order model and the actual system. Finally, the proposed framework is
demonstrated in high-fidelity simulation, where a quadrupedal robot is safely
navigated around an obstacle with legged locomotion by the help of the unicycle
model.

					<dc:description>  We consider the recent data sets of quasi-periodic oscillations from eight
different low mass X-ray binaries. We here interpret their physical features in
the context of given regular black hole solutions and verify their
applicability to neutron star configurations. We evaluate the numerical
constraints over the free parameters of Bardeen, Hayward and Dymnikova regular
solutions by performing a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses, based on
the Metropolis algorithm. For each source, we evaluate the best-fit parameters,
among which mass and magnetic charge, and compare and contrast them with the
current literature. We also infer the corresponding innermost stable circular
orbit radii and the radial extents of the accretion disks. Focusing on how to
identify discrepancies among theoretical models and observations, our results
show that, in most of the cases, regular black holes, in particular the Bardeen
and Hayward spacetimes are slightly more suitable to describe neutron stars
than Schwarzschild geometry, whereas the Dymnikova metric is ruled out.

					<dc:title>Know Your Cybercriminal: Evaluating Attacker Preferences by Measuring
  Profile Sales on an Active, Leading Criminal Market for User Impersonation at

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper we exploit market features proper of a leading Russian
cybercrime market for user impersonation at scale to evaluate attacker
preferences when purchasing stolen user profiles, and the overall economic
activity of the market. We run our data collection over a period of $161$ days
and collect data on a sample of $1'193$ sold user profiles out of $11'357$
advertised products in that period and their characteristics. We estimate a
market trade volume of up to approximately $700$ profiles per day,
corresponding to estimated daily sales of up to $4'000$ USD and an overall
market revenue within the observation period between $540k$ and $715k$ USD. We
find profile provision to be rather stable over time and mainly focused on
European profiles, whereas actual profile acquisition varies significantly
depending on other profile characteristics. Attackers' interests focus
disproportionally on profiles of certain types, including those originating in
North America and featuring $crypto$ resources. We model and evaluate the
relative importance of different profile characteristics in the final decision
of an attacker to purchase a profile, and discuss implications for defenses and
risk evaluation.

					<dc:description>  In-hand pivoting is one of the important manipulation skills that leverage
robot grippers' extrinsic dexterity to perform repositioning tasks to
compensate for environmental uncertainties and imprecise motion execution.
Although many researchers have been trying to solve pivoting problems using
mathematical modeling or learning-based approaches, the problems remain as open
challenges. On the other hand, humans perform in-hand manipulation with
remarkable precision and speed. Hence, the solution could be provided by making
full use of this intrinsic human skill through dexterous teleoperation. For
dexterous teleoperation to be successful, interfaces that enhance and
complement haptic feedback are of great necessity. In this paper, we propose a
cutaneous feedback interface that complements the somatosensory information
humans rely on when performing dexterous skills. The interface is designed
based on five-bar link mechanisms and provides two contact points in the index
finger and thumb for cutaneous feedback. By integrating the interface with a
commercially available haptic device, the system can display information such
as grasping force, shear force, friction, and grasped object's pose. Passive
pivoting tasks inside a numerical simulator Isaac Sim is conducted to evaluate
the effect of the proposed cutaneous feedback interface.

					<dc:description>  Motivated by problems in which data are given over covering generating
families, we suggest a new cohomology theory for diffeological spaces, called
diffeological \v{C}ech cohomology, which is an exact $ \partial $-functor of
the section functor for sheaves on diffeological spaces. As applications, under
the situations of a setup, i) the generalized Mayer-Vietoris sequence for a
diffeological space is established; ii) a version of the de Rham theorem is
obtained, which connects diffeological \v{C}ech cohomology to the de Rham
cohomology. Moreover, we characterize the isomorphism classes of diffeological
fiber, principal, and vector bundles as (non-abelian) diffeological \v{C}ech
cohomology in degree 1.

					<dc:description>  This paper describes a novel approach to combine sixteen high resolution deep
UV (DUV EX4, 248 nm lithography) full reticle (22 mm x 22 mm) circuits to
fabricate an extremely large (88 mm x 88 mm) area superconducting integrated
circuit (ELASIC). The fabrication process starts by interconnecting four high
resolution DUV EX4 (22 mm x 22 mm) full reticles using single large field (44
mm x 44 mm) I-line (365 nm lithography) reticle, followed by I-line reticle
stitching at the boundaries of 44 mm x 44 mm fields to fabricate the complete
ELASIC field (88 mm x 88 mm). Stitched linewidths of 0.8 micron maintained high
superconducting critical currents (&gt;30 mA) for ELASIC. Quantum flux parametron
(QFP) circuits were measured at 4.2 K to demonstrate the viability of common
active components used for data buffering and transmission. Overall, this is
the first demonstration of such a large IC produced by interconnecting high
resolution DUV reticles without stitching individual reticles.

					<dc:description>  This paper studies the online stochastic resource allocation problem (RAP)
with chance constraints. The online RAP is a 0-1 integer linear programming
problem where the resource consumption coefficients are revealed column by
column along with the corresponding revenue coefficients. When a column is
revealed, the corresponding decision variables are determined instantaneously
without future information. Moreover, in online applications, the resource
consumption coefficients are often obtained by prediction. To model their
uncertainties, we take the chance constraints into the consideration. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time chance constraints are introduced
in the online RAP problem. Assuming that the uncertain variables have known
Gaussian distributions, the stochastic RAP can be transformed into a
deterministic but nonlinear problem with integer second-order cone constraints.
Next, we linearize this nonlinear problem and analyze the performance of
vanilla online primal-dual algorithm for solving the linearized stochastic RAP.
Under mild technical assumptions, the optimality gap and constraint violation
are both on the order of $\sqrt{n}$. Then, to further improve the performance
of the algorithm, several modified online primal-dual algorithms with heuristic
corrections are proposed. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on both
synthetic and real data demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our
methods.

					<dc:description>  Here we analyze three dimensional analogues of the classical Crofton's
formula for planar compact convex sets. In this formula a fundamental role is
played by the visual angle of the convex set from an exterior point. A
generalization of the visual angle to convex sets in euclidian space is the
visual solid angle. This solid angle, being an spherically convex set in the
unit sphere, has length, area and other geometric quantities to be considered.
The main goal of this note is to express invariant quantities of the original
convex set depending on volume, surface area and mean curvature integral by
means of integrals of functions related to the solid angle.

					<dc:description>  Optical phased arrays (OPA) with high integration, fast speed, low power
consumption, and high steering resolution are critical components in the
emerging photonic integrated circuit (PIC), LiDAR, free space optical
communication, 3D printing, and so on. According to the OPA working principle,
its function is generally achieved by independently controlling the phase of
the array elements. In practice, this presents a major challenge to overcome
critical trade-offs of the element numbers, the control electronics, and the
power consumption. Here, we give an alternative OPA solution to overcome this
technical limitation, in the form of a cascaded periodically poled
electro-optical crystal structure. Compared with the existing OPA scheme, only
one control electronics is used to control the entire array elements in the
current proposal, regardless of the number of array elements, implying higher
integration and lower power consumption. With the help of the fast response
properties of electro-optic crystal materials, a high-speed and high-resolution
beam steering device is demonstrated. Simulating results show that the angular
resolution can be improved by several orders of magnitude when the number of
the cascaded-layer increases. An OPA prototype of a 6-layer cascaded
periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ (cascaded-PPLN) was designed, fabricated, and
characterized. The experiment that observed beam deflection in cascaded-PPLN
OPA agrees well with the simulation results. Meantime, by demonstrating dynamic
beam steering continually, its capability of continuous scanning and
continually active phase tunability has been verified. Therefore, this cascaded
periodically poled electro-optical crystal OPA offers a feasible direction of
miniaturization and low power consumption for the optical system, such as the
PIC system.

					<dc:description>  This paper is an adaptation of the introduction to a book project by the late
Mitchell J. Feigenbaum (1944-2019). While Feigenbaum is certainly mostly known
for his theory of period doubling cascades, he had a lifelong interest in
optics. His book project is an extremely original discussion of the apparently
very simple study of anamorphs, that is, the reflections of images on a
cylindrical mirror. He observed that there are \emph{two images} to be seen in
the tube, and discovered that the brain preferentially chooses one of them. I
edited and wrote an introduction to this planned book. As the book is still not
published, I have now adapted my introduction as a standalone version, so that
some Feigenbaum's remarkable work will be accessible to a larger audience.

					<dc:description>  The mass of an astrophysical object can be estimated by the amount of
gravitational lensing of another object that it causes. To arrive at the
estimation however, one assumes the validity of the inverse square law of
gravity, or equivalently an attractive $1/r$ potential. We show that the above,
augmented by a logarithmic potential at galactic length scales, proposed
earlier to explain the flat galaxy rotation curves, predicts a larger
deflection angle for a given mass. In other words, the true mass of the object
is less than its estimated value. This may diminish the importance and role of
dark matter in explaining various observations.

					<dc:description>  Neural networks have recently gained attention in solving inverse problems.
One prominent methodology are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which
can solve both forward and inverse problems. In the paper at hand, full
waveform inversion is the considered inverse problem. The performance of PINNs
is compared against classical adjoint optimization, focusing on three key
aspects: the forward-solver, the neural network Ansatz for the inverse field,
and the sensitivity computation for the gradient-based minimization. Starting
from PINNs, each of these key aspects is adapted individually until the
classical adjoint optimization emerges. It is shown that it is beneficial to
use the neural network only for the discretization of the unknown material
field, where the neural network produces reconstructions without oscillatory
artifacts as typically encountered in classical full waveform inversion
approaches. Due to this finding, a hybrid approach is proposed. It exploits
both the efficient gradient computation with the continuous adjoint method as
well as the neural network Ansatz for the unknown material field. This new
hybrid approach outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the classical
adjoint optimization in settings of two and three-dimensional examples.

					<dc:description>  We present the implementation of two-moment based general-relativistic
multi-group radiation transport module in the $\texttt{G}$eneral-relativistic
$\texttt{mu}$ltigrid $\texttt{nu}$merical ($\texttt{Gmunu}$) code.
  On top of solving the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and the
Einstein equations with conformally flat approximations, the code solves the
evolution equations of the zeroth- and first-order moments of the radiations.
  Analytic closure relation is used to obtain the higher order moments and
close the system.
  The finite-volume discretisation has been adopted for the radiation moments.
  The advection in spatial and frequency spaces are handled explicitly.
  In addition, the radiation-matter interaction terms, which are very stiff in
the optically thick region, are solved implicitly.
  Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes are adopted for time integration.
  We test the implementation with a number of numerical benchmarks from
frequency-integrated to frequency dependent cases.
  Furthermore, we also illustrate the astrophysical applications in hot neutron
star and core-collapse supernovae modellings, and compare with other neutrino
transport codes.

					<dc:description>  We introduce a new approach to the the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) by
means of which we establish the standard AIM connection with the continued
fractions technique and we develop a novel termination condition in terms of
the approximants. With the help of this alternative termination condition and
certain properties of continuous fractions, we derive a closed formula for the
asymptotic function $\alpha$ of the AIM technique in terms of an infinite
series. Furthermore, we show that such a series converges pointwise to $\alpha$
which, in turn, can be interpreted as a specific term of the minimal solution
of a certain recurrence relation. We also investigate some conditions ensuring
the existence of a minimal solution and hence, of the function $\alpha$ itself.

					<dc:subject>Mathematics - Algebraic Geometry</dc:subject>

					<dc:description>  We study the weighted constant scalar curvature, a modified scalar curvature
introduced by Lahdili depending on weight functions $(v, w)$, on certain
non-compact semisimple toric fibrations, a generalization of the Calabi Ansatz
defined by Apostolov--Calderbank--Gauduchon--T{\o}nnesen-Friedman. We show that
the natural analog of the weighted Futaki invariant of Lahdili can under
reasonable assumptions be interpreted on an unbounded polyhedron $P \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$ associated to $M$. In particular, we fix a certain class
$\mathcal{W}$ of weights $(v, w)$, and prove that if $M$ admits a weighted cscK
metric, then $P$ is K-stable, and we give examples of weights on $\mathbb{C}^2$
for which the weighted Futaki invariant vanishes but do not admit $(v, w)$-cscK
metrics. Following Jubert, we introduce a weighted Mabuchi energy
$\mathcal{M}_{v,w}$ and show that the existence of a $(v, w)$-cscK metric
implies that it $\mathcal{M}_{v,w}$ proper, and prove a uniqueness result using
the method of Guan. We show that weighted K-stability of the abstract fiber
$\mathbb{C}$ is sufficient for the existence of weighted cscK metrics on the
total space of line bundles $L \rightarrow B$ over a compact K\&quot;ahler base,
extending a result of Lahdili in the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles case. The right
choice of weights corresponds to the (shrinking) K\&quot;ahler-Ricci soliton
equation, and we give an interpretation of the asyptotic geometry in this case.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Recent reports of emergency aircraft evacuations have highlighted an
increasing tendency amongst evacuees to ignore clear safety warnings and to
collect and carry personal items of baggage during egress. However, relatively
little work has so far been done on quantifying the impact of such behaviour on
the evacuation process. In this paper, we report the results of validated
simulation experiments (using the Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft), which confirm
that even a relatively low level of baggage collection can significantly delay
evacuation. Our platform provides one possible framework for the investigation
of processes and mitigation tactics to minimise the impact of baggage
collection behaviour in future.

					<dc:description>  We consider two questions on the geometry of Lipschitz free $p$-spaces
$\mathcal F_p$, where $0&lt;p\leq 1$, over subsets of finite-dimensional vector
spaces. We solve an open problem and show that if $(\mathcal M, \rho)$ is an
infinite doubling metric space (e.g., an infinite subset of an Euclidean
space), then $\mathcal F_p (\mathcal M, \rho^\alpha)\simeq\ell_p$ for every
$\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $0&lt;p\leq 1$. An upper bound on the Banach-Mazur distance
between the spaces $\mathcal F_p ([0, 1]^d, |\cdot|^\alpha)$ and $\ell_p$ is
given. Moreover, we tackle a question due to arXiv:2006.08018v1 [math.FA] and
expound the role of $p$, $d$ for the Lipschitz constant of a canonical, locally
coordinatewise affine retraction from $(K, |\cdot|_1)$, where $K=\bigcup_{Q\in
\mathcal R} Q$ is a union of a collection $\emptyset \neq \mathcal R \subseteq
\{ Rw + R[0,1]^d: w\in\mathbb Z^d\}$ of cubes in $\mathbb R^d$ with side length
$R&gt;0$, into the Lipschitz free $p$-space $\mathcal F_p (V, |\cdot|_1)$ over
their vertices.

					<dc:description>  Fine-tuning is widely used as the default algorithm for transfer learning
from pre-trained models. Parameter inefficiency can however arise when, during
transfer learning, all the parameters of a large pre-trained model need to be
updated for individual downstream tasks. As the number of parameters grows,
fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. In addition,
full fine-tuning can become prohibitively expensive when the model is used for
many tasks. To mitigate this issue, parameter-efficient transfer learning
algorithms, such as adapters and prefix tuning, have been proposed as a way to
introduce a few trainable parameters that can be plugged into large pre-trained
language models such as BERT, and HuBERT. In this paper, we introduce the
Speech UndeRstanding Evaluation (SURE) benchmark for parameter-efficient
learning for various speech-processing tasks. Additionally, we introduce a new
adapter, ConvAdapter, based on 1D convolution. We show that ConvAdapter
outperforms the standard adapters while showing comparable performance against
prefix tuning and LoRA with only 0.94% of trainable parameters on some of the
task in SURE. We further explore the effectiveness of parameter efficient
transfer learning for speech synthesis task such as Text-to-Speech (TTS).

					<dc:description>  Quantum simulation is a powerful tool to study the properties of quantum
systems. The dynamics of open quantum systems are often described by Completely
Positive (CP) maps, for which several quantum simulation schemes exist. We
present a simulation scheme for open qubit dynamics described by a larger class
of maps: the general dynamical maps which are linear, hermitian preserving and
trace preserving but not necessarily positivity preserving. The latter suggests
an underlying system-reservoir model where both are entangled and thus
non-Markovian qubit dynamics. Such maps also come about as the inverse of CP
maps. We illustrate our simulation scheme on an IBM quantum processor by
showing that we can recover the initial state of a Lindblad evolution. This
paves the way for a novel form of quantum error mitigation. Our scheme only
requires one ancilla qubit as an overhead and a small number of one and two
qubit gates.

					<dc:description>  Logical relations built on top of an operational semantics are one of the
most successful proof methods in programming language semantics. In recent
years, more and more expressive notions of operationally-based logical
relations have been designed and applied to specific families of languages.
However, a unifying abstract framework for operationally-based logical
relations is still missing. We show how fibrations can provide a uniform
treatment of operational logical relations, using as reference example a
lambda-calculus with generic effects endowed with a novel, abstract operational
semantics defined on a large class of categories. Moreover, this abstract
perspective allows us to give a solid mathematical ground also to differential
logical relations -- a recently introduced notion of higher-order distance
between programs -- both pure and effectful, bringing them back to a common
picture with traditional ones.

					<dc:description>  Stochastic and adversarial data are two widely studied settings in online
learning. But many optimization tasks are neither i.i.d. nor fully adversarial,
which makes it of fundamental interest to get a better theoretical
understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish
novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that
interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By
exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence
on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was
previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d.
assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were
previously considered in the related expert and bandit settings. In the fully
i.i.d. case, our regret bounds match the rates one would expect from results in
stochastic acceleration, and we also recover the optimal stochastically
accelerated rates via online-to-batch conversion. In the fully adversarial case
our bounds gracefully deteriorate to match the minimax regret. We further
provide lower bounds showing that our regret upper bounds are tight for all
intermediate regimes in terms of the stochastic variance and the adversarial
variation of the loss gradients.

					<dc:description>  In this work, we consider a mixed local and nonlocal Dirichlet problem with
supercritical nonlinearity. We establish a multiplicity result for the problem
  \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u+(-\Delta)^su=|u|^{p-2}u+\mu|u|^{q-2}u~~\text{in}~~\Omega,~~~~~
u=0~~\text{in}~~\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega,~~~ (0.1)
  \end{equation}
  where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain, $s\in(0,1)$ and
$1&lt;q&lt;2&lt;p$. Precisely, we show that there exists $\mu_{\#}&gt;0$ such that problem
(0.1) has a sequence of solutions with a negative energy for
$\mu\in(0,\mu_{\#})$. Moreover, whenever the domain is symmetric, we also prove
the existence of symmetric solutions. The techniques we use rely on new
variational principles recently developed by the second author that allow to
deal with supercritical problems when the corresponding Euler-Lagrange
functional is restricted to certain convex sets.

					<dc:description>  The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) describes the appearance of a transverse
voltage when a longitudinal voltage is applied in the presence of broken
time-reversal symmetry. The AHE plays a prominent role in the study of
topological quantum materials in which it results from the electronic Berry
curvature. More recently, it has been recognized that certain magnetic point
group symmetries can significantly enrich the anomalous Hall response by
higher-order terms, which are induced by Berry curvature multipoles. Here we
report the observation of the 3rd order AHE at room temperature in epitaxially
grown thin films of the kagome antiferromagnet FeSn. When a longitudinal a.c.
drive current at frequency \omega is applied, the 3rd order AHE appears as a
transverse voltage response at 3\omega from cryogenic conditions to above room
temperature in the presence of a magnetic field. Our scaling analysis of the
charge carrier scattering time reveals the almost purely topological origin of
3rd order anomalous Hall response at room temperature. Conducting a symmetry
analysis, model and ab-initio calculations, and magnetic Monte Carlo
simulations, we demonstrate this intrinsic contribution can be attributed to
the Berry curvature quadrupole moment, which arises in the spin-canted state of
FeSn. Our measurements establish the 3rd order nonlinear AHE as a sensitive
electrical transport probe to investigate antiferromagnetic phase transitions
in a variety of materials. Because Berry curvature multipole effects are
predicted to exist for 90 magnetic point groups, our work opens a new field to
study a variety of topological magnetic materials through their nonlinear
anomalous Hall response. Observing the 3rd order nonlinear AHE at room
temperature in an epitaxially grown material platform, we demonstrate a new
type of Hall effect with potential technological applications as frequency
multiplier elements.

					<dc:description>  We investigate the finite-size origin of the emission linewidth of a
spatially-extended, one-dimensional non-equilibrium condensate. We show that
the well-known Schawlow-Townes scaling of laser theory, possibly including the
Henry broadening factor, only holds for small system sizes, while in larger
systems the linewidth displays a novel scaling determined by
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang physics. This is shown to lead to an opposite dependence of
the linewidth on the optical nonlinearity in the two cases. We then study how
sub-universal properties of the phase dynamics such as the higher moments of
the phase-phase correlator are affected by the finite size and discuss the
relation between the field coherence and the exponential of the phase-phase
correlator. We finally identify a configuration with enhanced open boundary
conditions, which supports a spatially uniform steady-state and facilitates
experimental studies of the linewidth scaling.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a distributionally robust model predictive control
framework for the control of wind farms with the goal of power tracking and
mechanical stress reduction of the individual wind turbines. We introduce an
ARMA model to predict the turbulent wind speed, where we merely assume that the
residuals are sub-Gaussian noise with statistics contained in an moment-based
ambiguity set. We employ a recently developed distributionally model predictive
control scheme to ensure constraint satisfaction and recursive feasibility of
the control algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a
practical example of five wind turbines in a row.

					<dc:description>  Feedback loops are essential for regulating cell proliferation and
maintaining the delicate balance between cell division and cell death. Thanks
to the exact solution of a few simple models of cell growth it is by now clear
that stochastic fluctuations play a central role in this process and that cell
growth (and in particular the robustness and stability of homeostasis) can be
properly addressed only as a stochastic process. Using epidermal homeostasis as
a prototypical example, we show that it is possible to discriminate among
different feedback strategies which turn out to be characterized by different,
experimentally testable, behaviours. In particular, we focus on the so-called
Dynamical Heterogeneity model, an epidermal homeostasis model that takes into
account two well known cellular features: the plasticity of the cells and their
adaptability to face environmental stimuli. We show that specific choices of
the parameter on which the feedback is applied may decrease the fluctuations of
the homeostatic population level and improve the recovery of the system after
an external perturbation.

					<dc:description>  Despite significant progress in understanding and improving faithfulness in
abstractive summarization, the question of how decoding strategies affect
faithfulness is less studied. We present a systematic study of the effect of
generation techniques such as beam search and nucleus sampling on faithfulness
in abstractive summarization. We find a consistent trend where beam search with
large beam sizes produces the most faithful summaries while nucleus sampling
generates the least faithful ones. We propose two faithfulness-aware generation
methods to further improve faithfulness over current generation techniques: (1)
ranking candidates generated by beam search using automatic faithfulness
metrics and (2) incorporating lookahead heuristics that produce a faithfulness
score on the future summary. We show that both generation methods significantly
improve faithfulness across two datasets as evaluated by four automatic
faithfulness metrics and human evaluation. To reduce computational cost, we
demonstrate a simple distillation approach that allows the model to generate
faithful summaries with just greedy decoding. Our code is publicly available at

					<dc:description>  The analysis of EEG/MEG functional connectivity has become an important tool
in neural research. Especially the high time resolution of EEG/MEG enables
important insight into the functioning of the human brain. To date, functional
connectivity is commonly estimated offline, i.e., after the conclusion of the
experiment. However, online computation of functional connectivity has the
potential to enable unique experimental paradigms. For example, changes of
functional connectivity due to learning processes could be tracked in real time
and the experiment be adjusted based on these observations. Furthermore, the
connectivity estimates can be used for neurofeedback applications or the
instantaneous inspection of measurement results. In this study, we present the
implementation and evaluation of online sensor and source space functional
connectivity estimation in the open-source software MNE Scan. Online capable
implementations of several functional connectivity metrics were established in
the Connectivity library within MNE-CPP and made available as a plugin in MNE
Scan. Online capability was achieved by enforcing multithreading and high
efficiency for all computations, so that repeated computations were avoided
wherever possible, which allows for a major speed-up in the case of overlapping
intervalls. We present comprehensive performance evaluations of these
implementations proving the online capability for the computation of large
all-to-all functional connectivity networks. As a proof of principle, we
demonstrate the feasibility of online functional connectivity estimation in the
evaluation of somatosensory evoked brain activity.

					<dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method for quantum circuit
optimisation. However, the state space that has to be explored by an RL agent
is extremely large when considering all the possibilities in which a quantum
circuit can be transformed through local rewrite operations. This state space
explosion slows down the learning of RL-based optimisation strategies. We
present for the first time how to use graph neural network (GNN) autoencoders
for the optimisation of quantum circuits. We construct directed acyclic graphs
from the quantum circuits, encode the graphs and use the encodings to represent
RL states. We illustrate our proof of concept implementation on
Bernstein-Vazirani circuits and, from preliminary results, we conclude that our
autoencoder approach: a) maintains the optimality of the original RL method; b)
reduces by 20 \% the size of the table that encodes the learned optimisation
strategy. Our method is the first realistic first step towards very large scale
RL quantum circuit optimisation.

					<dc:description>  Localization is an essential capability for mobile robots. A rapidly growing
field of research in this area is Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which is the
ability to recognize previously seen places in the world based solely on
images. This present work is the first tutorial paper on visual place
recognition. It unifies the terminology of VPR and complements prior research
in two important directions: 1) It provides a systematic introduction for
newcomers to the field, covering topics such as the formulation of the VPR
problem, a general-purpose algorithmic pipeline, an evaluation methodology for
VPR approaches, and the major challenges for VPR and how they may be addressed.
2) As a contribution for researchers acquainted with the VPR problem, it
examines the intricacies of different VPR problem types regarding input, data
processing, and output. The tutorial also discusses the subtleties behind the
evaluation of VPR algorithms, e.g., the evaluation of a VPR system that has to
find all matching database images per query, as opposed to just a single match.
Practical code examples in Python illustrate to prospective practitioners and
researchers how VPR is implemented and evaluated.

					<dc:description>  For more than half a century, vibratory bowl feeders have been the standard
in automated assembly for singulation, orientation, and manipulation of small
parts. Unfortunately, these feeders are expensive, noisy, and highly
specialized on a single part design bases. We consider an alternative device
and learning control method for singulation, orientation, and manipulation by
means of seven fixed-position variable-energy solenoid impulse actuators
located beneath a semi-rigid part supporting surface. Using computer vision to
provide part pose information, we tested various machine learning (ML)
algorithms to generate a control policy that selects the optimal actuator and
actuation energy. Our manipulation test object is a 6-sided craps-style die.
Using the most suitable ML algorithm, we were able to flip the die to any
desired face 30.4\% of the time with a single impulse, and 51.3\% with two
chosen impulses, versus a random policy succeeding 5.1\% of the time (that is,
a randomly chosen impulse delivered by a randomly chosen solenoid).

					<dc:description>  Human-AI interaction in text production increases complexity in authorship.
In two empirical studies (n1 = 30 &amp; n2 = 96), we investigate authorship and
ownership in human-AI collaboration for personalized language generation
models. We show an AI Ghostwriter Effect: Users do not consider themselves the
owners and authors of AI-generated text but refrain from publicly declaring AI
authorship. The degree of personalization did not impact the AI Ghostwriter
Effect, and control over the model increased participants' sense of ownership.
We also found that the discrepancy between the sense of ownership and the
authorship declaration is stronger in interactions with a human ghostwriter and
that people use similar rationalizations for authorship in AI ghostwriters and
human ghostwriters. We discuss how our findings relate to psychological
ownership and human-AI interaction to lay the foundations for adapting
authorship frameworks and user interfaces in AI in text-generation tasks.

					<dc:description>  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are useful tools to
model environments where the full state cannot be perceived by an agent. As
such the agent needs to reason taking into account the past observations and
actions. However, simply remembering the full history is generally intractable
due to the exponential growth in the history space. Keeping a probability
distribution that models the belief over what the true state is can be used as
a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to
the model of the environment and is also intractable. Current state-of-the-art
algorithms use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to compress the
observation-action history aiming to learn a sufficient statistic, but they
lack guarantees of success and can lead to suboptimal policies. To overcome
this, we propose the Wasserstein-Belief-Updater (WBU), an RL algorithm that
learns a latent model of the POMDP and an approximation of the belief update.
Our approach comes with theoretical guarantees on the quality of our
approximation ensuring that our outputted beliefs allow for learning the
optimal value function.

					<dc:description>  The recent discovery of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$
($\bar{u}\bar{d}cc$) provides a stringent constraint on its binding energy
relative to its lowest decay threshold. We use a fully convergent spatial wave
function and perform a simultaneous global fit to both the meson and baryon
spectra. Our analysis shows that a Yukawa type hyperfine potential leads to a
slight bound state for $T_{cc}$ with $(I,S) = (0,1)$ below its lowest
threshold, in agreement with recent experimental findings. We also find that
$T_{cc}$ is highly likely to be in a compact configuration.

					<dc:description>  Lead free, silicon compatible materials showing large electromechanical
responses comparable to, or better than conventional relaxor ferroelectrics,
are desirable for various nanoelectromechanical devices and applications.
Defect-engineered electrostriction has recently been gaining popularity to
obtain enhanced electromechanical responses at sub 100 Hz frequencies. Here, we
report record values of electrostrictive strain coefficients (M31) at
frequencies as large as 5 kHz (1.04 x 10-14 m2 per V2 at 1 kHz, and 3.87 x
10-15 m2 per V2 at 5 kHz) using A-site and oxygen-deficient barium titanate
thin-films, epitaxially integrated onto Si. The effect is robust and retained
even after cycling the devices &gt;5000 times. Our perovskite films are
non-ferroelectric, exhibit a different symmetry compared to stoichiometric
BaTiO3 and are characterized by twin boundaries and nano polar-like regions. We
show that the dielectric relaxation arising from the defect-induced features
correlates very well with the observed giant electrostrictive response. These
films show large coefficient of thermal expansion (2.36 x 10-5/K), which along
with the giant M31 implies a considerable increase in the lattice anharmonicity
induced by the defects. Our work provides a crucial step forward towards
formulating guidelines to engineer large electromechanical responses even at
higher frequencies in lead-free thin films.

					<dc:description>  In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) in enhancing wireless signal coverage through field trials.
Specifically, we design a prototype consisting of 160 RIS cells operating in
the Sub-6 Gigahertz band, and develop a wireless control scheme and novel
beamforming algorithms for the RIS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RIS
prototype and algorithm, we conduct experiments in multi-block RIS and
multi-hop RIS scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the RIS can provide an
average signal power gain of 20 dB when using a pair of horn antennas as
transceiver terminals, and an average gain of over 5 dB when using a Wi-Fi
router and a mobile device as transceiver terminals. Furthermore, RIS can
improve the data transmission rate, jitter delay, packet loss rate, and other
communication performance indices.

					<dc:description>  Ultrafast optical control of quantum systems is an emerging field of physics.
In particular, the possibility of light-driven superconductivity with
ultrashort laser pulses has attracted much of attention. To identify
non-equilibrium superconductivity, it is necessary to measure fingerprints of
superconductivity on ultrafast timescales. Recently non-linear THz third
harmonic generation (THG) was shown to directly probe the collective degrees of
freedoms of the superconducting condensate including particularly the Higgs
mode. Here we extend this idea to light-driven non-equilibrium states in
superconducting La2-xSrxCuO4 establishing a protocol to access the transient
superconducting (SC) order-parameter fluctuations. We perform an optical
pump-THz-THG drive experiment and use a two-dimensional spectroscopy approach
to disentangle the driven third-harmonic response of optically excited
quasiparticles and the pure condensate response. In this way, 2D spectroscopy
separately probes both the ultrafast pair breaking dynamics and transient
pairing amplitude of the condensate.

datasets to advance robust models' development. There is a surge of QA datasets
for languages like English, however, this is not true for Amharic. Amharic, the
official language of Ethiopia, is the second most spoken Semitic language in
the world. There is no published or publicly available Amharic QA dataset.
Hence, to foster the research in Amharic QA, we present the first Amharic QA
(AmQA) dataset. We crowdsourced 2628 question-answer pairs over 378 Wikipedia
articles. Additionally, we run an XLMR Large-based baseline model to spark
open-domain QA research interest. The best-performing baseline achieves an
F-score of 69.58 and 71.74 in reader-retriever QA and reading comprehension

					<dc:description>  We study black-box testing for stochastic systems and arbitrary
$\omega$-regular specifications, explicitly including liveness properties. We
are given a finite-state probabilistic system that we can only execute from the
initial state. We have no information on the number of reachable states, or on
the probabilities; further, we can only partially observe the states. The only
action we can take is to restart the system. We design restart strategies
guaranteeing that, if the specification is violated with non-zero probability,
then w.p.1 the number of restarts is finite, and the infinite run executed
after the last restart violates the specification. This improves on previous
work that required full observability. We obtain asymptotically optimal upper
bounds on the expected number of steps until the last restart. We conduct
experiments on a number of benchmarks, and show that our strategies allow one
to find violations in Markov chains much larger than the ones considered in
previous work.

					<dc:description>  In real world domains, most graphs naturally exhibit a hierarchical
structure. However, data-driven graph generation is yet to effectively capture
such structures. To address this, we propose a novel approach that recursively
generates community structures at multiple resolutions, with the generated
structures conforming to training data distribution at each level of the
hierarchy. The graphs generation is designed as a sequence of coarse-to-fine
generative models allowing for parallel generation of all sub-structures,
resulting in a high degree of scalability. Furthermore, we model the output
distribution of edges with a more expressive multinomial distribution and
derive a recursive factorization for this distribution, making it a suitable
choice for graph generative models. This allows for the generation of graphs
with integer-valued edge weights. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency on multiple datasets.

					<dc:description>  We examine the routing problem for self-interested vehicles using stochastic
decision strategies. By approximating the road latency functions and a
non-linear variable transformation, we frame the problem as an aggregative
game. We characterize the approximation error and we derive a new monotonicity
condition for a broad category of games that encompasses the problem under
consideration. Next, we propose a semi-decentralized algorithm to calculate the
routing as a variational generalized Nash equilibrium and demonstrate the
solution's benefits with numerical simulations. We also explore a recursive
receding-horizon formulation of the routing problem for potential games,
showing asymptotic convergence to destinations and analysing closed-loop
performance dependence on horizon length through numerical simulations.

					<dc:description>  By a well known theorem of Robbins, a graph $G$ has a strongly connected
orientation if and only if $G$ is 2-edge-connected and it is easy to find, in
linear time, either a cut edge of $G$ or a strong orientation of $G$.
  A result of Durand de Gevigny shows that for every $k\geq 3$ it is NP-hard to
decide if a given graph $G$ has a $k$-strong orientation. Thomassen showed that
one can check in polynomial time whether a given graph has a 2-strong
orientation. This implies that for a given digraph $D$ we can determine in
polynomial time whether we can reorient (=reverse) some arcs of $D=(V,A)$ to
obtain a 2-strong digraph $D'=(V,A')$. This naturally leads to the question of
determining the minimum number of such arcs to reverse before the resulting
graph is 2-strong. In this paper we show that finding this number is NP-hard.
  If a 2-connected graph $G$ has no 2-strong orientation, we may ask how many
of its edges we may orient so that the resulting mixed graph is still 2-strong.
Similarly, we may ask for a 2-edge-connected graph $G$ how many of its edges we
can orient such that the resulting mixed graph remains 2-arc-strong. We prove
that when restricted to graphs satisfying suitable connectivity conditions,
both of these problems are equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges we
must double in a 2-edge-connected graph in order to obtain a 4-edge-connected
graph. Using this, we show that all these three problems are NP-hard.
  Finally, we consider the operation of deorienting an arc $uv$ of a digraph
$D$ meaning replacing it by an undirected edge between the same vertices. In
terms of connectivity properties, this is equivalent to adding the opposite arc
$vu$ to $D$. We prove that for every $\ell\geq 3$ it is NP-hard to find the
minimum number of arcs to deorient in a digraph $D$ in order to obtain an
$\ell$-strong digraph $D'$.

					<dc:description>  Robotic avatar systems promise to bridge distances and reduce the need for
travel. We present the updated NimbRo avatar system, winner of the $5M grand
prize at the international ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition, which required
participants to build intuitive and immersive telepresence robots that could be
operated by briefly trained operators. We describe key improvements for the
finals compared to the system used in the semifinals: To operate without a
power- and communications tether, we integrate a battery and a robust redundant
wireless communication system. Video and audio data are compressed using
low-latency HEVC and Opus codecs. We propose a new locomotion control device
with tunable resistance force. To increase flexibility, the robot's upper-body
height can be adjusted by the operator. We describe essential monitoring and
robustness tools which enabled the success at the competition. Finally, we
analyze our performance at the competition finals and discuss lessons learned.

					<dc:description>  The enhanced activity typical of the core of Seyfert galaxies can drive
powerful winds where high-energy phenomena can occur. In spite of their high
power content, the number of such non-jetted active galactic nuclei detected in
gamma-ray is very limited. In this Letter, we report the detection of a
gamma-ray flux from NGC 4151, a Seyfert galaxy located at about 15.8 Mpc. The
source is known for hosting ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in its innermost core
through X-ray spectroscopic observations, thereby becoming the first UFO host
ever detected in gamma rays. UFOs are mildly relativistic, wide opening angle
winds detected in the innermost parsecs of active galaxies where strong shocks
can develop. We interpret the gamma-ray flux as a result of diffusive shock
acceleration at the wind termination shock of the UFO and inelastic hadronic
collisions in its environment. Interestingly, NGC 4151 is also spatially
coincident with a weak excess of neutrino events identified by the IceCube
neutrino observatory. We discuss the contribution of the UFO to such a neutrino
excess.

					<dc:description>  Fairness in machine learning has attracted increasing attention in recent
years. The fairness methods improving algorithmic fairness for in-distribution
data may not perform well under distribution shift. In this paper, we first
theoretically demonstrate the inherent connection between distribution shift,
data perturbation, and weight perturbation. Subsequently, we analyze the
sufficient conditions to guarantee fairness (i.e., low demographic parity) for
the target dataset, including fairness for the source dataset, and low
prediction difference between the source and target dataset for each sensitive
attribute group. Motivated by these sufficient conditions, we propose robust
fairness regularization (RFR) by considering the worst case within the weight
perturbation ball for each sensitive attribute group. In this way, the
maximization problem can be simplified as two forward and two backward
propagations for each update of model parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness
of our proposed RFR algorithm on synthetic and real distribution shifts across
various datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RFR achieves better
fairness-accuracy trade-off performance compared with several baselines.

					<dc:description>  Gait recognition is a rapidly advancing vision technique for person
identification from a distance. Prior studies predominantly employed relatively
small and shallow neural networks to extract subtle gait features, achieving
impressive successes in indoor settings. Nevertheless, experiments revealed
that these existing methods mostly produce unsatisfactory results when applied
to newly released in-the-wild gait datasets. This paper presents a unified
perspective to explore how to construct deep models for state-of-the-art
outdoor gait recognition, including the classical CNN-based and emerging
Transformer-based architectures. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of
suitable network capacity, explicit temporal modeling, and deep transformer
structure for discriminative gait representation learning. Our proposed
CNN-based DeepGaitV2 series and Transformer-based SwinGait series exhibit
significant performance gains in outdoor scenarios, \textit{e.g.}, about +30\%
rank-1 accuracy compared with many state-of-the-art methods on the challenging
GREW dataset. This work is expected to further boost the research and
application of gait recognition. Code will be available at
https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.

					<dc:description>  We prove the existence of steady \emph{space quasi-periodic} stream
functions, solutions for the Euler equation in vorticity-stream function
formulation in the two dimensional channel ${\mathbb R}\times [-1,1]$. These
solutions bifurcate from a prescribed shear equilibrium near the Couette flow,
whose profile induces finitely many modes of oscillations in the horizontal
direction for the linearized problem. Using a Nash-Moser implicit function
iterative scheme, near such equilibrium we construct small amplitude, space
reversible stream functions slightly deforming the linear solutions and
retaining the horizontal quasi-periodic structure. These solutions exist for
most values of the parameters characterizing the shear equilibrium. As a
by-product, the streamlines of the nonlinear flow exhibit Kelvin's cat eye-like
trajectories arising from the finitely many stagnation lines of the shear
equilibrium.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a mean field model of social behavior where there
are an infinite number of players, each of whom observes a type privately that
represents her preference, and publicly observes a mean field state of types
and actions of the players in the society. The types (and equivalently
preferences) of the players are dynamically evolving. Each player is fully
rational and forward-looking and makes a decision in each round t to buy a
product. She receives a higher utility if the product she bought is aligned
with her current preference and if there is a higher fraction of people who
bought that product (thus a game of strategic complementarity). We show that
for certain parameters when the weight of strategic complementarity is high,
players eventually herd towards one of the actions with probability 1 which is
when each player buys a product irrespective of her preference.

first author. To do this, we exploit a theorem of the second author and Livesey
that a RoCK block $\mathcal B^{\rho,d}$ is Morita superequivalent to a wreath
superproduct of a certain quiver (super)algebra with the symmetric group
$\mathfrak S_d$. We develop the representation theory of this wreath
superproduct to compute its Cartan invariants. We then directly construct
projective characters for $\mathcal B^{\rho,d}$ to calculate its decomposition
matrix up to a triangular adjustment, and show that this adjustment is trivial
by comparing Cartan invariants.

					<dc:description>  We argue that strain engineering is a powerful tool which may facilitate the
experimental realization and control of topological phases in laser-driven 2D
ferromagnetic systems. To this extent, we show that by applying a circularly
polarized laser field to a 2D honeycomb ferromagnet which is uniaxially
strained in either the zig-zag or armchair direction, it is possible to
generate a synthetic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) tunable by the
intensity of the applied electric field, as well as by the magnitude of applied
strain. Such deformations enable transitions to phases with opposite sign of
Chern number, or to trivial phases. These are basic results that could pave the
way for the development of a new field of Strain Engineered Topological
Spintronics (SETS).

					<dc:description>  In this sequence of work we investigate polynomial equations of additive
functions. We consider the solutions of equation \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x^{p_{i}})g_{i}(x)^{q_{i}}= 0
  \qquad
  \left(x\in \mathbb{F}\right), \] where $n$ is a positive integer,
$\mathbb{F}\subset \mathbb{C}$ is a field, $f_{i}, g_{i}\colon \mathbb{F}\to
\mathbb{C}$ are additive functions and $p_i, q_i$ are positive integers for all
$i=1, \ldots, n$. Using the theory of decomposable functions we describe the
solutions as compositions of higher order derivations and field homomorphisms.
In many cases we also give a tight upper bound for the order of the involved
derivations. Moreover, we present the full description of the solutions in some
important special cases, too.

					<dc:description>  Self-supervised Learning (SSL) provides a strategy for constructing useful
representations of images without relying on hand-assigned labels. Many such
methods aim to map distinct views of the same scene or object to nearby points
in the representation space, while employing some constraint to prevent
representational collapse. Here we recast the problem in terms of efficient
coding by adopting manifold capacity, a measure that quantifies the quality of
a representation based on the number of linearly separable object manifolds it
can support, as the efficiency metric to optimize. Specifically, we adapt the
manifold capacity for use as an objective function in a contrastive learning
framework, yielding a Maximum Manifold Capacity Representation (MMCR). We apply
this method to unlabeled images, each augmented by a set of basic
transformations, and find that it learns meaningful features using the standard
linear evaluation protocol. Specifically, we find that MMCRs support
performance on object recognition comparable to or surpassing that of recently
developed SSL frameworks, while providing more robustness to adversarial
attacks. Empirical analyses reveal differences between MMCRs and
representations learned by other SSL frameworks, and suggest a mechanism by
which manifold compression gives rise to class separability.

					<dc:description>  We compute the Schwartzman group associated with an ergodic affine
automorphism of a compact connected abelian group given by the composition of
an automorphism of the group and a translation by an element in the path
component of the identity. We show that the Schwartzman group can be
characterized by evaluating the invariant characters of the automorphism at the
group element by which one translates. As a byproduct, we show that the set of
labels associated with the doubling map on the dyadic solenoid is trivial,
which in turn allows us to show that any ergodic family of Jacobi matrices
defined over the doubling map has connected almost-sure essential spectrum.

					<dc:description>  We present a microscopic model, describing current-driven switching in
metallic atomic-size contacts. Applying a high current through an atomic-size
contact, creates a strong electronic nonequilibrium that excites vibrational
modes by virtue of the electron-vibration coupling. Using density functional
theory (DFT) in combination with the Landauer-B\&quot;uttiker theory for
phase-coherent transport, expressed in terms of nonequilibrium Green's
functions (NEGFs), we study the current-induced forces arising from this
nonequilibrium and determine those vibrational modes which couple most strongly
to the electronic system. For single-atom lead (Pb) contacts we show specific
candidates for bistable switches, consisting of two similar atomic
configurations with differing electric conductance. We identify vibrational
modes that induce a transition between these configurations. Our results reveal
a possible origin of bistable switching in atomic-size contacts through
excitation of vibrations by inelastic electron scattering and underline the
power of the combined DFT-NEGF approach and statistical mechanics analysis of a
Langevin equation to overcome the time-scale gap between atomic motion and rare
switching events, allowing for an efficient exploration of the contacts'
configurational phase space.

					<dc:description>  Quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique for the
investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum
field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on
the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be
solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum
machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of
strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of
non-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay'
which are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary
particles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator
to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal
field. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of
mesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising
domain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum
chromodynamics. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the
NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques
such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space
methods for analyzing QFTs.

					<dc:description>  The focussing anisotropic nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equation \begin{align*}
\mathrm{i} u_t-\partial_{xx} u + (-\partial_{yy})^s u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad
\mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^2 \end{align*} is considered for
$0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $p&gt;2$. Here the equation is of anisotropy, it means that dispersion
of solutions along $x$-axis and $y$-axis is different. We show that while
localized time-periodic waves, that are solutions in the form $u=e^{-\mathrm{i}
\omega t} \phi$, do not exist in the regime $p\geq p_s:=\frac{2(1+s)}{1-s}$,
they do exist in the complementary regime $2&lt;p&lt;p_s$. In fact, we construct them
variationally and we establish a number of key properties. Importantly, we
completely characterize their spectral stability properties. Our consideration
are easily extendable to the higher dimensional situation. We also show
uniqueness of these waves under a natural weak non-degeneracy assumption. This
assumption is actually removed for $s$ close to $1$, implying uniqueness for
the waves in the full range of parameters.

					<dc:description>  We present the Rubin Observatory system for data storage/retrieval and
pipelined code execution. The layer for data storage and retrieval is named the
Butler. It consists of a relational database, known as the registry, to keep
track of metadata and relations, and a system to manage where the data is
located, named the datastore. Together these systems create an abstraction
layer that science algorithms can be written against. This abstraction layer
manages the complexities of the large data volumes expected and allows
algorithms to be written independently, yet be tied together automatically into
a coherent processing pipeline. This system consists of tools which execute
these pipelines by transforming them into execution graphs which contain
concrete data stored in the Butler. The pipeline infrastructure is designed to
be scalable in nature, allowing execution on environments ranging from a laptop
all the way up to multi-facility data centers. This presentation will focus on
the data management aspects as well as an overview on the creation of pipelines
and the corresponding execution graphs.

equations, relative to that for the well-known bisection method. We show that
there is a minimal effort algorithm that uses more sections than the bisection
method, although this optimal algorithm is problem dependent. The number of

					<dc:description>  We introduce a method that simultaneously learns to explore new large
environments and to reconstruct them in 3D from color images only. This is
closely related to the Next Best View problem (NBV), where one has to identify
where to move the camera next to improve the coverage of an unknown scene.
However, most of the current NBV methods rely on depth sensors, need 3D
supervision and/or do not scale to large scenes. Our method requires only a
color camera and no 3D supervision. It simultaneously learns in a
self-supervised fashion to predict a &quot;volume occupancy field&quot; from color images
and, from this field, to predict the NBV. Thanks to this approach, our method
performs well on new scenes as it is not biased towards any training 3D data.
We demonstrate this on a recent dataset made of various 3D scenes and show it
performs even better than recent methods requiring a depth sensor, which is not
a realistic assumption for outdoor scenes captured with a flying drone.

					<dc:description>  Core-collapse supernovae are a promising potential high-energy neutrino
source class. We test for correlation between seven years of IceCube neutrino
data and a catalog containing more than 1000 core-collapse supernovae of types
IIn and IIP and a sample of stripped-envelope supernovae. We search both for
neutrino emission from individual supernovae, and for combined emission from
the whole supernova sample through a stacking analysis. No significant spatial
or temporal correlation of neutrinos with the cataloged supernovae was found.
The overall deviation of all tested scenarios from the background expectation
yields a p-value of 93% which is fully compatible with background. The derived
upper limits on the total energy emitted in neutrinos are $1.7\times 10^{48}$
erg for stripped-envelope supernovae, $2.8\times 10^{48}$ erg for type IIP, and
$1.3\times 10^{49}$ erg for type IIn SNe, the latter disfavouring models with
optimistic assumptions for neutrino production in interacting supernovae. We
conclude that strippe-envelope supernovae and supernovae of type IIn do not
contribute more than $14.6\%$ and $33.9\%$ respectively to the diffuse neutrino
flux in the energy range of about $10^3-10^5$ GeV, assuming that the neutrino
energy spectrum follows a power-law with an index of $-2.5$. Under the same
assumption, we can only constrain the contribution of type IIP SNe to no more
than $59.9\%$. Thus core-collapse supernovae of types IIn and stripped-envelope
supernovae can both be ruled out as the dominant source of the diffuse neutrino
flux under the given assumptions.

					<dc:description>  The zero-bias anomaly in conductance spectra of single Co atoms on Cu(111)
observed at $\approx$ 4 K, which has been interpreted as being due to a Kondo
resonance, is strongly modified when the Co atoms are attached to monatomic Cu
chains. Scanning tunneling spectra measured at 340 mK in magnetic fields
exhibit all characteristics of spin-flip excitations. Their dependence on the
magnetic field reveals a magnetic anisotropy and suggests a non-collinear spin
state. This indicates that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which has so far been
neglected in theoretical studies of Co/Cu(111), has to be taken into account.
According to our density functional theory and multi-orbital quantum Monte
Carlo calculations SOC suppresses the Kondo effect for all studied geometries.

					<dc:description>  Organic scintillators exhibit fast timing, high detection efficiency for fast
neutrons and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) capability. PSD is essential in
mixed radiation fields, where different types of radiation need to be detected
and discriminated. In neutron measurements for nuclear security and non
proliferation effective PSD is crucial, because a weak neutron signature needs
to be detected in the presence of a strong gamma-ray background. The most
commonly used deterministic PSD technique is charge integration (CI). This
method requires the optimization of specific parameters to obtain the best
gamma-neutron separation. These parameters depend on the scintillating material
and light readout device and typically require a lengthy optimization process
and a calibration reference measurement with a mixed source. In this paper, we
propose a new method based on the scintillation fluorescence physics that
enables to find the optimum PSD integration gates using only a gamma-ray
emitter. We demonstrate our method using three organic scintillation detectors:
deuterated trans-stilbene, small-molecule organic glass, and EJ-309. In all the
investigated cases, our method allowed finding the optimum PSD CI parameters
without the need of iterative optimization.

					<dc:description>  We present a quantum algorithm for sampling an edge on a path between two
nodes s and t in an undirected graph given as an adjacency matrix, and show
that this can be done in query complexity that is asymptotically the same, up
to log factors, as the query complexity of detecting a path between s and t. We
use this path sampling algorithm as a subroutine for st-path finding and
st-cut-set finding algorithms in some specific cases. Our main technical
contribution is an algorithm for generating a quantum state that is
proportional to the positive witness vector of a span program.

					<dc:description>  In a federated learning (FL) system, malicious participants can easily embed
backdoors into the aggregated model while maintaining the model's performance
on the main task. To this end, various defenses, including training stage
aggregation-based defenses and post-training mitigation defenses, have been
proposed recently. While these defenses obtain reasonable performance against
existing backdoor attacks, which are mainly heuristics based, we show that they
are insufficient in the face of more advanced attacks. In particular, we
propose a general reinforcement learning-based backdoor attack framework where
the attacker first trains a (non-myopic) attack policy using a simulator built
upon its local data and common knowledge on the FL system, which is then
applied during actual FL training. Our attack framework is both adaptive and
flexible and achieves strong attack performance and durability even under
state-of-the-art defenses.

					<dc:description>  As the volume of data on the web grows, the web structure graph, which is a
graph representation of the web, continues to evolve. The structure of this
graph has gradually shifted from content-based to non-content-based.
Furthermore, spam data, such as noisy hyperlinks, in the web structure graph
adversely affect the speed and efficiency of information retrieval and link
mining algorithms. Previous works in this area have focused on removing noisy
hyperlinks using structural and string approaches. However, these approaches
may incorrectly remove useful links or be unable to detect noisy hyperlinks in
certain circumstances. In this paper, a data collection of hyperlinks is
initially constructed using an interactive crawler. The semantic and
relatedness structure of the hyperlinks is then studied through semantic web
approaches and tools such as the DBpedia ontology. Finally, the removal process
of noisy hyperlinks is carried out using a reasoner on the DBpedia ontology.
Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and ability of semantic web
technologies to remove noisy hyperlinks

					<dc:description>  We analytically study the impact of a (possibly, very intense) short laser
pulse onto a cold diluted plasma at rest. Choosing the $\vec{z}$-axis in the
propagation direction, if the pulse profile and the initial plasma density
(IPD) depend only on $z$, then suitable matched bounds on the maximum and the
relative variations of the IPD, as well as the intensity and duration of the
pulse, ensure a strictly hydrodynamic evolution of the electron fluid during
its whole interaction with the pulse, while ions can be regarded as immobile.
This evolution is ruled by a family (parametrized by $Z\ge 0$) of decoupled
systems of non-autonomous Hamilton equations with 1 degree of freedom, which
determine how electrons initially located in the layer $Z\le z&lt;Z+dZ$ move;
$\xi=ct-z$ replaces time $t$ as the independent variable. This family of ODEs
is obtained by reduction from the Lorentz-Maxwell and continuity PDEs for the
electrons' fluid within the spacetime region where depletion of the pulse is
negligible. After the laser-plasma interaction the Jacobian of the map from
Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates is &quot;linear-quasi-periodic&quot; in $\xi$. We
determine spacetime locations and features of the first wave-breakings of the
wakefield plasma wave (PW), the motion of test electrons (self-)injected in the
PW. The energy of those trapped in a single PW trough grows linearly with the
distance gone; in our model such electrons cannot dephase, as the PW has phase
velocity $c$. If the impacting laser pulse is symmetric around the
$\vec{z}$-axis and has a not too small radius $R$, the same conclusions hold
for the part of the plasma close to $\vec{z}$ and enclosed within the causal
cone swept by the pulse. This computationally light approach may help in a
preliminary study of extreme acceleration mechanisms of electrons, before 2D or
3D PIC simulations.

					<dc:description>  Multimodal contrastive pretraining has been utilized to train multimodal
representation models, like CLIP, on vast amounts of paired image-text data.
However, previous studies have highlighted the susceptibility of such models to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, when training on backdoored examples, CLIP
learns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the
target label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space. With
injecting only a few poisoned examples e.g., 75 examples in the 3M pretraining
data, the model's behavior can be significantly manipulated, thus making it
hard to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this issue, we propose
CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious
associations introduced by backdoor attacks by re-aligning the representations
for individual modalities independently. CleanCLIP can be employed for both
unsupervised finetuning on paired image-text data and for supervised finetuning
on labeled image data. We demonstrate that unsupervised finetuning with a
combination of multimodal contrastive and unimodal self-supervised objectives
for individual modalities can significantly reduce the impact of the backdoor
attack. Additionally, supervised finetuning on task-specific labeled data of
the individual modality, such as image data, removes the backdoor trigger from
the CLIP vision encoder. Empirically, we show that CleanCLIP maintains model
performance on benign examples while mitigating the impact of a range of
backdoor attacks on multimodal contrastive learning.

					<dc:description>  Recent advances in digitization has led to availability of multivariate time
series data in various domains, in order to monitor operations in real time.
Identifying abnormal data pattern and detect potential failures in these
scenarios are important yet rather difficult tasks. We propose a novel
unsupervised anomaly detection method for time series data. Our approach uses
sequence encoder and decoder to represent the mapping between time series and
hidden state, and learns bidirectional dynamics simultaneously by leveraging
backward and forward temporal information in the training process. We further
regularize the state space to place constraints on states of normal samples,
and use Mahalanobis distance to evaluate abnormality level. Results on
synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed method.

					<dc:description>  This paper gives a complete geometric characterization in all dimensions and

largest possible range of local $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ inequalities permitted by
quadratic-type scaling. The necessary and sufficient curvature-type criterion
is phrased in terms of an associated Newton-like diagram. In the case of
averages over families of polynomial graphs, the curvature condition implies
sharp endpoint estimates as well. The proof relies on the recently-developed

differential inequalities for polynomials first appearing in work on the
Oberlin affine curvature condition.

					<dc:description>  The growing number of devices using the wireless spectrum makes it important
to find ways to minimize interference and optimize the use of the spectrum.
Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been
widely utilized to identify, classify, or mitigate interference due to their
ability to learn from the data directly. However, there have been limited
research on the complexity of such deep learning models. The major focus of
deep learning-based wireless classification literature has been on improving
classification accuracy, often at the expense of model complexity. This may not
be practical for many wireless devices, such as, internet of things (IoT)
devices, which usually have very limited computational resources and cannot
handle very complex models. Thus, it becomes important to account for model
complexity when designing deep learning-based models for interference
classification. To address this, we conduct an analysis of CNN based wireless
classification that explores the trade-off amongst dataset size, CNN model
complexity, and classification accuracy under various levels of classification
difficulty: namely, interference classification, heterogeneous transmitter
classification, and homogeneous transmitter classification. Our study, based on
three wireless datasets, shows that a simpler CNN model with fewer parameters
can perform just as well as a more complex model, providing important insights
into the use of CNNs in computationally constrained applications.

					<dc:title>Lower Bounds for $\gamma$-Regret via the Decision-Estimation Coefficient</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this note, we give a new lower bound for the $\gamma$-regret in bandit
problems, the regret which arises when comparing against a benchmark that is
$\gamma$ times the optimal solution, i.e., $\mathsf{Reg}_{\gamma}(T) = \sum_{t
= 1}^T \gamma \max_{\pi} f(\pi) - f(\pi_t)$. The $\gamma$-regret arises in
structured bandit problems where finding an exact optimum of $f$ is
intractable. Our lower bound is given in terms of a modification of the
constrained Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) of~\citet{foster2023tight}
(and closely related to the original offset DEC of
\citet{foster2021statistical}), which we term the $\gamma$-DEC. When restricted
to the traditional regret setting where $\gamma = 1$, our result removes the
logarithmic factors in the lower bound of \citet{foster2023tight}.

					<dc:description>  CUSP is a powerful formalism that recovers, from first principles and with no
free parameter, all the macroscopic properties of dark matter haloes found in
cosmological N-body simulations and unveils the origin of their characteristic
features. Since it is not restricted by the limitations of simulations, it
covers the whole mass and redshift ranges. In the present Paper we use CUSP to
calculate the mass-scale relations holding for halo density profiles fitted to
the usual NFW and Einasto functions in the most relevant cosmologies and for
the most usual mass definitions. We clarify the origin of these relations and
provide accurate analytic expressions holding for all masses and redshifts. The
performance of those expressions is compared to that of previous models and to
the mass-concentration relation spanning more than 20 orders of magnitude in
mass at $z=0$ obtained in recent simulations of a 100 GeV WIMP universe.

					<dc:description>  In the last decade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, the
introduction of deep learning brought considerable reductions in word error
rate of more than 50% relative, compared to modeling without deep learning. In
the wake of this transition, a number of all-neural ASR architectures were
introduced. These so-called end-to-end (E2E) models provide highly integrated,
completely neural ASR models, which rely strongly on general machine learning
knowledge, learn more consistently from data, while depending less on ASR
domain-specific experience. The success and enthusiastic adoption of deep
learning accompanied by more generic model architectures lead to E2E models now
becoming the prominent ASR approach. The goal of this survey is to provide a
taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements, and to discuss their
properties and their relation to the classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based
ASR architecture. All relevant aspects of E2E ASR are covered in this work:
modeling, training, decoding, and external language model integration,
accompanied by discussions of performance and deployment opportunities, as well
as an outlook into potential future developments.

					<dc:description>  The celebrated Rogers-Ramanujan identities equate the number of integer
partitions of $n$ ($n\in\mathbb N_0$) with parts congruent to $\pm 1 \pmod{5}$
(respectively $\pm 2 \pmod{5}$) and the number of partitions of $n$ with
super-distinct parts (respectively super-distinct parts greater than $1$). In
this paper, we establish companion identities to the Rogers-Ramanujan
identities on the number of parts in all partitions of $n$ of the
aforementioned types, in the spirit of earlier work by Andrews and Beck on a
partition identity of Euler.

					<dc:description>  We study the Jeans gravitational instability for a mixture of baryonic and
dark matter particles, in the post-Newtonian approximation. We adopt a kinetic
model consisting of a coupled system of post-Newtonian collisionless Boltzmann
equations, for each species, coupled to the post-Newtonian Poisson equations.
We derive the stability criterion, accounting for both post-Newtonian
corrections and the presence of dark matter. It is shown that both effects give
rise to smaller Jeans masses, in comparison with the standard Jeans criterion,
meaning that a smaller mass is needed to begin the gravitational collapse.
Taking advantage of that, we confront the model with the observational
stability of Bok globules, and show that the model correctly reproduces the
data.

					<dc:description>  Oxides of $\textit{p}$-block metals ($\textit{e.g.}$, indium oxide) and
semimetals ($\textit{e.g.}$, antimony oxide) are of broad practical interest as
transparent conductors and light absorbers for solar photoconversion due to the
tunability of their electronic conductivity and optical absorption.
Comparatively, these oxides have found limited applications in
solar-to-hydrogen photocatalysis primarily due to their high electronegativity,
which impedes electron transfer for converting protons into molecular hydrogen.
We have shown recently that inserting $\textit{s}$-block metal cations into
$\textit{p}$-block oxides is effective at lowering electronegativities while
affording further control of band gaps. Here, we explain the origins of this
dual tunability by demonstrating the mediator role of $\textit{s}$-block metal
cations in modulating orbital hybridization while not contributing to frontier
electronic states. From this result, we carry out a comprehensive computational
study of 109 ternary oxides of $\textit{s}$- and $\textit{p}$-block metal
elements as candidate photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation. We
downselect the most desirable materials using band gaps and band edges obtained
from Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory with Hubbard parameters
computed entirely from first principles, evaluate the stability of these oxides
in aqueous conditions, and characterize experimentally four of the remaining
materials, synthesized with high phase uniformity, to assess the accuracy of
computational predictions. We thus propose seven oxide semiconductors,
including CsIn$_3$O$_5$, Sr$_2$In$_2$O$_5$, and KSbO$_2$ which, to the extent
of our literature review, have not been previously considered as
water-splitting photocatalysts.

					<dc:description>  Milnor manifolds are a class of certain codimension-$1$ submanifolds of the
product of projective spaces. In this paper, we study the LS-category and
topological complexity of these manifolds. We determine the exact value of the
LS-category and in many cases, the topological complexity of these manifolds.
We also obtain tight bounds on the topological complexity of these manifolds.
It is known that Milnor manifolds admit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and circle actions. We
compute bounds on the equivariant LS-category and equivariant topological
complexity of these manifolds. Finally, we describe the mod-$2$ cohomology
rings of some generalized projective product spaces corresponding to Milnor
manifolds and use this information to compute the bound on LS-category and
topological complexity of these spaces.

					<dc:title>Multi-User Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks Using Multipath

					<dc:creator>Sutcliffe, Evan</dc:creator>
					<dc:creator>Beghelli, Alejandra</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Quantum networks facilitate numerous applications such as secure
communication and distributed quantum computation by performing entanglement
distribution. Multi-user quantum applications where quantum information is
shared between multiple users require access to a shared multipartite state
between the users. We consider the problem of designing protocols for
distributing such states, at an increased entanglement rate.
  We propose three protocols that increase the entanglement rate of multi-user
applications by leveraging multipath routing. The protocols are evaluated on
quantum networks with NISQ constraints, including limited quantum memories and
probabilistic entanglement generation. Monte Carlo simulation results show that
the developed protocols achieve an exponential speedup of entanglement rate
compared to single-path routing techniques, with a maximum speedup of four
orders of magnitude for the cases studied. The speedup was also found to
improve for larger sets of users. When the protocols were tested in scaled-down
real-world topologies, it was found that topology can have a significant effect
on the achievable entanglement rates, with one order of magnitude difference
between topologies. Finally, we find that the benefits of multipath routing are
a maximum for short quantum memory decoherence times, and intermediate values
of entanglement generation probability. Hence the protocols developed can
benefit NISQ quantum network control and design.

					<dc:title>Overstatement-Net-Equivalent Risk-Limiting Audit: ONEAudit</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Stark, Philip B.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Statistics - Applications</dc:subject>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Card-level comparison risk-limiting audits (CLCAs) heretofore required a CVR
for each cast card and a &quot;link&quot; identifying which CVR is for which card --
which many voting systems cannot provide. Every set of CVRs that produces the
same aggregate results overstates contest margins by the same amount: they are
overstatement-net-equivalent (ONE). CLCAs can therefore use CVRs from the
voting system for any number of cards and ONE CVRs for the rest. Ballot-polling
RLAs are equivalent to CLCAs using ONE CVRs. CLCAs can be based on batch-level
results (e.g., precinct subtotals) by constructing ONE CVRs for each batch. In
contrast to batch-level comparison audits (BLCAs), this avoids tabulating
batches manually and works even when reporting batches do not correspond to
physically identifiable batches of cards. If the voting system can export
linked CVRs for only some ballot cards, auditors can still use CLCA by
constructing ONE CVRs for the rest of the cards from contest results or batch
subtotals. This obviates the need for &quot;hybrid&quot; audits. This works for every
social choice function for which there is a known RLA method, including IRV.
Sample sizes for BPA and ONEAudit using contest totals are comparable. ONEAudit
using batch subtotals has smaller sample sizes than ballot-polling when batches
are much more homogeneous than the election overall. Sample sizes can be much
smaller than for BLCA: A CLCA of the 2022 presidential election in California
at risk limit 5% using ONE CVRs for precinct-level results would sample ~70
ballots statewide, if the reported results are accurate, compared to about
26,700 for BLCA. The 2022 Georgia audit tabulated &gt;231,000 cards versus ~1300
for ONEAudit. For data from a pilot hybrid RLA in Kalamazoo, MI, in 2018,
ONEAudit gives a risk of ~2%, substantially lower than the 3.7% measured risk
for SUITE, the method the pilot used.

					<dc:title>Informed Guided Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees*-Connect for Path
  Planning of Walking Robots</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Belter, Dominik</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  In this paper, we deal with the problem of full-body path planning for
walking robots. The state of walking robots is defined in multi-dimensional
space. Path planning requires defining the path of the feet and the robot's
body. Moreover, the planner should check multiple constraints like static
stability, self-collisions, collisions with the terrain, and the legs'
workspace. As a result, checking the feasibility of the potential path is
time-consuming and influences the performance of a planning method. In this
paper, we verify the feasibility of sampling-based planners in the path
planning task of walking robots. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of
the existing planners. Finally, we propose a new planning method that improves
the performance of path planning of legged robots.

					<dc:description>  Fusion products of finite-dimensional cyclic modules, that were defined in
\cite{FL}, form an important class of graded representations of current Lie
algebras. In \cite{cv15}, a family of finite-dimensional indecomposable graded
representations of the current Lie algebra called the Chari-Venkatesh(CV)
modules, were introduced via generators and relations, and it was shown that
these modules are related to fusion products. In this paper, we study a class
of these modules for current Lie algebras of type $A_2$. By constructing a
series of short exact sequences, we obtain a graded decomposition for them and
show that they are isomorphic to fusion products of two finite-dimensional
irreducible modules for current Lie algebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$. Further,
using the graded character of these CV-modules, we obtain an algebraic
characterization of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients that appear in the
decomposition of tensor products of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb
C)$-modules.

					<dc:description>  Nowadays, embedded systems are provided with cache memories that are large
enough to influence in both performance and energy consumption as never
occurred before in this kind of systems. In addition, the cache memory system
has been identified as a component that improves those metrics by adapting its
configuration according to the memory access patterns of the applications being
run. However, given that cache memories have many parameters which may be set
to a high number of different values, designers face to a wide and
time-consuming exploration space. In this paper we propose an optimization
framework based on Grammatical Evolution (GE) which is able to efficiently find
the best cache configurations for a given set of benchmark applications. This
metaheuristic allows an important reduction of the optimization runtime
obtaining good results in a low number of generations. Besides, this reduction
is also increased due to the efficient storage of evaluated caches. Moreover,
we selected GE because the plasticity of the grammar eases the creation of
phenotypes that form the call to the cache simulator required for the
evaluation of the different configurations. Experimental results for the
Mediabench suite show that our proposal is able to find cache configurations
that obtain an average improvement of $62\%$ versus a real world baseline
configuration.

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing complex
robotic challenges. In real-world applications, RL is often accompanied by
failsafe controllers as a last resort to avoid catastrophic events. While
necessary for safety, these interventions can result in undesirable behaviors,
such as abrupt braking or aggressive steering. This paper proposes two safety
intervention reduction methods: action replacement and projection, which change
the agent's action if it leads to an unsafe state. These approaches are
compared to the state-of-the-art constrained RL on the OpenAI safety gym
benchmark and a human-robot collaboration task. Our study demonstrates that the
combination of our method with provably safe RL leads to high-performing
policies with zero safety violations and a low number of failsafe
interventions. Our versatile method can be applied to a wide range of
real-world robotics tasks, while effectively improving safety without
sacrificing task performance.

					<dc:title>Symbolic Synthesis of Neural Networks</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Whitehouse, Eli</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Computer Science - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Neural networks adapt very well to distributed and continuous
representations, but struggle to learn and generalize from small amounts of
data. Symbolic systems commonly achieve data efficient generalization by
exploiting modularity to benefit from local and discrete features of a
representation. These features allow symbolic programs to be improved one
module at a time and to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can
successfully process. However, it is difficult to design components that can be
used to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like
neural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules
unstable. I present Graph-based Symbolically Synthesized Neural Networks
(G-SSNNs), a form of neural network whose topology and parameters are informed
by the output of a symbolic program. I demonstrate that by developing symbolic
abstractions at a population level, and applying gradient-based optimization to
such neural models at an individual level, I can elicit reliable patterns of
improved generalization with small quantities of data known to contain local
and discrete features. The paradigm embodied by G-SSNNs offers a route towards
the communal development of compact and composable abstractions which can be
flexibly repurposed for a variety of tasks and high-dimensional media. In
future work, I hope to pursue these benefits by exploring more ambitious G-SSNN
designs based on more complex classes of symbolic programs. The code and data
associated with the reported results are publicly available at
https://github.com/shlomenu/symbolically_synthesized_networks .

					<dc:description>  Fingerprint-based identification systems achieve higher accuracy when a slap
containing multiple fingerprints of a subject is used instead of a single
fingerprint. However, segmenting or auto-localizing all fingerprints in a slap
image is a challenging task due to the different orientations of fingerprints,
noisy backgrounds, and the smaller size of fingertip components. The presence
of slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are
rotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and
label the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and
finger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we
introduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep
learning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from
both axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images. We built a fingerprint
segmentation model named CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation
Model) by updating the previously proposed CFSEG model which was based on
traditional Faster R-CNN architecture [21]. CRFSEG improves upon the Faster
R-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to
perform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm
on a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children
subjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across
different age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully. In
the Combined dataset containing both normal and rotated images of adult and
children subjects, we achieved a matching accuracy of 97.17%, which
outperformed state-of-the-art VeriFinger (94.25%) and NFSEG segmentation
systems (80.58%).

					<dc:description>  The response of Newtonian liquids to small perturbations is usually
considered to be fully described by homogeneous transport coefficients like
shear and dilatational viscosity. However, the presence of strong density
gradients at the liquid/vapor boundary of fluids hints at the possible
existence of an inhomogeneous viscosity. Here, we show that a surface viscosity
emerges from the collective dynamics of interfacial layers in molecular
simulations of simple liquids. We estimate the surface viscosity to be 8-16
times smaller than that of the bulk fluid at the thermodynamic point
considered. This result can have important implications for reactions at liquid
surfaces in atmospheric chemistry and catalysis.

					<dc:description>  Fundamental to all living organisms and living soft matter are emergent
processes in which the reorganization of individual constituents at the
nanoscale drives group-level movements and shape changes at the macroscale over
time. However, light-induced degradation of fluorophores, photobleaching, is a
significant problem in extended live cell imaging in life science, and
excellent prior arts of STED, MINSTED, or MINFLUX intentionally apply
photobleaching optics for super-resolution, yet lack extended live-cell imaging
capability as fluorophores reach an irreversible photobleaching limit. Here, we
report an innovative way of opening a long-time investigation window of living
matter by a nonbleaching phase intensity nanoscope: PINE. We accomplish
phase-intensity separation to obtain phase differences between electric field
components, such that nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region are
distinguished from one another by an integrated phase-intensity multilayer thin
film (polyvinyl alcohol/liquid crystal). We obtain distributional patterns of
precisely localized nanoprobes to overcome a physical limit to resolve sub-10
nm cellular architectures, and achieve the first dynamic imaging of nanoscopic
reorganization over 250 hours using nonbleaching PINE. Since PINE allows a
long-time investigation window, we discover nanoscopic rearrangements
synchronized with the emergence of group-level movements and shape changes at
the macroscale according to a set of interaction rules. We believe that PINE
and its application presented here provide a mechanistic understanding of
emergent dynamics important in cellular and soft matter reorganization,
self-organization, and pattern formation.

$(\log N)^{-c\log\log\log N}$, for some constant $c$ that depends only on $k$.
This improves on the best bound in the literature, due to Rice, and generalizes
a recent result of Bloom and Maynard.

					<dc:description>  A Deep Learning (DL) algorithm is built and tested for its ability to
determine centers of star images on HST/WFPC2 exposures, in filters F555W and
F814W. These archival observations hold great potential for proper-motion
studies, but the undersampling in the camera's detectors presents challenges
for conventional centering algorithms. Two exquisite data sets of over 600
exposures of the cluster NGC 104 in these filters are used as a testbed for
training and evaluation of the DL code.
  Results indicate a single-measurement standard error of from 8.5 to 11 mpix,
depending on detector and filter.This compares favorably to the $\sim20$ mpix
achieved with the customary ``effective PSF'' centering procedure for WFPC2
images. Importantly, pixel-phase error is largely eliminated when using the DL
method. The current tests are limited to the central portion of each detector;
in future studies the DL code will be modified to allow for the known variation
of the PSF across the detectors.

					<dc:description>  Superconducting quantum processors comprising flux-tunable data and coupler
qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation. However, magnetic flux
crosstalk between the flux-control lines and the constituent qubits impedes
precision control of qubit frequencies, presenting a challenge to scaling this
platform. In order to implement high-fidelity digital and analog quantum
operations, one must characterize the flux crosstalk and compensate for it. In
this work, we introduce a learning-based calibration protocol and demonstrate
its experimental performance by calibrating an array of 16 flux-tunable
transmon qubits. To demonstrate the extensibility of our protocol, we simulate
the crosstalk matrix learning procedure for larger arrays of transmon qubits.
We observe an empirically linear scaling with system size, while maintaining a
median qubit frequency error below $300$ kHz.

linearly dependent on unknown parameter vectors and with unknown variance.
Specifically, with a Bayesian formulation we consider multivariate normal-gamma
priors to represent environment uncertainty for all involved parameters. We
show that our chosen sampling prior is a conjugate prior to the reward model
and derive a Bayesian regret bound for Thompson sampling under the condition
that the 5/2-moment of the variance distribution exist.

					<dc:description>  The increasing connectivity and intricate remote access environment have made
traditional perimeter-based network defense vulnerable. Zero trust becomes a
promising approach to provide defense policies based on agent-centric trust
evaluation. However, the limited observations of the agent's trace bring
information asymmetry in the decision-making. To facilitate the human
understanding of the policy and the technology adoption, one needs to create a
zero-trust defense that is explainable to humans and adaptable to different
attack scenarios. To this end, we propose a scenario-agnostic zero-trust
defense based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) and
first-order Meta-Learning using only a handful of sample scenarios. The
framework leads to an explainable and generalizable trust-threshold defense
policy. To address the distribution shift between empirical security datasets
and reality, we extend the model to a robust zero-trust defense minimizing the
worst-case loss. We use case studies and real-world attacks to corroborate the
results.

					<dc:description>  The spin-orbit interaction in spin qubits enables spin-flip transitions,
resulting in Rabi oscillations when an external microwave field is resonant
with the qubit frequency. Here, we introduce an alternative driving mechanism
of hole spin qubits, where a far-detuned oscillating field couples to the qubit
phase. Phase driving at radio frequencies, orders of magnitude slower than the
microwave qubit frequency, induces highly non-trivial spin dynamics, violating
the Rabi resonance condition. By using a qubit integrated in a silicon fin
field-effect transistor (Si FinFET), we demonstrate a controllable suppression
of resonant Rabi oscillations, and their revivals at tunable sidebands. These
sidebands enable alternative qubit control schemes using global fields and
local far-detuned pulses, facilitating the design of dense large-scale qubit
architectures with local qubit addressability. Phase driving also decouples
Rabi oscillations from noise, an effect due to a gapped Floquet spectrum and
can enable Floquet engineering high-fidelity gates in future quantum
processors.

					<dc:description>  Modern vertical take-off and landing vehicles (VTOLs) could significantly
affect the future of mobility. The broad range of their application fields
encompasses urban air mobility, transportation and logistics as well as
reconnaissance and observation missions in a military context. This article
presents an efficient numerical framework for dynamic scheduling of multiple
VTOLs. It combines a scheduling problem with optimal trajectory planning. The
whole setting is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel optimization problem. At
the upper level, VTOLs are scheduled, and their starting times are computed.
The solution of the lower level problem involves the computation of a value
function and yields optimal trajectories for every aerial vehicle. In order to
solve the bilevel problem,it is recast into a single-level one. The resulting
mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) is then piecewise linearized and solved
numerically by a linear solver based on the Branch-and-Bound algorithm.
Numerical results prove the feasibility of the approach proposed in this work.

					<dc:title>Kagome and honeycomb flat bands in moir\'e graphene</dc:title>

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We propose a class of graphene-based moir\'e systems hosting flat bands on
kagome and honeycomb moir\'e superlattices. These systems are formed by
stacking a graphene layer on a 2D substrate with lattice constant approximately
$\sqrt{3}$ times that of graphene. When the moir\'e potentials are induced by a
2D irreducible corepresentation in the substrate, the model shows a rich phase
diagram of low energy bands including eigenvalue fragile phases as well as
kagome and honeycomb flat bands. Spin-orbit coupling in the substrate can lift
symmetry protected degeneracies and create spin Chern bands, and we observe
spin Chern numbers up to $3$. We additionally propose a moir\'e system formed
by stacking two graphene-like layers with similar lattice constants but
opposite signs of the Dirac Fermi velocity. This system exhibits multiple
kagome and honeycomb flat bands simultaneously. Both models we propose resemble
the hypermagic model of [Phys. Rev. B 106, 115418] and may provide ideal
platforms for the realization of strongly correlated topological phases.

					<dc:description>  It is shown that any theory that has certain properties has a measurement
problem, in the sense that it makes predictions that are incompatible with
measurement outcomes being absolute (that is, unique and non-relational). These
properties are Bell Nonlocality, Information Preservation, and Local Dynamics.
The result is extended by deriving Local Dynamics from No Superluminal
Influences, Separable Dynamics, and Consistent Embeddings. As well as
explaining why the existing Wigner's-friend-inspired no-go theorems hold for
quantum theory, these results also shed light on whether a future theory of
physics might overcome the measurement problem. In particular, they suggest the
possibility of a theory in which absoluteness is maintained, but without
rejecting relativity theory (as in Bohm theory) or embracing objective
collapses (as in GRW theory).

low densities is constructed by a non-local closure of the BBGKY-hierarchy,
involving pair correlations. We show that the mean-field assumption of
molecular chaos yields unphysical predictions, whereas the scattering theory
shows excellent agreement with agent-based simulations. To extend the theory to
high densities, a self-consistent mapping to a random-telegraph process is
performed. The approach is used to derive a one-particle Langevin-equation and
leads to analytical expressions for the correlations of its effective noise.

					<dc:description>  We investigate and characterize the emergence of finite-component dissipative
phase transitions (DPTs) in nonlinear photon resonators subject to $n$-photon
driving and dissipation. Exploiting a semiclassical approach, we derive general
results on the occurrence of second-order DPTs in this class of systems. We
show that for all odd $n$, no second-order DPT can occur while, for even $n$,
the competition between higher-order nonlinearities determines the nature of
the criticality allowing for second-order DPTs to emerge only for $n=2$ and
$n=4$. As pivotal examples, we study the full quantum dynamics of three- and
four-photon driven-dissipative Kerr resonators, confirming the prediction of
the semiclassical analysis on the nature of the transitions. The stability of
the vacuum and the typical timescales needed to access the different phases are
also discussed. We also show a first-order DPT where multiple solution emerge
around zero, low, and high-photon number. Our results highlight the crucial
role played by $strong$ and $weak$ symmetries in triggering critical behaviors,
providing a Liouvillian framework to study the effect of high-order nonlinear
processes in driven-dissipative systems, that can be applied to problems in
quantum sensing and information processing.

					<dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  It has been predicted that multichannel Kondo lattices undergo a symmetry
breaking at low temperatures. We use the dynamical large-$N$ technique to
ascertain this prediction in a microscopic model on a honeycomb lattice and
find out that it is not generally true. Rather, we find a 2+1D conformally
invariant fixed point, governed by critical exponents that are found
numerically. When we break time-reversal symmetry by adding a Haldane mass to
the conduction elections, three phases, separated by continuous transitions,
are discernible; one characterized by dynamic mass generation and spontaneous
breaking of the channel symmetry, one where topological defects restore channel
symmetry but preserve the gap, and one with a Kondo-coupled chiral spin-liquid.
We argue that the latter phase, is a fractional Chern insulator with anyonic
excitations.

					<dc:description>  We consider a model of Non-Brownian self-propelled particles with
anti-alignment interactions where particles try to avoid each other by
attempting to turn into opposite directions. The particles undergo apparent
Brownian motion, even though the particle's equations are fully deterministic.
We show that the deterministic interactions lead to internal, dynamical noise.
Starting from the N-particle Liouville equation, a kinetic equation for the
one-particle distribution function is obtained. We show that the usual
mean-field assumption of molecular chaos leads to qualitatively wrong
predictions such as an infinite coefficient of self-diffusion. Going beyond
mean-field and applying the refined assumption of ``one-sided molecular
chaos'', we analytically calculate the scattering of particles in the limit of
low density and obtain explicit expressions for the dynamical noise of an
effective one-particle Langevin-equation and the corresponding self-diffusion.
In this calculation, the so-called superposition principle of traditional
kinetic theory was modified to handle a system with non-Hamiltonian dynamics
involving phase-space compression. The predicted theoretical expressions for
the relaxation of hydrodynamic modes and the self-diffusion coefficient are in
excellent, quantitative agreement with agent-based simulations at small density
and small anti-alignment strength. At large particle densities, a given
particle is constantly approached and abandoned by different collision
partners. Modelling this switching of partners by a random telegraph process
and exactly solving a self-consistent integral equation, we obtain explicit
expressions for the noise correlations of the effective one-particle
Langevin-equation. Comparison with agent-based simulation show very good
agreement.

					<dc:description>  We study the Lanczos method for approximating the action of a symmetric
matrix function $f(\mathbf{A})$ on a vector $\mathbf{b}$ (Lanczos-FA). For the
function $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, it is known that the error of Lanczos-FA after $k$
iterations matches the error of the best approximation from the Krylov subspace
of degree $k$ when $\vec{A}$ is positive definite. We prove that the same
holds, up to a multiplicative approximation factor, when $f$ is a rational
function with no poles in the interval containing $\mathbf{A}$'s eigenvalues.
The approximation factor depends the degree of $f$'s denominator and the
condition number of $\mathbf{A}$, but not on the number of iterations $k$.
Experiments confirm that our bound accurately predicts the convergence of
Lanczos-FA. Moreover, we believe that our result provides strong theoretical
justification for the excellent practical performance that has long by observed
of the Lanczos method, both for approximating rational functions and functions
like $\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}\mathbf{b}$ that are well approximated by rationals.

					<dc:description>  In solid materials, nontrivial topological states, electron correlations, and
magnetism are central ingredients for realizing quantum properties, including
unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves, and quantum
spin liquids. The Kagome lattice, made up of connected triangles and hexagons,
can host these three ingredients simultaneously and has proven to be a fertile
platform for studying diverse quantum phenomena including those stemming from
the interplay of these ingredients. In this review, we introduce the
fundamental properties of the Kagome lattice as well as discuss the complex
observed phenomena seen in several emergent material systems such as the
intertwining of charge order and superconductivity in some Kagome metals,
modulation of magnetism and topology in some Kagome magnets, and symmetry
breaking with Mott physics in the breathing Kagome insulators. We also
highlight many open questions in the field as well as future research
directions of Kagome systems.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce Tolerant Discrete Barrier States (T-DBaS), a
novel safety-embedding technique for trajectory optimization with enhanced
exploratory capabilities. The proposed approach generalizes the standard
discrete barrier state (DBaS) method by accommodating temporary constraint
violation during the optimization process while still approximating its safety
guarantees. Consequently, the proposed approach eliminates the DBaS's safe
nominal trajectories assumption, while enhancing its exploration effectiveness
for escaping local minima. Towards applying T-DBaS to safety-critical
autonomous robotics, we combine it with Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP),
leading to the proposed safe trajectory optimization method T-DBaS-DDP, which
inherits the convergence and scalability properties of the solver. The
effectiveness of the T-DBaS algorithm is verified on differential drive robot
and quadrotor simulations. In addition, we compare against the classical
DBaS-DDP as well as Augmented-Lagrangian DDP (AL-DDP) in extensive numerical
comparisons that demonstrate the proposed method's competitive advantages.
Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach is verified through
hardware experiments on the Georgia Tech Robotarium platform.

					<dc:description>  We address efficient and structure-aware 3D scene representation from images.
Nerflets are our key contribution -- a set of local neural radiance fields that
together represent a scene. Each nerflet maintains its own spatial position,
orientation, and extent, within which it contributes to panoptic, density, and
radiance reconstructions. By leveraging only photometric and inferred panoptic
image supervision, we can directly and jointly optimize the parameters of a set
of nerflets so as to form a decomposed representation of the scene, where each
object instance is represented by a group of nerflets. During experiments with
indoor and outdoor environments, we find that nerflets: (1) fit and approximate
the scene more efficiently than traditional global NeRFs, (2) allow the
extraction of panoptic and photometric renderings from arbitrary views, and (3)
enable tasks rare for NeRFs, such as 3D panoptic segmentation and interactive
editing.

					<dc:description>  Activity and property prediction models are the central workhorses in drug
discovery and materials sciences, but currently they have to be trained or
fine-tuned for new tasks. Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language
models could be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and
few-shot capabilities. However, their predictive quality at activity prediction
is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model
that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via
understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose
a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language
inputs, and a contrastive pre-training objective on data from large biochemical
databases. In extensive experiments, we show that our method CLAMP yields
improved predictive performance on few-shot learning benchmarks and zero-shot
problems in drug discovery. We attribute the advances of our method to the
modularized architecture and to our pre-training objective.

					<dc:description>  Motion planning framed as optimisation in structured latent spaces has
recently emerged as competitive with traditional methods in terms of planning
success while significantly outperforming them in terms of computational speed.
However, the real-world applicability of recent work in this domain remains
limited by the need to express obstacle information directly in state-space,
involving simple geometric primitives. In this work we address this challenge
by leveraging learned scene embeddings together with a generative model of the
robot manipulator to drive the optimisation process. In addition, we introduce
an approach for efficient collision checking which directly regularises the
optimisation undertaken for planning. Using simulated as well as real-world
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach, AMP-LS, is able to successfully
plan in novel, complex scenes while outperforming traditional planning
baselines in terms of computation speed by an order of magnitude. We show that
the resulting system is fast enough to enable closed-loop planning in
real-world dynamic scenes.

					<dc:title>Efficient Skill Acquisition for Complex Manipulation Tasks in Obstructed

					<dc:description>  Data efficiency in robotic skill acquisition is crucial for operating robots
in varied small-batch assembly settings. To operate in such environments,
robots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning
acquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however,
fall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a
robot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task
spaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion
planning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but
cannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often
specified by a user or object-specific pose estimator. In this work, we propose
a system for efficient skill acquisition that leverages an object-centric
generative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify a goal for
MP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed
environments. Specifically, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification
and re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the
target object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill
transition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and
feasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy. The experiments
demonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification provides
competitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular
framework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL
algorithm, by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed
environments.

					<dc:description>  Existing referring understanding tasks tend to involve the detection of a
single text-referred object. In this paper, we propose a new and general
referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT).
Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the
prediction of multi-object tracking. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first work to achieve an arbitrary number of referent object predictions in
videos. To push forward RMOT, we construct one benchmark with scalable
expressions based on KITTI, named Refer-KITTI. Specifically, it provides 18
videos with 818 expressions, and each expression in a video is annotated with
an average of 10.7 objects. Further, we develop a transformer-based
architecture TransRMOT to tackle the new task in an online manner, which
achieves impressive detection performance and outperforms other counterparts.

					<dc:description>  AI technologies continue to advance from digital assistants to assisted
decision-making. However, designing AI remains a challenge given its unknown
outcomes and uses. One way to expand AI design is by centering stakeholders in
the design process. We conduct co-design sessions with gig workers to explore
the design of gig worker-centered tools as informed by their driving patterns,
decisions, and personal contexts. Using workers' own data as well as city-level
data, we create probes -- interactive data visuals -- that participants explore
to surface the well-being and positionalities that shape their work strategies.
We describe participant insights and corresponding AI design considerations
surfaced from data probes about: 1) workers' well-being trade-offs and
positionality constraints, 2) factors that impact well-being beyond those in
the data probes, and 3) instances of unfair algorithmic management. We discuss
the implications for designing data probes and using them to elevate
worker-centered AI design as well as for worker advocacy.

					<dc:description>  Given a real variety (that is, a complex manifold equipped with an
anti-holomorphic involution), the Smith-Thom inequality says that the total
$\mathbb{F}_2$-Betti number of the real locus is at most the total
$\mathbb{F}_2$-Betti number of the ambient complex manifold. A real variety is
called maximal (or M-variety) if the equality holds. We give several
constructions of maximal real varieties by taking moduli spaces of certain
objects on a maximal real variety. More precisely, we prove that the following
real varieties are maximal:
  - moduli spaces of stable vector bundles of coprime rank and degree over a
maximal smooth projective real curve (this is Brugall\'e-Schaffhauser's
theorem, but we give a very short new proof); similarly for moduli spaces of
stable parabolic vector bundles;
  - moduli spaces of stable Higgs bundles of coprime rank and degree over a
maximal smooth projective real curve;
  - if a real variety has a non-empty real locus and maximal Hilbert square,
then the variety itself and its Hilbert cube are maximal;
  - punctual Hilbert schemes on a $c_1$-maximal real projective surface with
vanishing first Betti number and 2-torsion free second cohomology (e.g.
$\mathbb{R}$-rational maximal real surfaces);
  - moduli spaces of stable sheaves on a $\mathbb{R}$-rational maximal Poisson
surface (e.g. the real projective plane).
  We also highlight the observation that maximality is a motivic property when
interpreted as equivariant formality, and any smooth projective real variety
that is motivated by maximal ones is maximal.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle two challenges in multimodal learning for visual
recognition: 1) when missing-modality occurs either during training or testing
in real-world situations; and 2) when the computation resources are not
available to finetune on heavy transformer models. To this end, we propose to
utilize prompt learning and mitigate the above two challenges together.
Specifically, our modality-missing-aware prompts can be plugged into multimodal
transformers to handle general missing-modality cases, while only requiring
less than 1% learnable parameters compared to training the entire model. We
further explore the effect of different prompt configurations and analyze the
robustness to missing modality. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the
effectiveness of our prompt learning framework that improves the performance
under various missing-modality cases, while alleviating the requirement of
heavy model re-training. Code is available.

					<dc:description>  The interactions between the spin-$1/2$ doubly charmed baryons and
Nambu-Goldstone bosons are analyzed within a manifestly relativistic baryon
chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-next-to leading order, by using the
so-called extended-on-mass-shell scheme. We utilize heavy diquark-antiquark
symmetry to estimate the low-energy constants in the chiral effective
Lagrangians. The $S$- and $P$-wave scattering lengths are predicted. We find
that those diagrams, vanishing exactly in the heavy-quark limit, do contribute
slightly to the $S$-wave scattering lengths in reality. The influence of the
spin-$3/2$ doubly charmed baryons, as heavy-quark spin partners of the
spin-$1/2$ ones, on the scattering lengths is discussed as well. Finally,
$S$-wave phase shifts for elastic scattering processes are presented in the
energy region near threshold. Our results in this work will not only be very
useful for performing chiral extrapolations of future lattice QCD data, but
also provide us chiral inputs for the investigation of the spectroscopy of
doubly heavy baryons.

					<dc:description>  Following the invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, and EU governments--among
others--sanctioned oligarchs close to Putin. This approach has come under
scrutiny, as evidence has emerged of the oligarchs' successful evasion of these
punishments. To address this problem, we analyze the role of an overlooked but
highly influential group: the secretive professional intermediaries who create
and administer the oligarchs' offshore financial empires. Drawing on the
Offshore Leaks Database provided by the International Consortium of
Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), we examine the ties linking offshore expert
advisors (lawyers, accountants, and other wealth management professionals) to
ultra-high-net-worth individuals from four countries: Russia, China, the United
States, and Hong Kong. We find that resulting nation-level &quot;oligarch networks&quot;
share a scale-free structure characterized by heterogeneity of heavy-tailed
degree distributions of wealth managers; however, network topologies diverge
across clients from democratic versus autocratic regimes. While generally
robust, scale-free networks are fragile when targeted by attacks on
highly-connected nodes. Our &quot;knock-out&quot; experiments pinpoint this vulnerability
to the small group of wealth managers themselves, suggesting that sanctioning
these professional intermediaries may be more effective and efficient in
disrupting dark finance flows than sanctions on their wealthy clients. This
vulnerability is especially pronounced amongst Russian oligarchs, who
concentrate their offshore business in a handful of boutique wealth management
firms. The distinctive patterns we identify suggest a new approach to
sanctions, focused on expert intermediaries to disrupt the finances and
alliances of their wealthy clients. More generally, our research contributes to
the larger body of work on complexity science and the structures of secrecy.

					<dc:description>  Oracle-less machine learning (ML) attacks have broken various logic locking
schemes. Regular synthesis, which is tailored for area-power-delay
optimization, yields netlists where key-gate localities are vulnerable to
learning. Thus, we call for security-aware logic synthesis. We propose ALMOST,
a framework for adversarial learning to mitigate oracle-less ML attacks via
synthesis tuning. ALMOST uses a simulated-annealing-based synthesis recipe
generator, employing adversarially trained models that can predict
state-of-the-art attacks' accuracies over wide ranges of recipes and key-gate
localities. Experiments on ISCAS benchmarks confirm the attacks' accuracies
drops to around 50\% for ALMOST-synthesized circuits, all while not undermining
design optimization.

					<dc:description>  Humans constantly contact objects to move and perform tasks. Thus, detecting
human-object contact is important for building human-centered artificial
intelligence. However, there exists no robust method to detect contact between
the body and the scene from an image, and there exists no dataset to learn such
a detector. We fill this gap with HOT (&quot;Human-Object conTact&quot;), a new dataset
of human-object contacts for images. To build HOT, we use two data sources: (1)
We use the PROX dataset of 3D human meshes moving in 3D scenes, and
automatically annotate 2D image areas for contact via 3D mesh proximity and
projection. (2) We use the V-COCO, HAKE and Watch-n-Patch datasets, and ask
trained annotators to draw polygons for the 2D image areas where contact takes
place. We also annotate the involved body part of the human body. We use our
HOT dataset to train a new contact detector, which takes a single color image
as input, and outputs 2D contact heatmaps as well as the body-part labels that
are in contact. This is a new and challenging task that extends current
foot-ground or hand-object contact detectors to the full generality of the
whole body. The detector uses a part-attention branch to guide contact
estimation through the context of the surrounding body parts and scene. We
evaluate our detector extensively, and quantitative results show that our model
outperforms baselines, and that all components contribute to better
performance. Results on images from an online repository show reasonable
detections and generalizability.

					<dc:description>  Transfer learning and ensembling are two popular techniques for improving the
performance and robustness of neural networks. Due to the high cost of
pre-training, ensembles of models fine-tuned from a single pre-trained
checkpoint are often used in practice. Such models end up in the same basin of
the loss landscape and thus have limited diversity. In this work, we study if
it is possible to improve ensembles trained from a single pre-trained
checkpoint by better exploring the pre-train basin or a close vicinity outside
of it. We show that while exploration of the pre-train basin may be beneficial
for the ensemble, leaving the basin results in losing the benefits of transfer
learning and degradation of the ensemble quality.

					<dc:description>  In this paper, we explore Bell inequality violation for $2\rightarrow2$
scattering in Effective Field Theories (EFTs) of photons, gluons, and
gravitons. Using the CGLMP Bell parameter ($I_2$), we show that, starting from
an appropriate initial non-product state, the Bell inequality can always be
violated in the final state (i.e.,$I_2 &gt;2$) at least for some scattering angle.
For an initial product state, we demonstrate that abelian gauge theories behave
qualitatively differently than non-abelian gauge theories (or Gravity) from the
point of view of Bell violation in the final state: in the non-abelian case,
Bell violation ($I_2&gt;2$) is never possible within the validity of EFTs for
weakly coupled UV completions. Interestingly, we also find that, for a
maximally entangled initial state, scattering can reduce the degree of
entanglement only for CP-violating theories. Thus Bell violation in
$2\rightarrow2$ scattering can, in principle, be used to classify CP conserving
vs violating theories.

					<dc:description>  Open-ended learning methods that automatically generate a curriculum of
increasingly challenging tasks serve as a promising avenue toward generally
capable reinforcement learning agents. Existing methods adapt curricula
independently over either environment parameters (in single-agent settings) or
co-player policies (in multi-agent settings). However, the strengths and
weaknesses of co-players can manifest themselves differently depending on
environmental features. It is thus crucial to consider the dependency between
the environment and co-player when shaping a curriculum in multi-agent domains.
In this work, we use this insight and extend Unsupervised Environment Design
(UED) to multi-agent environments. We then introduce Multi-Agent Environment
Design Strategist for Open-Ended Learning (MAESTRO), the first multi-agent UED
approach for two-player zero-sum settings. MAESTRO efficiently produces
adversarial, joint curricula over both environments and co-players and attains
minimax-regret guarantees at Nash equilibrium. Our experiments show that
MAESTRO outperforms a number of strong baselines on competitive two-player
games, spanning discrete and continuous control settings.

					<dc:description>  Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However,
enabling general inference in the real world, e.g., for robotics problems,
raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to
directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language
models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our
embodied language model are multi-modal sentences that interleave visual,
continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these
encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model,
for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning,
visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a
single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied
reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple
embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from
diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and
visual-language domains. Our largest model, PaLM-E-562B with 562B parameters,
in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist
with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language
capabilities with increasing scale.

					<dc:description>  Subgraph-based graph representation learning (SGRL) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool in many prediction tasks on graphs due to its advantages in model
expressiveness and generalization ability. Most previous SGRL models face
computational issues associated with the high cost of extracting subgraphs for
each training or testing query. Recently, SUREL has been proposed as a new
framework to accelerate SGRL, which samples random walks offline and joins
these walks as subgraphs online for prediction. Due to the reusability of
sampled walks across different queries, SUREL achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scalability and prediction accuracy. However, SUREL still
suffers from high computational overhead caused by node redundancy in sampled
walks. In this work, we propose a novel framework SUREL+ that upgrades SUREL by
using node sets instead of walks to represent subgraphs. This set-based
representation avoids node duplication by definition, but the sizes of node
sets can be irregular. To address this issue, we design a dedicated sparse data
structure to efficiently store and fast index node sets, and provide a
specialized operator to join them in parallel batches. SUREL+ is modularized to
support multiple types of set samplers, structural features, and neural
encoders to complement the loss of structural information due to the reduction
from walks to sets. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate
SUREL+ in the prediction tasks of links, relation types, and higher-order
patterns. SUREL+ achieves 3-11$\times$ speedups of SUREL while maintaining
comparable or even better prediction performance; compared to other SGRL
baselines, SUREL+ achieves $\sim$20$\times$ speedups and significantly improves
the prediction accuracy.

$D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)$ of two displaced thermal states is finite. More

$\sigma$ with inverse temperature parameters $r_1, r_2,\dots, r_n$ and
$s_1,s_2, \dots, s_n$, respectively, we have
  \[
  D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)&lt;\infty \Leftrightarrow \alpha &lt; \min \left\{
\frac{s_j}{s_j-r_j}: j \in \{ 1, \ldots , n \} \text{ such that } r_j&lt;s_j
\right\},
  \]

infinity. Along the way, we prove a special case of a conjecture of
Seshdreesan, Lami and Wilde (J. Math. Phys. 59, 072204 (2018)).

					<dc:description>  We present a sim-to-real learning-based approach for real-world humanoid
locomotion. Our controller is a causal Transformer trained by autoregressive
prediction of future actions from the history of observations and actions. We
hypothesize that the observation-action history contains useful information
about the world that a powerful Transformer model can use to adapt its behavior
in-context, without updating its weights. We do not use state estimation,
dynamics models, trajectory optimization, reference trajectories, or
pre-computed gait libraries. Our controller is trained with large-scale
model-free reinforcement learning on an ensemble of randomized environments in
simulation and deployed to the real world in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
our approach in high-fidelity simulation and successfully deploy it to the real
robot as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of
a fully learning-based method for real-world full-sized humanoid locomotion.

					<dc:description>  Threshold activation functions are highly preferable in neural networks due
to their efficiency in hardware implementations. Moreover, their mode of
operation is more interpretable and resembles that of biological neurons.
However, traditional gradient based algorithms such as Gradient Descent cannot
be used to train the parameters of neural networks with threshold activations
since the activation function has zero gradient except at a single
non-differentiable point. To this end, we study weight decay regularized
training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first
show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be
equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which
parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a
certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation
when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network. We
corroborate our theoretical results with various numerical experiments.

					<dc:description>  As the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) came online last summer, we entered
a new era of astronomy. This new era is supported by data products of
unprecedented information content that require novel reduction and analysis
techniques. Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 (N22) highlighted the need for
upgraded opacity models to prevent facing a model-driven accuracy wall when
interpreting exoplanet transmission spectra. Here, we follow the same approach
as N22 to explore the sensitivity of inferences on the atmospheric properties
of WASP-39 b to the opacity models used. We find that the retrieval of the main
atmospheric properties from this first JWST exoplanet spectrum is mostly
unaffected by the current state of the community's opacity models. Abundances
of strong opacity sources like water and carbon dioxide are reliably
constrained within $\sim$0.30 dex, beyond the 0.50 dex accuracy wall reported
in N22. Assuming the completeness and accuracy of line lists, N22's accuracy
wall is primarily driven by model uncertainties on broadening coefficients and
far-wing behaviors, which we find to have marginal consequences for large, hot,
high-metallicity atmospheres such as WASP-39 b. The origin of the opacity
challenge in the retrieval of metal-rich hot Jupiters will thus mostly stem
from the incompleteness and inaccuracy of line lists -- as already highlighted
by unidentified absorption features in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39 b.

					<dc:description>  We develop a framework for non-asymptotic analysis of deterministic samplers
used for diffusion generative modeling. Several recent works have analyzed
stochastic samplers using tools like Girsanov's theorem and a chain rule
variant of the interpolation argument. Unfortunately, these techniques give
vacuous bounds when applied to deterministic samplers. We give a new
operational interpretation for deterministic sampling by showing that one step
along the probability flow ODE can be expressed as two steps: 1) a restoration
step that runs gradient ascent on the conditional log-likelihood at some
infinitesimally previous time, and 2) a degradation step that runs the forward
process using noise pointing back towards the current iterate. This perspective
allows us to extend denoising diffusion implicit models to general, non-linear
forward processes. We then develop the first polynomial convergence bounds for
these samplers under mild conditions on the data distribution.

					<dc:description>  We propose a method that simultaneously estimates and controls extrinsic
contact with tactile feedback. The method enables challenging manipulation
tasks that require controlling light forces and accurate motions in contact,
such as balancing an unknown object on a thin rod standing upright. A factor
graph-based framework fuses a sequence of tactile and kinematic measurements to
estimate and control the interaction between gripper-object-environment,
including the location and wrench at the extrinsic contact between the grasped
object and the environment and the grasp wrench transferred from the gripper to
the object. The same framework simultaneously plans the gripper motions that
make it possible to estimate the state while satisfying regularizing control
objectives to prevent slip, such as minimizing the grasp wrench and minimizing
frictional force at the extrinsic contact. We show results with sub-millimeter
contact localization error and good slip prevention even on slippery
environments, for multiple contact formations (point, line, patch contact) and
transitions between them. See supplementary video and results at

					<dc:title>Hierarchical Deep Learning Model for Degradation Prediction per
  Look-Ahead Scheduled Battery Usage Profile</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Zhao, Cunzhi</dc:creator>

					<dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  Batteries can effectively improve the security of energy systems and mitigate
climate change by facilitating wind and solar power. The installed capacity of
battery energy storage system (BESS), mainly the lithium ion batteries are
increasing significantly in recent years. However, the battery degradation
cannot be accurately quantified and integrated into energy management system
with existing heuristic battery degradation models. This paper proposed a
hierarchical deep learning based battery degradation quantification (HDL-BDQ)
model to quantify the battery degradation given scheduled BESS daily
operations. Particularly, two sequential and cohesive deep neural networks are
proposed to accurately estimate the degree of degradation using inputs of
battery operational profiles and it can significantly outperform existing fixed
or linear rate based degradation models as well as single-stage deep neural
models. Training results show the high accuracy of the proposed system.
Moreover, a learning and optimization decoupled algorithm is implemented to
strategically take advantage of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in
optimization-based look-ahead scheduling (LAS) problems. Case studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in LAS of a
microgrid testbed.

					<dc:title>Spin Foam Perturbation Theory</dc:title>
					<dc:creator>Baez, John C.</dc:creator>
					<dc:subject>General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</dc:subject>
					<dc:description>  We study perturbation theory for spin foam models on triangulated manifolds.
Starting with any model of this sort, we consider an arbitrary perturbation of
the vertex amplitudes, and write the evolution operators of the perturbed model
as convergent power series in the coupling constant governing the perturbation.
The terms in the power series can be efficiently computed when the unperturbed
model is a topological quantum field theory. Moreover, in this case we can
explicitly sum the whole power series in the limit where the number of
top-dimensional simplices goes to infinity while the coupling constant is
suitably renormalized. This `dilute gas limit' gives spin foam models that are
triangulation-independent but not topological quantum field theories. However,
we show that models of this sort are rather trivial except in dimension 2.

					<dc:title>R-matrix for a geodesic flow associated with a new integrable peakon

					<dc:description>  We use the r-matrix formulation to show the integrability of geodesic flow on
an $N$-dimensional space with coordinates $q_k$, with $k=1,...,N$, equipped
with the co-metric $g^{ij}=e^{-|q_i-q_j|}\big(2-e^{-|q_i-q_j|}\big)$. This flow
is generated by a symmetry of the integrable partial differential equation
(pde) $m_t+um_x+3mu_x=0, m=u-\alpha^2u_{xx}$ ($\al $ is a constant). This
equation -- called the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation -- was recently proven
to be completely integrable and possess peakon solutions by Degasperis, Holm
and Hone (DHH[2002]). The isospectral eigenvalue problem associated with the
integrable DP equation is used to find a new $L$-matrix, called the Lax matrix,
for the geodesic dynamical flow. By employing this Lax matrix we obtain the
$r$-matrix for the integrable geodesic flow.
